It&amp;#39;s like the ESC fires we disengage</text><text start="2814.94" dur="3.03">We&amp;#39;re like you got to be driving right now. Just like you should not use cruise control on the snow</text><text start="2817.97" dur="4.86">You should not use these systems if there&amp;#39;s snow on the road if there&amp;#39;s snow on the side of the road. Yes sure, it&amp;#39;s fine</text><text start="2824.88" dur="1.5">Robert</text><text start="2826.38" dur="2">Did you still have a question?</text><text start="2828.75" dur="3.739">My question was around you mentioned the cloud storage of the dashcam video</text><text start="2832.49" dur="5.61">Is that a subscription model or how does that work right now? It&amp;#39;s free, but we&amp;#39;re moving towards</text><text start="2838.32" dur="2">Yeah, we&amp;#39;re looking into that kind of stuff</text><text start="2841.2" dur="2">It&amp;#39;s expensive storage is expensive</text><text start="2843.75" dur="2.479">Ok Zee, and then we&amp;#39;ll pop back up this</text><text start="2847.05" dur="2.03">You&amp;#39;re tracking all the location data</text><text start="2850.02" dur="6.229">What is your how do you manage the privacy around that you by using our system you consent to giving us full access to all?</text><text start="2856.25" dur="1.18">the data</text><text start="2857.43" dur="4.25">If you don&amp;#39;t if you&amp;#39;re not ok with that, don&amp;#39;t use it. I&amp;#39;m very open about that. I&amp;#39;m not like Facebook</text><text start="2861.68" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;m not wishy-washy you are giving us all the data and we will use it for whatever we want if you&amp;#39;re not ok with that</text><text start="2866.09" dur="2">Don&amp;#39;t use the system</text><text start="2869.369" dur="5.93">Right side so I have two quick questions one is have you found any issues with</text><text start="2875.91" dur="1.82">contextualizing how people drive in different regions</text><text start="2877.73" dur="3.899">I know in Buenos Aires for example as soon as you see a yellow on the other direction</text><text start="2881.63" dur="4.08">You start going in see see where I&amp;#39;m from. You kind of let rides Lauren out</text><text start="2885.71" dur="5.369">I always imagine taking half DC drivers and half Buenos Aires drivers and watching what would happen</text><text start="2891.48" dur="4.01">So when you have these voting&amp;#39;s you have differing dimensions. The other one is is</text><text start="2896.79" dur="4.46">Are you looking at the attention data as people are going more confident in the system?</text><text start="2901.25" dur="7.049">Are they more willing or more likely to pull out their phone or start losing their attention because they don&amp;#39;t have to again here</text><text start="2908.3" dur="3.989">We&amp;#39;re starting to get in a situation where people are feeling pretty safe on this up on the highway</text><text start="2912.29" dur="2">And they&amp;#39;re not paying attention anymore</text><text start="2914.34" dur="6.89">This is why after the second Tesla accident where the guy hit the guardrail we&amp;#39;re like we have to ship driver monitoring immediately</text><text start="2921.23" dur="4.979">So right now if you&amp;#39;re driving and you look at your phone if you look at your phone for more than four seconds</text><text start="2926.21" dur="1.54">it will beep and</text><text start="2927.75" dur="4.159">Then it will continue to steer but it will stop gasps. It will stop doing the gas</text><text start="2932.13" dur="2.87">So if you are distracted, it won&amp;#39;t accelerate anymore</text><text start="2936.15" dur="4.88">And then people learn eventually if this becomes a problem, we&amp;#39;re also gonna put in lock outs</text><text start="2941.1" dur="3.86">But that hasn&amp;#39;t really become a problem yet. Tesla should do driver monitoring as well</text><text start="2945.69" dur="1.7">So yeah, as people have become more common</text><text start="2947.39" dur="5.28">That&amp;#39;s the danger as these things get better people pay attention less and that&amp;#39;s you just solved with driver monitoring make sure the driver actually</text><text start="2952.67" dur="2">Pays attention and punish them for not</text><text start="2955.65" dur="5.87">And then the contextualization of regions, oh regionalization. Um, so we just have a country filter right now</text><text start="2961.74" dur="4.489">Most of the data comes from America it works. The best in America driving is similar enough in America</text><text start="2966.23" dur="2.79">You will get into weird edge cases, maybe like the Pittsburgh left</text><text start="2969.02" dur="3.929">I think the way to solve that problem long term is to train different models for different regions</text><text start="2973.68" dur="4.129">It&amp;#39;s like the iPhone has different stuff. He&amp;#39;s loading the region model</text><text start="2978.57" dur="2">Okay, maybe time for one more</text><text start="2982.38" dur="2">You have a</text><text start="2984.42" dur="4.189">Security aspect of it. Sorry. Could you raise your hand wherever you are? Oh right in the middle</text><text start="2988.61" dur="5.4">Yes security aspect against hacking for Oakland pilot. Um, so</text><text start="2994.62" dur="4.219">Car hacking is one of these things that also people make a ton of money talking about in conferences</text><text start="2998.84" dur="2">Can you give an example of what it actually happened?</text><text start="3002.99" dur="2.599">But at least you have seen situations where people have</text><text start="3006.29" dur="5.48">You know had a gang, you know a regular laptop or something talking to the canvas</text><text start="3011.77" dur="2.609">Oh, yeah, I&amp;#39;ve seen I&amp;#39;ve seen Charlie Miller do a PR stunt</text><text start="3015.08" dur="5.059">But I&amp;#39;ve never seen car hacking does not appear to be an actual threat by malicious actors in the real world</text><text start="3020.51" dur="6.859">When it does I&amp;#39;ll consider it much more seriously, but like until it does like what are people really going to do. They&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="3028.01" dur="4.609">It&amp;#39;s not really a thing but use industry standard security. Don&amp;#39;t do stupid things</text><text start="3032.859" dur="5.429">Thank you speaking from experience though. If you want to sell your system in certain countries like China, yeah</text><text start="3039.01" dur="3.179">Oh, we&amp;#39;ve given up on that mark. Yeah, they have a lot of restrictions and</text><text start="3042.89" dur="2.899">They actually want to be able to monitor the AI</text><text start="3046.849" dur="1.651">because they&amp;#39;re very</text><text start="3048.5" dur="6.619">Paranoid about about cyber security our stuff gets into China through github. I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not touching that market</text><text start="3055.119" dur="2">I&amp;#39;m not working with no people like that</text><text start="3060.26" dur="6.02">Okay, well I personally think this was a great way to stop the conference cuz this is one of those</text><text start="3071.45" dur="2.209">This is a talk where I&amp;#39;m like one minute</text><text start="3073.66" dur="1.29">I&amp;#39;m like, yeah</text><text start="3074.95" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m really on board with that and then the next no I hate what you just said and then the next minute</text><text start="3078.28" dur="2.129">I&amp;#39;m like, yeah, I really and then I&amp;#39;m back to</text><text start="3081.859" dur="4.669">But talk about a provoking way to stop the conference George. Thanks very much</text></transcript>
