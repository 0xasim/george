start="55.48" dur="8.19">61 people Wow 61 people all right so</text><text start="58.829" dur="9.191">these this periscope is to get the world</text><text start="63.67" dur="7.68">know our port to a new car which is a</text><text start="68.02" dur="6.42">Subaru yeah nobody would have I mean</text><text start="71.35" dur="6.75">like I guess buddy would have expected</text><text start="74.44" dur="8.999">that cannot see because the new GF is</text><text start="78.1" dur="9.39">hidden under the trim which is why the</text><text start="83.439" dur="7.22">new GF is actually great so this is like</text><text start="87.49" dur="5.519">a first car that we ported using</text><text start="90.659" dur="4.871">something that does not require you to</text><text start="93.009" dur="6.271">permanently remove dreams from your car</text><text start="95.53" dur="5.46">and so you can put back your dreams it</text><text start="99.28" dur="2.85">would be very bad especially like for a</text><text start="100.99" dur="3.719">super or having to remove the dreams</text><text start="102.13" dur="5.61">because all these piece is like a single</text><text start="104.709" dur="5.461">trim so and there is not much space</text><text start="107.74" dur="4.439">underneath so the really the only</text><text start="110.17" dur="5.99">solution is developing something very</text><text start="112.179" dur="9.091">tiny and I just shuffle it in there and</text><text start="116.16" dur="9.04">it&amp;#39;s working great so some things it</text><text start="121.27" dur="6.599">doesn&amp;#39;t have any any switch so all this</text><text start="125.2" dur="4.22">which are controlled so the stock and</text><text start="127.869" dur="6.351">non stock is control to the Panda</text><text start="129.42" dur="10.899">so we repor pizzelle can and can control</text><text start="134.22" dur="9.34">relay and the relay decides if passing</text><text start="140.319" dur="8.791">through the stock system or actually</text><text start="143.56" dur="9.03">passing through open pilot so when panda</text><text start="149.11" dur="6">sees ten messages like ten messages that</text><text start="152.59" dur="5.91">open pilot wants to send to the car then</text><text start="155.11" dur="7.02">it automatically open the relay</text><text start="158.5" dur="7.08">and you disconnect the camera from the</text><text start="162.13" dur="5.76">rest of the canvas of the car and then</text><text start="165.58" dur="3.99">you can you can decide what to forward</text><text start="167.89" dur="6.63">and walk to a place so people can</text><text start="169.57" dur="6.42">actually water again so what else can we</text><text start="174.52" dur="4.13">say about is there any question see I</text><text start="175.99" dur="9.3">missed a lot of questions okay</text><text start="178.65" dur="10.63">where&amp;#39;s Jorge yep let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s see</text><text start="185.29" dur="7.74">no it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not your giraffe we we</text><text start="189.28" dur="6.38">built our own let&amp;#39;s see yeah no radar</text><text start="193.03" dur="5.94">everything&amp;#39;s done with the cameras so</text><text start="195.66" dur="5.079">yeah let alone implementation of open</text><text start="198.97" dur="4.41">pilots because there is no operator in</text><text start="200.739" dur="5.641">this car we can&amp;#39;t use the red so we let</text><text start="203.38" dur="5.88">the camera the eyesight system still do</text><text start="206.38" dur="4.74">the longitudinal controller and we just</text><text start="209.26" dur="3.66">take control of the data value it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="211.12" dur="7.95">similar to what we do with other cars</text><text start="212.92" dur="11.7">like you and I drew says how some other</text><text start="219.07" dur="9">in San Diego oh well you don&amp;#39;t come to</text><text

Oh gia frog see</text><text start="253.38" dur="6.81">it was a super heart well great the head</text><text start="256.709" dur="7.561">is aprox with you see oh yeah we did</text><text start="260.19" dur="6.75">bring we did bring some giraffe to show</text><text start="264.27" dur="8.81">off oh yeah so this piece up here which</text><text start="266.94" dur="10.83">has the Panda this so you have the obd2</text><text start="273.08" dur="7.03">rj45 and you have a 10 pin connector and</text><text start="277.77" dur="4.58">then you have what&amp;#39;s actually doing all</text><text start="280.11" dur="2.24">the work</text><text start="284.62" dur="5.549">he&amp;#39;s got a relay yeah yeah do a nice</text><text start="287.62" dur="5.88">water through yeah it&amp;#39;s great beef ten</text><text start="290.169" dur="6.75">pen 26 pin which is you&amp;#39;re gonna be your</text><text start="293.5" dur="6.75">car harness and that connects to the</text><text start="296.919" dur="7.441">camera this is just a prototype one the</text><text start="300.25" dur="7.32">other ones look a lot better yeah I mean</text><text start="304.36" dur="5.73">what has you do skies every day yeah the</text><text start="307.57" dur="6.33">relay which controls everything the 17</text><text start="310.09" dur="7.139">is what like go connects to your pan</text><text start="313.9" dur="8.91">announces it is on your car to 10 10</text><text start="317.229" dur="9.69">cozy Spears up to the Panda up to the</text><text start="322.81" dur="5.91">giraffe yes camera cover and the 2016 is</text><text start="326.919" dur="5.461">the single pin connect to do the single</text><text start="328.72" dur="7.23">connector that like connects the car to</text><text start="332.38" dur="7.23">the camera yep so if you lose if you</text><text start="335.95" dur="8.55">lose connection it&amp;#39;ll actually switch</text><text start="339.61" dur="6.809">back to stock automatically yeah I mean</text><text start="344.5" dur="4.05">we can test it basically yeah what</text><text start="346.419" dur="4.801">happens is like if open pile of stops</text><text start="348.55" dur="5.55">working or get disconnected after five</text><text start="351.22" dur="6.9">seconds the relay will automatically</text><text start="354.1" dur="6.54">close so if for example you connect the</text><text start="358.12" dur="4.5">yin or the enforce whatever reason stops</text><text start="360.64" dur="3.54">sending canned messages the car will</text><text start="362.62" dur="4.38">fault because you stopped sending</text><text start="364.18" dur="6.45">messages and then after five seconds you</text><text start="367" dur="6.15">will the relay will actually close and</text><text start="370.63" dur="4.08">you go back to stock of course you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="373.15" dur="3.81">gonna still have some faults in the car</text><text start="374.71" dur="4.65">but the idea is that when the car is off</text><text start="376.96" dur="4.29">you can disconnect your own and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="379.36" dur="6.36">the very simplest way to be back stock</text><text start="381.25" dur="6.63">yeah so the relay will not open if open</text><text start="385.72" dur="4.43">pilot is not sending Cal messages yeah</text><text start="387.88" dur="7.379">yeah</text><text start="390.15" dur="6.609">so okay how&amp;#39;s the torque the torque I</text><text start="395.259" dur="7.771">would say is definitely better than they</text><text start="396.759" dur="11.241">wound up it&amp;#39;s probably a little lower</text><text start="403.03" dur="8.43">than the Toyota there is a huge lag in</text><text start="408" dur="5.229">controlling in actuator controls so if</text><text start="411.46" dur="6.15">proof of weather is familiar weight of a</text><text start="413.229" dur="7.41">pilot code there is power there is one</text><text start="417.61" dur="7.14">piece in the code where we are called a</text><text start="420.639" dur="7.471">leg doctor it looks like and that&amp;#39;s set</text><text start="424.75" dur="5.31">2.4 seconds for four for the Subaru</text><text start="428.11" dur="6.279">which is a lot but it seems to be</text><text start="430.06" dur="8.139">working pretty well so that&amp;#39;s fine</text><text start="434.389" dur="9.33">and yes talk level talk level is descent</text><text start="438.199" dur="7.171">I would say stock ACC isn&amp;#39;t too bad the</text><text start="443.719" dur="3.69">problem is that now we&amp;#39;re stopped and</text><text start="445.37" dur="4.949">the car is gonna disabled so you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="447.409" dur="6.421">do stopping though it can bring you to</text><text start="450.319" dur="6.481">stop but then it will auto disable the</text><text start="453.83" dur="4.769">car I like is you see after three</text><text start="456.8" dur="5.399">seconds that you&amp;#39;re stopped somewhat</text><text start="458.599" dur="6.03">annoying I believe the reason why they</text><text start="462.199" dur="4.37">do that is because this car is like a</text><text start="464.629" dur="5.22">handbrake so it doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text><text start="466.569" dur="5.65">electronic part brake and so if you</text><text start="469.849" dur="5.011">don&amp;#39;t have a tronic back brake and</text><text start="472.219" dur="5.401">you&amp;#39;re stopped and something bad happens</text><text start="474.86" dur="4.98">and you want to be able to lock the car</text><text start="477.62" dur="5.579">and to block the car and have the car</text><text start="479.84" dur="6.09">standing still and so if you have an APB</text><text start="483.199" dur="9.93">you can do that if you have handbrake</text><text start="485.93" dur="9.93">you actually can so will this work on</text><text start="493.129" dur="6.57">the Impreza 2019 that&amp;#39;s what this is any</text><text start="495.86" dur="9.75">prison chosen 18 by the way yes so this</text><text start="499.699" dur="8.25">port will work with every Subaru that is</text><text start="505.61" dur="5.01">on the global platform so pretty much</text><text start="507.949" dur="6.72">every new Subaru Impreza&amp;#39;s started in</text><text start="510.62" dur="7.919">2019 I believe and the some of the 2018</text><text start="514.669" dur="5.49">and maybe even 17 outback are on me</text><text start="518.539" dur="5.011">somebody who wear the super can correct</text><text start="520.159" dur="5.37">me by did all the new Subaru cars are in</text><text start="523.55" dur="4.59">this global platform and so this sport</text><text start="525.529" dur="6.631">is written for for those cars with minor</text><text start="528.14" dur="6.24">modification I believe like a bunch of</text><text start="532.16" dur="4.08">people already did it for non global</text><text start="534.38" dur="4.05">platform Subaru you can&amp;#39;t you can still</text><text start="536.24" dur="4.92">use the port so it&amp;#39;s still like somewhat</text><text start="538.43" dur="5.61">like retroactive on cars that doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="541.16" dur="4.59">have cars that don&amp;#39;t have global</text><text start="544.04" dur="3.72">platform can still work with this port</text><text start="545.75" dur="3.39">so it&amp;#39;s not a big deal I think a bunch</text><text start="547.76" dur="5.639">of people ready did he turn on the</text><text start="549.14" dur="6.77">community yeah so I mean few more things</text><text start="553.399" dur="7.221">again about the port I would say</text><text start="555.91" dur="6.39">I would say like its pitcher like we</text><text start="560.62" dur="4.02">could probably put a bounty if somebody</text><text start="562.3" dur="5.07">can find a way to trigger like beeps and</text><text start="564.64" dur="5.97">alerts I worked it I don&amp;#39;t know like</text><text start="567.37" dur="5.219">they only alert and beeps well the only</text><text start="570.61" dur="7.86">beep beeping on the car that I could</text><text start="572.589" dur="7.981">find was when we turned off ACC so this</text><text start="578.47" dur="4.77">double beep these these double beep is a</text><text start="580.57" dur="5.79">beep that I can replicate I haven&amp;#39;t</text><text start="583.24" dur="5.31">found the easy way to do other type of</text><text start="586.36" dur="4.83">beeps maybe a repeated chime when there</text><text start="588.55" dur="4.44">is somewhat like some important alert to</text><text start="591.19" dur="3.54">display or things like that sir if</text><text start="592.99" dur="3.87">somebody finds like a good way to send</text><text start="594.73" dur="9.27">like an alert with definitely the great</text><text start="596.86" dur="9.36">that you know compiled a few guys how do</text><text start="604" dur="4.589">you like super reverses Honda and Toyota</text><text start="606.22" dur="5.46">I would say super always work toward</text><text start="608.589" dur="6.661">Anandi the good thing about on the night</text><text start="611.68" dur="5.37">deck is that we can do ACC and I would</text><text start="615.25" dur="4.92">say OCC is definitely better than the</text><text start="617.05" dur="7.11">stock ACC with Subaru you get the stock</text><text start="620.17" dur="6.51">ACC which isn&amp;#39;t too bad so in terms of a</text><text start="624.16" dur="7.38">pilot implementation I would say I would</text><text start="626.68" dur="7.44">say it&amp;#39;s better than on the parsha the</text><text start="631.54" dur="3.9">car itself at least impress I&amp;#39;m not so</text><text start="634.12" dur="2.07">impressed this is like understanding</text><text start="635.44" dur="3.99">Impreza</text><text

dur="3.149">it&amp;#39;s gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna improve like</text><text start="666.509" dur="5.851">driver monitoring we&amp;#39;re gonna add Subaru</text><text start="668.579" dur="6.391">support we are going to strongly reduce</text><text start="672.36" dur="5.64">the power consumption of the Panda when</text><text start="674.97" dur="4.89">the car is off one of the pain that</text><text

start="710.97" dur="3.419">because of the planet the pandas Gannett</text><text start="712.5" dur="3.959">is gonna last like several weeks so you</text><text start="714.389" dur="3.651">don&amp;#39;t

dur="4.73">improvement on power consumption on day</text><text start="722.3" dur="6.6">Monday but we will do more improvement</text><text start="724.96" dur="5.98">maybe I probably still within like five</text><text start="728.9" dur="4.92">eleven there are still few figures we</text><text start="730.94" dur="5.13">need to put you on and so everything</text><text start="733.82" dur="4.32">will be
