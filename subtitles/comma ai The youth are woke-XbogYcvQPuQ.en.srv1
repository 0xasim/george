dur="5.68">hardware with open-plan</text><text start="1549.77" dur="3.86">harder with the open pilots</text><text start="1556.14" dur="4.919">yes maybe a year maybe a year you think</text><text start="1559.47" dur="3.18">about it so when we do sell hardware</text><text start="1561.059" dur="3.721">with open pilot time so right now we</text><text start="1562.65" dur="4.08">only sell dash cams fairly unregulated</text><text start="1564.78" dur="5.66">and when we do sell hardware that is</text><text start="1566.73" dur="6.93">designed to drive a car we will have to</text><text start="1570.44" dur="4.51">register as a as probably I&amp;#39;m not a</text><text start="1573.66" dur="2.82">hundred percent sure on this but the way</text><text start="1574.95" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s looking now is what our register is</text><text start="1576.48" dur="4.22">a vehicle manufacturer with nishta so</text><text start="1578.91" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a bit of

start="1586.83" dur="5.7">downloaded software from github so</text><text start="1588.96" dur="5.7">justjust just remember that reliability</text><text start="1592.53" dur="5.639">is it&amp;#39;s great and so it allows things</text><text start="1594.66" dur="5.82">like open pilot to be possible for us to</text><text start="1598.169" dur="4.591">for us to give it away like this before</text><text start="1600.48" dur="7.079">we before we actually sell things with a</text><text start="1602.76" dur="8.13">pilot we need a few things we need money</text><text start="1607.559" dur="7.5">for the legal overhead we need to make</text><text start="1610.89" dur="5.789">sure our reporting stuff is very very</text><text start="1615.059" dur="4.74">reliable right it was a man in</text><text start="1616.679" dur="4.981">Pennsylvania who swerved across four</text><text start="1619.799" dur="4.471">lanes of traffic in his Tesla caused an</text><text start="1621.66" dur="3.63">accident and then when he was stopped by</text><text start="1624.27" dur="3.149">the police and they&amp;#39;re like why did you</text><text start="1625.29" dur="4.379">do that he&amp;#39;s like a well auto pilot did</text><text start="1627.419" dur="3.721">it and this is what he was reporting to</text><text start="1629.669" dur="3.091">the media and then of course Tesla</text><text start="1631.14" dur="1.98">ducked into the loft on his logs of his</text><text start="1632.76" dur="2.82">cars</text><text start="1633.12" dur="3.54">he had never turned on autopilot so we</text><text start="1635.58" dur="2.99">have to make sure we can prevent</text><text start="1636.66" dur="3.35">scenarios like that with good logging</text><text start="1638.57" dur="3.12">and we also have to make sure we</text><text start="1640.01" dur="4.2">understand what the classes of</text><text start="1641.69" dur="4.02">disengagement SAR and report that to</text><text start="1644.21" dur="3.21">users much better we have to make it</text><text start="1645.71" dur="3.63">like very clear in the user manual look</text><text start="1647.42" dur="3.72">here&amp;#39;s a scenario where your car
