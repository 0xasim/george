week&amp;#39;s episode we have the founder</text><text start="7.54" dur="7.91">and CEO of comedy I George ha George</text><text start="11.53" dur="7.35">Hotz welcome to the podcast George hi</text><text start="15.45" dur="6.04">yeah so I thought to really kind of dive</text><text start="18.88" dur="4.38">into some of the details on on some of</text><text start="21.49" dur="4.109">the autonomous technology that you guys</text><text start="23.26" dur="5.55">are developing we&amp;#39;d start by kind of</text><text start="25.599" dur="6.871">tackling the reason why you started this</text><text start="28.81" dur="6.15">company and you know why you didn&amp;#39;t kind</text><text start="32.47" dur="6.93">of jump along you know say Google</text><text start="34.96" dur="6.9">Google&amp;#39;s whammo project or uber or Tesla</text><text start="39.4" dur="3.81">and that sort of thing so what do you</text><text start="41.86" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s kind of your main reason for</text><text start="43.21" dur="3.66">starting common data AI because do you</text><text start="45.91" dur="3.78">really want to live in a world</text><text start="46.87" dur="4.5">controlled by way more oh that&amp;#39;s a great</text><text start="49.69" dur="4.53">question yeah</text><text start="51.37" dur="4.38">it seems it seems as though they&amp;#39;re kind</text><text start="54.22" dur="5.19">of pursuing something quite different</text><text start="55.75" dur="5.88">than say they did with Google&amp;#39;s even</text><text start="59.41" dur="4.74">their own search engine or what they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="61.63" dur="3.54">done with Android of course which at</text><text start="64.15" dur="4.47">which I know you&amp;#39;ve been quite vocal</text><text start="65.17" dur="4.68">about and so you know how are you guys</text><text start="68.62" dur="3.3">approaching it from a different angle</text><text start="69.85" dur="5.1">than some of those bigger companies</text><text start="71.92" dur="5.01">developing this technology well I mean</text><text start="74.95" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s not just a question of you know a</text><text start="76.93" dur="3.63">different angle it&amp;#39;s a question of who&amp;#39;s</text><text start="78.49" dur="4.38">gonna win and who&amp;#39;s gonna lose</text><text start="80.56" dur="5.16">wham-o and Google I&amp;#39;m sorry way mo and</text><text start="82.87" dur="4.65">uber operate in bubbles um they operate</text><text start="85.72" dur="3.42">in enclosed bubbles where they think</text><text start="87.52" dur="4.41">that they can control the entire stack</text><text start="89.14" dur="5.78">of mobility no and he&amp;#39;ll mm-hmm and so</text><text start="91.93" dur="5.61">you see it kind of being a multiple</text><text start="94.92" dur="4.27">company operation in terms of someone&amp;#39;s</text><text start="97.54" dur="4.26">getting the ride shares called someone&amp;#39;s</text><text start="99.19" dur="3.9">operating the autonomous technology and</text><text start="101.8" dur="3.179">you know some other company might</text><text start="103.09" dur="4.02">maintain the vehicles and that sort of</text><text start="104.979" dur="3.511">thing forget about it this is the kind</text><text start="107.11" dur="3.72">of people who spend their day like</text><text start="108.49" dur="3.78">jerking off about the future no</text><text start="110.83" dur="3.03">seriously though they spent like oh the</text><text start="112.27" dur="3.389">world is gonna transform in ten years</text><text start="113.86" dur="3.21">now right now people buy cars and they</text><text start="115.659" dur="3.031">crash right how do you make them buy</text><text start="117.07" dur="4.17">cars that don&amp;#39;t crash i Tesla&amp;#39;s got this</text><text start="118.69" dur="4.109">right so instead of you know tackling it</text><text start="121.24" dur="3.66">you know with some like you said some</text><text start="122.799" dur="3.961">kind of futuristic mindset you you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="124.9" dur="4.139">kind of approaching it from you know how</text><text start="126.76" dur="4.32">can we improve the safety and how can we</text><text start="129.039" dur="3.391">move it where people will accept it you</text><text start="131.08" dur="4.03">know a lot faster rather but how do you</text><text start="132.43" dur="4.03">win right yeah how do you how you win</text><text start="135.11" dur="3.57">seven cars and I said this since the</text><text start="136.46" dur="3.51">beginning right the way Moe an uber</text><text start="138.68" dur="2.67">approach doesn&amp;#39;t win</text><text start="139.97" dur="2.85">I mean uber has more of a shot of that</text><text start="141.35" dur="3.27">than way Moe look at Google Fiber right</text><text start="142.82" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s a great ISP how many places have it</text><text start="144.62" dur="3.57">- yeah yeah right</text><text start="146.93" dur="2.85">it was a little burr fiber all right</text><text start="148.19" dur="4.02">maybe maybe they&amp;#39;d be able to roll out</text><text start="149.78" dur="5.31">the the ISP but kudou be really handled</text><text start="152.21" dur="4.44">the technological challenges no it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="155.09" dur="3.33">just not the way the world is gonna play</text><text start="156.65" dur="3.42">out the world&amp;#39;s gonna play out a whole</text><text start="158.42" dur="3.24">lot more like what you&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text><text start="160.07" dur="3.72">smartphone industry right I mean this</text><text start="161.66" dur="5.01">happened before in computing this idea</text><text start="163.79" dur="4.74">of thin clients this is all you can you</text><text start="166.67" dur="3.24">can trace this back 40 years like this I</text><text start="168.53" dur="1.86">did Oh everyone&amp;#39;s just gonna own a thin</text><text start="169.91" dur="1.92">client</text><text start="170.39" dur="2.64">we&amp;#39;re not even all in the thin climb</text><text start="171.83" dur="2.31">maybe it&amp;#39;ll just rent the thin client</text><text start="173.03" dur="3.03">from the other leg everyone will have</text><text start="174.14" dur="3.99">Bloomberg terminals I mean this isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="176.06" dur="5.73">how computing happened right mm-hmm and</text><text start="178.13" dur="7.8">so when you&amp;#39;re looking at developing</text><text start="181.79" dur="6.54">internally it come a you know your cars</text><text start="185.93" dur="3.21">are they still using lidar like uber and</text><text start="188.33" dur="2.67">and way moe</text><text start="189.14" dur="4.16">or are you moving towards the more</text><text start="191" dur="5.33">computer vision aspect of development</text><text start="193.3" dur="5.89">well I mean that&amp;#39;s a technology choice</text><text start="196.33" dur="5.17">I&amp;#39;m not sure why the reason people</text><text start="199.19" dur="3.84">fixated on lidar is because way moe does</text><text start="201.5" dur="4.799">have a technological lead and because</text><text start="203.03" dur="4.44">they use lidar if the year is 2005 and</text><text start="206.299" dur="3.271">you just witnessed</text><text start="207.47" dur="4.2">everybody lose miserably at the DARPA</text><text start="209.57" dur="4.169">Grand Challenge in 2004 lighter gets</text><text start="211.67" dur="5.34">invented people start winning in 2005</text><text start="213.739" dur="5.991">lighter looks like a great idea fast</text><text start="217.01" dur="6.06">forward you know almost 15 years</text><text start="219.73" dur="5.65">computer vision is amazing the AI</text><text start="223.07" dur="4.949">revolution is happening computer vision</text><text start="225.38" dur="4.59">is superhuman in some categories and</text><text start="228.019" dur="4.021">cameras have this two huge advantages</text><text start="229.97" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re cheap and they&amp;#39;re passive right</text><text start="232.04" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t want a sensor on your car that</text><text start="233.69" dur="3.87">has to actively emit stuff</text><text start="235.58" dur="4.62">this isn&amp;#39;t how humans drive right humans</text><text start="237.56" dur="5.88">drive by humans don&amp;#39;t have any active</text><text start="240.2" dur="4.56">sensors there&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s bats too but</text><text start="243.44" dur="2.49">like um no humans don&amp;#39;t have active</text><text start="244.76" dur="2.67">sensors right you don&amp;#39;t want active</text><text start="245.93" dur="4.05">sensors active sensors interfere with</text><text start="247.43" dur="3.66">each other on the they&amp;#39;re more likely to</text><text start="249.98" dur="2.37">you know be thrown by their own</text><text start="251.09" dur="3.209">interference because you have both a</text><text start="252.35" dur="5.16">transmit and a received pathway and</text><text start="254.299" dur="5.821">lidar is ridiculously expensive and so</text><text start="257.51" dur="4.44">yeah I&amp;#39;ve talked about that with some of</text><text start="260.12" dur="5.13">some executives in the you know kind of</text><text start="261.95" dur="4.68">evie space or autonomy space and they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="265.25" dur="2.87">they&amp;#39;ve always said that they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="266.63" dur="3.5">always you know</text><text start="268.12" dur="4.32">kind of emphasized oh well lidar works</text><text start="270.13" dur="4.74">really well except for the fact that</text><text start="272.44" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to manufacture and</text><text start="274.87" dur="5.4">it cost a crazy amount of money it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="277.51" dur="4.29">also like it doesn&amp;#39;t work well here&amp;#39;s</text><text start="280.27" dur="3.03">the thing right when you think about the</text><text start="281.8" dur="3.51">the problems involved in self-driving</text><text start="283.3" dur="4.02">cars there&amp;#39;s like a perception problem</text><text start="285.31" dur="3.96">and then there&amp;#39;s a planning problem</text><text start="287.32" dur="3.72">right the lidar only helps you with the</text><text start="289.27" dur="3.06">perception part of that problem</text><text start="291.04" dur="3.24">maybe there&amp;#39;s perception planning and</text><text start="292.33" dur="3.6">localization sure the lighter might help</text><text start="294.28" dur="3.12">you with perception localization but</text><text start="295.93" dur="4.47">when it comes to planning we&amp;#39;re really</text><text start="297.4" dur="4.89">all the hard problems lie it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="300.4" dur="3.99">matter right like that&amp;#39;s we are much</text><text start="302.29" dur="4.23">better at like object classification</text><text start="304.39" dur="4.5">detection and recognition and computer</text><text start="306.52" dur="4.89">vision than we are at like complicated</text><text start="308.89" dur="4.92">decision-making required for actually</text><text start="311.41" dur="4.44">driving cars um it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just such</text><text start="313.81" dur="3.51">a trivial part of the problem it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="315.85" dur="3.18">we were playing Monopoly and the first</text><text start="317.32" dur="3.24">thing I focused on was well you know you</text><text start="319.03" dur="2.7">have to build your houses evenly on the</text><text start="320.56" dur="2.37">property you can&amp;#39;t put three houses</text><text start="321.73" dur="3.93">there in one house that&amp;#39;s irrelevant</text><text start="322.93" dur="4.53">right mm-hmm and and so when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="325.66" dur="4.59">talking about computer vision technology</text><text start="327.46" dur="4.89">and how much it&amp;#39;s advanced in the past</text><text start="330.25" dur="3.69">you know 10 15 years where do you think</text><text start="332.35" dur="4.89">we are on kind of the road map to</text><text start="333.94" dur="5.76">computer vision you know being advanced</text><text start="337.24" dur="5.25">enough to handle you know commercialize</text><text start="339.7" dur="4.8">self-driving vehicles it already is you</text><text start="342.49" dur="4.11">think it already it&amp;#39;s at the level where</text><text start="344.5" dur="4.46">it&amp;#39;s gonna recognize it enough stuff and</text><text start="346.6" dur="5.01">provide enough input into the the AI</text><text start="348.96" dur="4.84">develop software and kind of control the</text><text start="351.61" dur="5.64">vehicle and a you know advanced</text><text start="353.8" dur="5.7">commercialized level yeah I&amp;#39;m telling</text><text start="357.25" dur="4.83">you if all I had was the AI technology</text><text start="359.5" dur="4.41">today for vision I can we have a demo on</text><text start="362.08" dur="3.3">our Twitter where we we use a segment</text><text start="363.91" dur="3.48">and a depth that we basically output a</text><text start="365.38" dur="4.71">lidar we output a point cloud of the</text><text start="367.39" dur="4.02">world around us a segmented point cloud</text><text start="370.09" dur="3.66">which is even better we know which the</text><text start="371.41" dur="6.12">objects are right that&amp;#39;s the easy part</text><text start="373.75" dur="4.8">the hard part is okay I&amp;#39;m trying to</text><text start="377.53" dur="2.85">merge up here</text><text start="378.55" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s my model for how that person&amp;#39;s</text><text start="380.38" dur="3.27">going to be hey of assuming the bad</text><text start="381.97" dur="4.08">person stepping on the brakes and being</text><text start="383.65" dur="4.92">able to represent all of that predictive</text><text start="386.05" dur="4.05">complexity particularly predictive</text><text start="388.57" dur="3.36">complexity where there&amp;#39;s search right</text><text start="390.1" dur="4.26">and you have to search when you can take</text><text start="391.93" dur="4.56">actions okay if I move my car to the</text><text start="394.36" dur="4.44">left here what will the other cars do</text><text start="396.49" dur="4.109">being able to reason like that in terms</text><text start="398.8" dur="2.35">of counterfactuals AI is really bad at</text><text start="400.599" dur="3.1">still</text><text start="401.15" dur="4.44">and so what do you think needs to take</text><text start="403.699" dur="5.011">place and in terms of AI development to</text><text start="405.59" dur="4.2">get it to that level I mean you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="408.71" dur="2.37">starting to see you&amp;#39;re certainly just</text><text start="409.79" dur="2.129">looking look at alphago look it look</text><text start="411.08" dur="2.73">what just happened</text><text start="411.919" dur="3.78">alphago zero like reinforcement learning</text><text start="413.81" dur="3.99">works if you have access to a really</text><text start="415.699" dur="3.571">powerful simulator the question is where</text><text start="417.8" dur="4.5">do you get a really powerful simulator</text><text start="419.27" dur="4.679">for for self-driving now you could try</text><text start="422.3" dur="3.06">to code your own simulator but you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="423.949" dur="3.72">running into the hand coding problem</text><text start="425.36" dur="3.6">again just in terms of graphics and not</text><text start="427.669" dur="3.841">vision right you&amp;#39;re coding the graphics</text><text start="428.96" dur="3.81">part not the vision part umm yeah and</text><text start="431.51" dur="2.67">you&amp;#39;re Simula is probably gonna be</text><text start="432.77" dur="2.82">pretty restrictive so what you want to</text><text start="434.18" dur="5.58">do is you either want to learn a</text><text start="435.59" dur="5.67">simulator or you want to use the world</text><text start="439.76" dur="5.1">as your simulator and figure out how to</text><text start="441.26" dur="6.029">do that safely and so when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="444.86" dur="5.76">talking about using computer vision and</text><text start="447.289" dur="5.461">in combination with AI on this level for</text><text start="450.62" dur="3.75">self-driving vehicles you know there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="452.75" dur="3.62">not a lot of vehicle or not a lot of</text><text start="454.37" dur="4.53">companies kind of pursuing that model</text><text start="456.37" dur="6.22">but one of the only other ones out there</text><text start="458.9" dur="5.1">is of course Tesla&amp;#39;s autopilot and it</text><text start="462.59" dur="2.73">seems like the development there has</text><text start="464" dur="5.13">been a little bit bumpy over at least</text><text start="465.32" dur="5.79">the past year and a half or so with you</text><text start="469.13" dur="4.259">know Chris Lautner leaving earlier this</text><text start="471.11" dur="4.29">year and the be whole sterling Anderson</text><text start="473.389" dur="3.9">issue unfolding earlier this year in</text><text start="475.4" dur="3.15">past last year</text><text start="477.289" dur="4.021">what do you think are some of the</text><text start="478.55" dur="4.049">challenges that that Tesla&amp;#39;s facing to</text><text start="481.31" dur="4.56">bringing some of these features and</text><text start="482.599" dur="4.621">developing AI to a level of where they</text><text start="485.87" dur="4.44">can bring that full self-driving</text><text start="487.22" dur="5.61">technology to the vehicles he only has</text><text start="490.31" dur="4.139">an idea in his head he has an ideas head</text><text start="492.83" dur="3.57">that it should be easy and he&amp;#39;s right it</text><text start="494.449" dur="3.78">absolutely should be easy so every time</text><text start="496.4" dur="3.81">someone doesn&amp;#39;t make it seem easy he</text><text start="498.229" dur="4.861">fires them which is actually probably a</text><text start="500.21" dur="4.139">good strategy so what&amp;#39;s the problem I</text><text start="503.09" dur="2.549">mean it&amp;#39;s just actually implementing all</text><text start="504.349" dur="3.961">the stuff mean implementation is hard</text><text start="505.639" dur="4.861">mm-hmm no it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not the</text><text start="508.31" dur="4.05">theory the theory is like all there and</text><text start="510.5" dur="3.659">so when do you think you know

potential customer</text><text start="861.62" dur="5.13">mm-hmm and in one one of the players</text><text start="864.86" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve kind of been not talking about but</text><text start="866.75" dur="4.44">some of these newcomers in the</text><text start="868.49" dur="4.62">automotive space and as you&amp;#39;ve said you</text><text start="871.19" dur="3.42">know if you present the right technology</text><text start="873.11" dur="3.69">in the right way it seems like the</text><text start="874.61" dur="3.84">capital kind of follows follows along</text><text start="876.8" dur="4.2">but what do you think about some of</text><text start="878.45" dur="5.55">these other newcomers say something like</text><text start="881" dur="5.34">Rivia n-- or lucid motors or neo you</text><text start="884" dur="3.72">know and what are those guys oh you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="886.34" dur="3.78">talking about the Chinese companies that</text><text start="887.72" dur="4.83">think they&amp;#39;re gonna make cars in terms</text><text start="890.12" dur="5.67">of you know how do you think they play</text><text start="892.55" dur="5.1">in the environment and especially in the</text><text start="895.79" dur="4.08">self-driving environment you know to be</text><text start="897.65" dur="4.11">fair Eevee&amp;#39;s are a lot easier to make</text><text start="899.87" dur="3.12">today when you look around you look</text><text start="901.76" dur="2.43">around say look like SpaceX and Tesla</text><text start="902.99" dur="2.04">right when you look around at SpaceX</text><text start="904.19" dur="2.34">like there&amp;#39;s nothing really</text><text start="905.03" dur="3.39">fundamentally that makes rockets that</text><text start="906.53" dur="3.57">much easier to build today then they</text><text start="908.42" dur="3.36">even were to build in like you know a</text><text start="910.1" dur="3.27">long time ago even like the 60s or the</text><text start="911.78" dur="3.18">70s right okay you have fancy or</text><text start="913.37" dur="3.48">guidance computers maybe you can do your</text><text start="914.96" dur="3.9">your recoveries and your nice landings</text><text start="916.85" dur="3.51">but when you look at electric cars oh</text><text start="918.86" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s so easy today</text><text start="920.36" dur="3.87">Oh a kid could build an electric car in</text><text start="922.28" dur="4.08">a garage you buy a pre-manufactured</text><text start="924.23" dur="4.08">battery pack a pre-manufactured powerful</text><text start="926.36" dur="4.53">motor power and pull inverter and boom</text><text start="928.31" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;ve built an electric car um so is it</text><text start="930.89" dur="3.45">possible for these companies to succeed</text><text start="932.39" dur="5.7">yeah maybe</text><text start="934.34" dur="5.34">and so kind of back to when you got kind</text><text start="938.09" dur="4.89">of started and interested in doing</text><text start="939.68" dur="5.66">self-driving cars you you said that Elon</text><text start="942.98" dur="5.01">Musk kind of approached you to possibly</text><text start="945.34" dur="5.02">run the auto pilot division how did that</text><text start="947.99" dur="4.92">kind of shake out and did you have any</text><text start="950.36" dur="4.26">interest of joining Tesla well I was</text><text start="952.91" dur="3.24">supposed to be a contract I&amp;#39;m supposed</text><text start="954.62"

I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="960.71" dur="8.64">like to lose so I&amp;#39;ll be here a long time</text><text start="963.46" dur="7.96">and so you know do you think that AI</text><text start="969.35" dur="4.71">development is kind of reaching some of</text><text start="971.42" dur="4.89">these levels that that will pose a</text><text start="974.06" dur="7.32">threat as kind of Elon

every</text><text start="997.94" dur="4.02">weapon in history that I&amp;#39;m not sure I</text><text start="999.56" dur="4.97">believe but once these powerful agencies</text><text start="1001.96" dur="4.35">get their hand on AI well you know</text><text start="1004.53" dur="4.18">nuclear bombs aren&amp;#39;t very useful</text><text start="1006.31" dur="3.81">tactically AI is so that&amp;#39;s what you got</text><text start="1008.71" dur="3.27">to watch out for way more than like a</text><text start="1010.12" dur="3.6">runaway a eye control problem kind of</text><text start="1011.98"
