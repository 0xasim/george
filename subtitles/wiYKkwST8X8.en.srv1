update from</text><text start="20.23" dur="3.09">comma research for you guys</text><text start="21.64" dur="4.849">so I&amp;#39;m handing it off to editor and</text><text start="23.32" dur="3.169">Herald but I&amp;#39;m doing the filming</text><text start="28.45" dur="9.24">come on researchers off see this is</text><text start="30.13" dur="9.9">Connor research crew oh you know what I</text><text start="37.69" dur="7.41">should find it was too late but I should</text><text start="40.03" dur="10.92">have I should find a stabilizer it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="45.1"

drivers</text><text start="54.34" dur="7.53">monitoring really alright guys so coma</text><text start="59.95" dur="3.66">research has three things to tell you</text><text start="61.87" dur="6.21">right so the three announcements don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="63.61" dur="8.31">read the board know like them so how</text><text start="68.08" dur="6.03">many people do you have we have

dur="4.981">three things</text><text start="78" dur="7.03">waha beitia say Babesia it&amp;#39;s like the</text><text start="81.85" dur="4.95">goatee or something all right so three</text><text start="85.03" dur="5.57">things that come on research is active</text><text start="86.8" dur="7.29">so coma research is not to desert it we</text><text start="90.6" dur="8.23">make projects so it&amp;#39;s R squared the dill</text><text start="94.09" dur="6.089">and the 888 project so this is for you</text><text start="98.83" dur="3.599">guys to understand what we will be doing</text><text start="100.179" dur="3.871">right because we announced the coma</text><text start="102.429" dur="2.671">research but now we have to know what</text><text start="104.05" dur="2.819">come on research is going to be doing</text><text start="105.1" dur="3.03">and how is it different from call</text><text start="106.869" dur="3.301">product is it different</text><text start="108.13" dur="3.239">so the question because the first thing</text><text start="110.17" dur="2.699">that we want to make sure is that</text><text start="111.369" dur="4.101">research and coma</text><text start="112.869" dur="5.581">oh I all the research in other places</text><text start="115.47" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s not a scam right usual research is</text><text start="118.45" dur="6.6">just this multi-level marketing campaign</text><text start="122.8" dur="3.84">where you just like the research publish</text><text start="125.05" dur="3.12">papers go to go first so you can hire</text><text start="126.64" dur="3.179">more researchers and your company can</text><text start="128.17" dur="3.899">look all right until you hire real</text><text start="129.819" dur="4.53">workers that do all the job mm-hmm so</text><text start="132.069" dur="4.231">common research is different by the fact</text><text start="134.349" dur="5.701">that the research also makes real things</text><text start="136.3" dur="5.73">here on this R square we will be doing</text><text start="140.05" dur="3.659">are you breaking common research yes</text><text start="142.03" dur="5.3">people are saying where&amp;#39;s the stream at</text><text start="143.709" dur="3.621">it what&amp;#39;s happening are we not live</text><text start="147.87" dur="4.089">someone responds with notes fine okay</text><text start="150.099"

you have</text><text start="176.61" dur="4.65">you guys heard about the big model you</text><text start="179.58" dur="3.659">been here dude everyone knows that big</text><text start="181.26" dur="3.93">model everyone knows about big mall but</text><text start="183.239" dur="3.78">there are the issues about the big mall</text><text start="185.19" dur="3.659">right the big boulders big entrance a</text><text start="187.019" dur="4.381">lot of energy so one of the things that</text><text start="188.849" dur="4.741">our square is gonna do is this stilll</text><text start="191.4" dur="4.619">whatever big mobile knows into a small</text><text start="193.59" dur="4.17">model so it&amp;#39;s model drugs just as good</text><text start="196.019" dur="9.03">as big model so that&amp;#39;s one of the things</text><text start="197.76" dur="13.05">there wow yeah big deal yeah no no</text><text start="205.049" dur="7.711">Oh big deal okay big deal is the deal so</text><text

dur="3.81">important to do is because they do get</text><text start="222.15" dur="3.39">some like a lot of space on that no that</text><text start="224.22" dur="3.03">makes no sense you need to explain what</text><text start="225.54" dur="3.39">no it doesn&amp;#39;t matter it gets a lot of</text><text start="227.25" dur="2.03">space and this is important that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="228.93" dur="2.82">matters</text><text start="229.28" dur="6.88">orange no you&amp;#39;re talking about literal</text><text start="231.75" dur="7.739">space yeah there&amp;#39;s gonna be a quiz at</text><text start="236.16" dur="6.75">the end so you know the bill is stands</text><text start="239.489" dur="9">for the driving intermediate layer or</text><text start="242.91" dur="6.96">language or language it&amp;#39;s what guys so</text><text start="248.489" dur="3.421">you have to understand this because this</text><text start="249.87" dur="4.14">is pretty much the future oh no</text><text start="251.91" dur="5.37">seriously listen listen listen stop stop</text><text start="254.01" dur="6.3">right there okay deal no big deal</text><text start="257.28" dur="6.87">is what is a second driving car right a</text><text start="260.31" dur="7.02">self-driving car is a three pieces piece</text><text start="264.15" dur="6.12">of technology right it&amp;#39;s that humor it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="267.33" dur="4.49">the car itself and it&amp;#39;s the AI and each</text><text start="270.27" dur="4.35">one of them speaks a different language</text><text start="271.82" dur="4.719">the human doesn&amp;#39;t think of like how much</text><text start="274.62" dur="4.049">accelerate how much I want to steer now</text><text start="276.539" dur="5.731">the human nose I want to get there this</text><text start="278.669" dur="5.041">fast right and you a car</text><text start="282.27" dur="3.269">is this mechanical thing that is done</text><text start="283.71" dur="4.019">and then there&amp;#39;s daily act which is the</text><text start="285.539" dur="3.391">software each one of them speaks</text><text start="287.729" dur="3.15">different language and then you have a</text><text start="288.93" dur="5.629">bunch of blue code that communicates</text><text start="290.879" dur="13.59">them the dill is here to solve that the</text><text start="294.559" dur="12.311">language between the car and the AI and</text><text start="304.469" dur="11.88">we have a lived some weeks weekend</text><text start="306.87" dur="12.469">little bit I know but it my phone</text><text start="316.349" dur="2.99">accidentally went quickly</text><text start="320.599" dur="7.06">okay well show you someone wait ready</text><text start="324.439" dur="5.861">dopey boom oh this is the you know the</text><text start="327.659" dur="5.91">debug so this is the dill right here</text><text start="330.3" dur="5.31">mm-hmm this is kind of what we expect to</text><text start="333.569" dur="5.611">be the common language between the car</text><text start="335.61" dur="6.329">and the AI so it just goes through like</text><text start="339.18" dur="4.53">where the lanes the red shows you where</text><text start="341.939" dur="3.391">the driving limit is so you clearly</text><text start="343.71" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t want to drive in the trees so</text><text start="345.33" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s where the the red lines separates</text><text start="347.46" dur="4.799">that when the orange is the lanes and</text><text start="349.74" dur="4.409">lane markings and then the yellow is</text><text start="352.259" dur="5.791">where the other cars are from the radar</text><text start="354.149" dur="6.51">so the idea is that we can make a model</text><text start="358.05" dur="4.289">that will be able to you know generate</text><text start="360.659" dur="3.57">these types of this type of</text><text start="362.339" dur="3.63">representation of the world as you can</text><text start="364.229" dur="4.321">see on the right and that should be</text><text start="365.969" dur="6.51">enough to be able to control the car yes</text><text start="368.55" dur="6.209">and navigate yeah you look at that you</text><text start="372.479" dur="3.81">know exactly where your room is so does</text><text start="374.759" dur="5.34">the AI so that&amp;#39;s a car</text><text start="376.289" dur="5.331">we are leaking secrets mostly that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="380.099" dur="4.081">enough that&amp;#39;s enough you&amp;#39;re right you</text><text start="381.62" dur="6.279">don&amp;#39;t want to look too much into</text><text start="384.18" dur="5.34">surprises yeah yeah okay so that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="387.899" dur="3.69">deal guys that this is the common</text><text start="389.52" dur="3.81">language so and here here goes the</text><text start="391.589" dur="4.021">question why do you want to build this</text><text start="393.33" dur="3.899">unified language right so if you are a</text><text start="395.61" dur="3.299">person and you understand where a</text><text start="397.229" dur="4.881">self-driving car is doing so it&amp;#39;s too</text><text start="398.909" dur="5.4">safe if you are a customer electronic</text><text start="402.11" dur="4.959">company like Samsung wherever or</text><text start="404.309" dur="4.681">something and you want your copper your</text><text start="407.069" dur="3.27">devices student look understand</text><text start="408.99" dur="3.209">self-driving cars to understand right</text><text start="410.339" dur="3.87">now well you can drive the car you have</text><text start="412.199" dur="2.661">to spit the deal and if you are an OPM</text><text start="414.209" dur="2.661">if you are</text><text start="414.86" dur="3.269">car company and you want your car to</text><text start="416.87" dur="3.18">interface with this common language</text><text start="418.129" dur="3.421">there&amp;#39;s gonna be bass Tanner it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="420.05" dur="4.079">be you don&amp;#39;t understand how big this is</text><text start="421.55" dur="6.54">gonna be but but yeah I feel guests can</text><text start="424.129" dur="5.671">understand you guys recently but today</text><text start="428.09" dur="3.09">if today you want to start speaking</text><text start="429.8" dur="3.299">they&amp;#39;ll if you think your company should</text><text start="431.18" dur="4.259">start speaking the deal you guys should</text><text start="433.099" dur="4.41">call Ricardo Ricardo Sarna CEO everybody</text><text start="435.439" dur="4.681">knows Ricardo so follow up with Ricardo</text><text start="437.509" dur="10.051">is be more than happy been his email is</text><text start="440.12" dur="9.12">viv at common dad I am so the last thing</text><text start="447.56" dur="5.94">that we have to tell them but not least</text><text start="449.24" dur="7.59">is the Aiden a product unfortunately we</text><text start="453.5" dur="4.59">cannot leak the full meaning of what a</text><text start="456.83" dur="6.359">deviated stance</text><text start="458.09" dur="7.139">yeah but 88 projects about HD maps and</text><text start="463.189" dur="5.97">we all know how how much you guys are</text><text start="465.229" dur="7.41">excited about HTML so we can announce</text><text start="469.159" dur="3.931">that there will be data lots of data big</text><text start="472.639" dur="1.68">data</text><text start="473.09" dur="4.919">Aaron wants to make sure you guys</text><text start="474.319" dur="6.27">understand it it&amp;#39;s very big and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="478.009" dur="4.77">also open source software with big data</text><text start="480.589" dur="4.26">because just data&amp;#39;s cheap without</text><text start="482.779" dur="4.32">software right guys so there will be a</text><text start="484.849" dur="4.56">lot of data and here I want to show you</text><text start="487.099" dur="3.271">guys a little bit of what this thing is</text><text start="489.409" dur="4.97">gonna look like</text><text start="490.37" dur="8.07">so the idea of making self-driving cars</text><text start="494.379" dur="5.681">HD maps is by making sure your car can</text><text start="498.44" dur="5.129">understand how far away things are right</text><text start="500.06" dur="17.58">so we are working on right now we want</text><text start="503.569" dur="16.981">to work on but we are working something</text><text start="517.64" dur="6.54">for you guys which is that vision for</text><text start="520.55" dur="7.289">young so we&amp;#39;ll have that vision for you</text><text start="524.18" dur="8.46">this is a young image and precisely this</text><text start="527.839" dur="7.201">image not that one but some other image</text><text start="532.64" dur="3.689">there is some where and then I have a</text><text start="535.04" dur="4.62">bunch of visualizations don&amp;#39;t worry</text><text start="536.329" dur="5.731">about it so there is this one here and</text><text start="539.66" dur="2.96">this one I know exactly where the image</text><text start="542.06" dur="2.12">is</text><text start="542.62" dur="4.88">got a clique damages you guys are gonna</text><text start="544.18" dur="6.96">see the images so an image like this</text><text start="547.5" dur="4.39">this is what a regular young you can see</text><text start="551.14" dur="4.11">yeah</text><text start="551.89" dur="10.11">and business and young with 3d vision</text><text start="555.25" dur="8.25">Wow so yeah humans of that well yeah so</text><text start="562" dur="3.69">they aliens gonna be able to see in 3d</text><text start="563.5" dur="6.3">you&amp;#39;re gonna be able to see how far away</text><text start="565.69" dur="6.12">things are and that goes into the dill</text><text start="569.8" dur="8.64">right because the deal understands</text><text start="571.81" dur="8.61">distance the deal understand but that</text><text start="578.44" dur="4.41">also goes into the HD maps and that goes</text><text start="580.42" dur="4.32">into they attain a project and if you</text><text start="582.85" dur="5.13">want to make sure by the way EDA is</text><text start="584.74" dur="6.6">about open source data right and beauty</text><text start="587.98" dur="5.43">HD maps here&amp;#39;s one thing about beauty</text><text start="591.34" dur="3.69">hmm what&amp;#39;s the point of working out by</text><text start="593.41" dur="4.53">the way huh what&amp;#39;s the point of radar</text><text start="595.03" dur="5.46">now what is the point of razor 7s what</text><text start="597.94" dur="5.25">is the point of radar well radar and</text><text start="600.49" dur="5.79">things like radar and radar can help us</text><text start="603.19" dur="5.55">know how our crazy are so we know that</text><text start="606.28" dur="4.38">we heard at least just as good as them</text><text start="608.74" dur="2.37">and later we are better than them yeah</text><text start="610.66" dur="2.04">yeah</text><text start="611.11" dur="3.29">so you know you finish your presentation</text><text start="612.7" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ll take questions at the end that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="614.4" dur="6.37">okay yeah so here&amp;#39;s one thing here&amp;#39;s one</text><text start="617.71" dur="5.66">thing the alien a project is about</text><text start="620.77" dur="6.09">releasing data right data for HD maps</text><text start="623.37" dur="6.73">data for HD maps is about knowing the</text><text start="626.86" dur="4.71">distance between objects in the camera</text><text start="630.1" dur="3.96">and also knowing the distance between</text><text start="631.57" dur="5.07">two views of the road so if you have</text><text start="634.06" dur="6.39">something like this like these are</text><text start="636.64" dur="6.81">different routes on that people driving</text><text start="640.45" dur="4.14">the car they are open pilot in different</text><text start="643.45" dur="3.39">days right</text><text start="644.59" dur="4.08">and then we know how close those images</text><text start="646.84" dur="3.6">are and then we try to match them how</text><text start="648.67" dur="4.62">far away is this camera from this camera</text><text start="650.44" dur="4.95">to this camera here&amp;#39;s one thing if you</text><text start="653.29" dur="4.62">guys want to make sure you&amp;#39;re part of</text><text start="655.39" dur="5.3">this data we introduce you a concept</text><text start="657.91" dur="4.55">called common raid which is about</text><text start="660.69" dur="5.26">several okoma</text><text start="662.46" dur="5.29">Ian&amp;#39;s driving on a single highway well</text><text start="665.95" dur="4.38">you don&amp;#39;t have times that I wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="667.75" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s way more exciting wait wait wait</text><text start="670.33" dur="4.23">but if you do something like this let us</text><text start="672.82" dur="3.9">know this is not mandatory we&amp;#39;ll figure</text><text start="674.56" dur="3.75">it out a way to do it without this but</text><text start="676.72" dur="4.05">if you want to make sure your data goes</text><text start="678.31" dur="4.62">into the ADA a project you want to get</text><text start="680.77" dur="3.84">your buddies in your common meetups and</text><text start="682.93" dur="5.46">drive together down the highway</text><text start="684.61" dur="5.94">preferably with a different ways and why</text><text start="688.39" dur="3.96">this is a thing because it&amp;#39;s this this</text><text start="690.55" dur="4.83">is the kind of images we are looking for</text><text start="692.35" dur="5.4">to build a date if you if you drive in</text><text start="695.38" dur="4.35">the same place with other people even</text><text start="697.75" dur="3.84">without using your pen pilot just even</text><text start="699.73" dur="3.78">with great panda you increase your</text><text start="701.59" dur="4.74">chances of going into this data set of</text><text start="703.51" dur="5.7">having this data in the big open data</text><text start="706.33" dur="4.71">set for for the world because then there</text><text start="709.21" dur="3.45">is no elimination problem right</text><text
