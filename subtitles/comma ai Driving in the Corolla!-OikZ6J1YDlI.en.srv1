start="1616.36" dur="9.03">to it that would be incredible oh okay</text><text start="1619.93" dur="7.59">so open pilot replaces ECU&amp;#39;s ECU&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1625.39" dur="4.32">communicate with each other over the</text><text start="1627.52" dur="3.99">canvas and they send canned messages to</text><text start="1629.71" dur="3.48">each other so when you tap in and you</text><text start="1631.51" dur="3.84">use like a panda and cabana you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1633.19" dur="4.8">seeing all the ECU is communicating with</text><text start="1635.35" dur="4.11">each other you can unplug an ECU and</text><text start="1637.99" dur="4.98">what you&amp;#39;ll find is that some messages</text><text start="1639.46" dur="6.3">stop being sent so what we do for the</text><text start="1642.97" dur="5.13">Toyota is we unplug this ECU this ECU is</text><text start="1645.76" dur="2.71">a camera and that lets us send the</text><text start="1648.1" dur="3.16">command</text><text start="1648.47" dur="4.5">to turn the wheel we also unplugged the</text><text start="1651.26" dur="3.99">driving support ECU to send the</text><text start="1652.97" dur="5.4">acceleration command but this is like</text><text start="1655.25" dur="4.53">replacing ECU&amp;#39;s a lot of the tutorials</text><text start="1658.37" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re gonna find on the internet for</text><text start="1659.78" dur="7.71">sending to the can bus are using this</text><text start="1662.99" dur="7.95">this is like ISO TP standard um with ISO</text><text start="1667.49" dur="5.549">TP you can there&amp;#39;s like an API which you</text><text start="1670.94" dur="4.17">can use to talk to different ECU&amp;#39;s this</text><text start="1673.039" dur="4.111">is not how easy use talk to each other</text><text start="1675.11" dur="5.4">so there&amp;#39;s kind of two desperate uses of</text><text start="1677.15" dur="5.49">the canvas

dur="3.24">safety thing and they declared this to</text><text start="1879.39" dur="2.67">be okay</text><text start="1880.14" dur="4.86">no I think they have are there</text><text start="1882.06" dur="5.25">limitations oh you mean like full talk</text><text start="1885" dur="4.14">yeah the main thing is the torque rate I</text><text start="1887.31" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t really think it&amp;#39;s like a full</text><text start="1889.14" dur="3.48">torque but do you think they consider it</text><text start="1890.94" dur="6.06">like anything you could send to the ECU</text><text start="1892.62" dur="6.39">to be like okay and cue em well I&amp;#39;m sure</text><text start="1897" dur="4.77">they have talked a the mutations we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1899.01" dur="3.9">in

than</text><text start="1904.59" dur="4.23">what I would consider safe yeah exactly</text><text start="1905.97" dur="6.87">me so right and obviously max torque is</text><text start="1908.82" dur="11.97">this much torque is okay it&amp;#39;s like 50</text><text start="1912.84" dur="9.33">feet per second we limit this safety</text><text start="1920.79" dur="3.99">even more in the Panda for
