dur="5.341">world and really what we want to</text><text start="264.65" dur="5.4">eliminate right dopamine release when</text><text start="268.19" dur="2.849">uncertain rewards yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="270.05" dur="2.009">of true and that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="271.039" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s kind of sketchy I&amp;#39;m sick of</text><text start="272.059" dur="3.57">wasting my time driving I mean yeah that</text><text start="274.249" dur="3.57">comes really back to the boredom factor</text><text start="275.629" dur="3.75">right but the idea that driving is a</text><text start="277.819" dur="5.1">waste of time really has to do with</text><text start="279.379" dur="6.361">boredom so I don&amp;#39;t know I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="282.919" dur="3.99">know about about about more exciting and</text><text start="285.74" dur="3.599">I shouldn&amp;#39;t put a line to anxiety</text><text start="286.909" dur="4.38">because we haven&amp;#39;t eliminated it yeah so</text><text start="289.339" dur="12.03">we will erase the line and we will come</text><text start="291.289"

dur="8.459">that but okay so boredom people want to</text><text start="312.949" dur="6.421">drive less hello just just now this is</text><text start="317.479" dur="4.41">this is the there&amp;#39;s lots of like this is</text><text start="319.37" dur="4.439">scenarios that are particularly boring</text><text start="321.889" dur="4.53">on long drives in the highway when</text><text start="323.809" dur="9.931">you&amp;#39;re not doing much remember like this</text><text start="326.419" dur="10.64">was great okay um yeah okay I mean I you</text><text start="333.74" dur="3.319">guys probably can&amp;#39;t see the board</text><text start="337.33" dur="4.149">anything for periscope yeah the front</text><text start="340.219" dur="4.051">camera okay you guys like the front</text><text start="341.479" dur="5.22">camera we can we can we can go here a</text><text start="344.27" dur="7.229">life swings like a pendulum backward and</text><text start="346.699" dur="8.911">forward between pain and boredom um okay</text><text start="351.499" dur="6.991">so how can driving be better we want to</text><text start="355.61" dur="4.739">people like the rant ones more the rant</text><text start="358.49" dur="4.44">ones get a lot more views this isn&amp;#39;t a</text><text start="360.349" dur="6.36">rant this is talking about improving the</text><text start="362.93" dur="6.479">world people um now see this is hard to</text><text start="366.709" dur="4.05">do like you can see me now but it&amp;#39;s hard</text><text start="369.409" dur="2.811">for me to hold the phone out here okay</text><text start="370.759" dur="5.641">let&amp;#39;s go</text><text start="372.22" dur="6.55">so so so let&amp;#39;s do you guys agree that</text><text start="376.4" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re so bored I&amp;#39;m gonna fix for bored</text><text start="378.77" dur="3.72">maybe we&amp;#39;ll do it like that like a fix</text><text start="381.05" dur="5.22">for boredom would be to make driving</text><text start="382.49" dur="7.16">more exciting and a fix for stress and</text><text start="386.27" dur="6.69">anxiety is basically reliable alerting</text><text start="389.65" dur="6.04">if you know I mean you might become</text><text start="392.96" dur="4.23">anxious about the alert but that has</text><text start="395.69" dur="3.45">more to do with how the alert is</text><text start="397.19" dur="3.72">designed but if the alert is like</text><text start="399.14" dur="2.88">something terrible might happen in ten</text><text start="400.91" dur="3.27">minutes and of course you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text><text start="402.02" dur="4.65">a stressful ten minutes right but if the</text><text start="404.18" dur="4.56">alert is you know literally in 15</text><text start="406.67" dur="3.54">seconds you know that guy&amp;#39;s looks like</text><text start="408.74" dur="3.48">he&amp;#39;s coming in too fast</text><text start="410.21" dur="4.56">just make sure you hit the brakes you do</text><text start="412.22" dur="5.88">this nobody tells you exactly what to do</text><text start="414.77" dur="5.85">and you&amp;#39;re good about that right this is</text><text start="418.1" dur="4.8">obviously well before we get to level</text><text start="420.62" dur="6.42">four or five because you know that stuff</text><text start="422.9" dur="6.12">is mostly it&amp;#39;s mostly figures most cars</text><text start="427.04" dur="3.69">not it&amp;#39;s not safer than people right</text><text start="429.02" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s not and they cheaper than people</text><text start="430.73" dur="5.61">but it&amp;#39;s not safe taking people plan</text><text start="433.34" dur="5.52">exchange responsibility of driving a I</text><text start="436.34" dur="4.05">drive for easy parts only make it</text><text start="438.86" dur="7.08">commitment I don&amp;#39;t really know what that</text><text start="440.39" dur="7.5">means so well the other solution is the</text><text start="445.94" dur="4.23">other solution instead of more exciting</text><text start="447.89" dur="5.4">to the boarding problem is something</text><text start="450.17" dur="6.26">else right like what if people could</text><text start="453.29" dur="11.64">just do something else</text><text start="456.43" dur="12.22">way in a solution to stress and anxiety</text><text start="464.93" dur="6.81">is reliable learning so now what would</text><text start="468.65" dur="4.95">it take well okay so more exciting can</text><text start="471.74" dur="5.94">just get worked on while driving right</text><text start="473.6" dur="5.85">so so maybe maybe um you know this is</text><text start="477.68" dur="2.46">more exciting you can do easily with</text><text start="479.45" dur="2.46">level two</text><text start="480.14" dur="3.15">alright you don&amp;#39;t need you just want to</text><text start="481.91" dur="2.73">make something more exciting you can you</text><text start="483.29" dur="4.35">can share ways and that&amp;#39;s effectively</text><text start="484.64" dur="4.77">you think of ways driving a system right</text><text start="487.64" dur="4.17">we don&amp;#39;t think of ourselves is really</text><text start="489.41" dur="4.29">that different from from ways yeah naps</text><text start="491.81" dur="4.14">fall in the realm of something else</text><text start="493.7" dur="4.08">so that would be level three level three</text><text start="495.95" dur="2.489">is you know when the car gives you</text><text start="497.78" dur="2.849">enough of</text><text start="498.439" dur="4.08">warning to my waking up for a nap is</text><text start="500.629" dur="4.231">kind of odd it&amp;#39;s kind of yeah Charlotte</text><text
