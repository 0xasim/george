write in</text><text start="125.22" dur="9.78">functionalities where the car is driving</text><text start="129.99" dur="13.76">so similar to what the peyote and so</text><text start="135" dur="11.25">right now the device that you see and</text><text start="143.75" dur="4.989">this is what right now the only devices</text><text start="146.25" dur="4.86">possible pilot but we are very opened</text><text start="148.739" dur="4.081">and like more and more devices that</text><text start="151.11" dur="3.629">actually could support the support of a</text><text start="152.82" dur="3.27">part which is one main reason why we</text><text start="154.739" dur="3.601">move the pilot of this sort so that</text><text start="156.09" dur="4.79">people can actually port it they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="158.34" dur="2.54">aware</text><text start="163.43" dur="5.71">we have any plans to use that or did you</text><text start="166.29" dur="4.35">actually use any simulation when you do</text><text start="169.14" dur="4.83">that with payment system or is it all on</text><text start="170.64" dur="5.28">life days we might know we do we do is</text><text start="173.97" dur="4.71">already simulator so we do use</text><text start="175.92" dur="4.35">simulators to plan regression tests to</text><text start="178.68" dur="4.62">develop our features it was like we have</text><text start="180.27" dur="4.92">to use simulators so my cartoon again we</text><text start="183.3" dur="3.18">extensively use simulators but the</text><text start="185.19" dur="3.18">interesting simulators that we are</text><text start="186.48" dur="4.02">building is the simulator that we hope</text><text start="188.37" dur="5.85">is gonna allow us a flying personal</text><text start="190.5" dur="5.43">learning to try this is kind of a</text><text start="194.22" dur="3.45">different simulator that requires us</text><text start="195.93" dur="5.82">having like a very good understanding of</text><text start="197.67" dur="5.1">the surrounding and then creating a</text><text start="201.75" dur="2.79">system where the car can be</text><text start="202.77" dur="5.1">automatically rewarded if he drives well</text><text start="204.54" dur="4.47">and being like the same honest when he</text><text start="207.87" dur="2.76">doesn&amp;#39;t drive well automatically</text><text start="209.01" dur="3.24">understanding how to drive this is like</text><text start="210.63" dur="5.1">one of the research projects that we are</text><text start="212.25" dur="6.78">working on which allows us to add like</text><text start="215.73" dur="4.86">other models more scaling and having</text><text start="219.03" dur="3.87">more leverage of the data that we have</text><text start="220.59" dur="4.59">without having to work all the features</text><text start="222.9" dur="4.38">for planning so it&amp;#39;s some sort of like</text><text start="225.18" dur="4.05">how do we copy apply machine learning to</text><text start="227.28" dur="5.28">the block if it does like the planning</text><text start="229.23" dur="6.65">of the Sodra here and so this is what</text><text start="232.56" dur="3.32">like simulated everything</text><text start="250.08" dur="5.799">can you select the particle of</text><text start="252.129" dur="5.311">communication in SoCal&amp;#39;s like a</text><text start="255.879" dur="3.031">different light it&amp;#39;s use the way that</text><text start="257.44" dur="3.75">these issues communicate with each other</text><text start="258.91" dur="3.479">is true and is a and protocol which is</text><text start="261.19" dur="13.41">they are coming up communication area</text><text start="262.389" dur="15.601">network I mean my hand itself is off the</text><text start="274.6" dur="5.73">network like you can&amp;#39;t like any as I can</text><text start="277.99" dur="3.989">as can portable communication seems like</text><text start="280.33" dur="4.2">many years it&amp;#39;s actually mandatory to</text><text start="281.979" dur="4.801">use to your scanner since I think the</text><text start="284.53" dur="3.87">eight is so now I mean you have to have</text><text start="286.78" dur="5.669">physical access to the car in order to</text><text start="288.4" dur="7.44">have like any sort of like issues like</text><text start="292.449" dur="5.731">issues like devices that are connected</text><text start="295.84" dur="3.99">on internet and yes you have to be you</text><text start="298.18" dur="4.14">have to make sure that you cannot ever</text><text start="299.83" dur="10.8">you are going to have a tax through the</text><text start="302.32" dur="10.469">internet connectivity of your device yes</text><text start="310.63" dur="6.24">our device is interconnected and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="312.789" dur="5.791">how we yeah you know the same thing</text><text start="316.87" dur="4.14">basically that like the same processes</text><text start="318.58" dur="3.899">but like many many many many cars like</text><text start="321.01" dur="3.36">software software like on the same</text><text start="322.479" dur="4.171">problem as before we&amp;#39;re gonna see more</text><text start="324.37" dur="4.56">and more cars having capability of being</text><text start="326.65" dur="3.63">like updated over yeah right this is the</text><text start="328.93" dur="3.419">kind of thing that we believe it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="330.28" dur="3.569">absolutely so it&amp;#39;s kind of like we</text><text start="332.349" dur="4.921">believe is like super strange they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="333.849" dur="5.971">like $30,000 object that you buy today</text><text start="337.27" dur="7.32">cannot be updated over yeah like if you</text><text start="339.82" dur="6.24">need a software update and regarding</text><text start="344.59" dur="3.299">like safety yes I mean of course it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="346.06" dur="5.16">our concern right but like how many cars</text><text start="347.889" dur="5.131">have been act in the last like how many</text><text start="351.22" dur="3.87">classic you or they have been hacked and</text><text start="353.02" dur="4.22">they made some damage because they be</text><text start="355.09" dur="2.15">not</text><text start="357.34" dur="19.05">I had heard about about one so it is a</text><text start="359.98" dur="20.1">concern clarify what she said earlier</text><text start="376.39" dur="7.13">about reading the censors so if there</text><text start="380.08" dur="7.05">whatever sensor suite is in place for a</text><text start="383.52" dur="7.77">task that comes are you&amp;#39;re able to use</text><text start="387.13" dur="7.77">those sensors and incorporated into</text><text start="391.29" dur="5.11">quick and then towards the answer you</text><text start="394.9" dur="3.3">were saying about items that are</text><text start="396.4" dur="3.75">available for purchase you mentioned</text><text start="398.2" dur="5.03">something about if you wanted to know</text><text start="400.15" dur="7.22">more about positioning of your vehicle</text><text start="403.23" dur="8.29">what how precise is what is it</text><text start="407.37" dur="6.25">so do you some lousy oh so it&amp;#39;s like so</text><text start="411.52" dur="4.23">this is like you blocks I&amp;#39;m not sure if</text><text start="413.62" dur="3.9">you are familiar with this use like a</text><text start="415.75" dur="3.51">new blocks processing antenna</text><text start="417.52" dur="7.23">wherever you have access actually to all</text><text start="419.26" dur="7.56">GPS and so thought about like how much</text><text start="424.75" dur="3.93">post processing you do about it and you</text><text start="426.82" dur="4.8">can get like very precise that you can</text><text start="428.68" dur="6.47">actually like you use the correct like</text><text start="431.62" dur="5.97">post processing and so in this regard</text><text start="435.15" dur="6.85">okay this is like a little spoiler but</text><text start="437.59" dur="6.81">this week we&amp;#39;re gonna release idea here</text><text start="442" dur="4.68">so this week we&amp;#39;re kind of like there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="444.4" dur="4.62">an engineer like our health organization</text><text start="446.68" dur="6.87">who is actually going to going to make</text><text start="449.02" dur="7.11">an open source of post processor or GPS</text><text start="453.55" dur="4.41">data and get like the best across it is</text><text start="456.13" dur="4.89">you can get the type of response team I</text><text start="457.96" dur="4.95">mean like so no micro GPS as opposed to</text><text start="461.02" dur="6.93">regular</text><text start="462.91" dur="7.71">the difference Thank You procedure yeah</text><text start="467.95" dur="4.77">well so we do the post-processing not</text><text start="470.62" dur="3.69">assuming that you do like any vision</text><text start="472.72" dur="4.32">feature magic which allows you to be</text><text start="474.31" dur="4.89">even way more precise so just by GPS</text><text start="477.04" dur="3.63">a-gps processing and some sort of light</text><text start="479.2" dur="4.08">filter like you&amp;#39;re playing a Kalman</text><text start="480.67" dur="4.71">filter and you&amp;#39;re like sense of a like</text><text start="483.28" dur="12.3">accelerometer you can get between like</text><text start="485.38" dur="13.32">helping me there procedure well you</text><text start="495.58" dur="4.59">would be able to localize all but if you</text><text start="498.7" dur="3.81">have the map that you can centimeter</text><text start="500.17" dur="4.26">across because once you know which lane</text><text start="502.51" dur="3.99">you are into then you just have to find</text><text start="504.43" dur="3.96">like some visual feature like line lines</text><text start="506.5" dur="3.48">and localize yourself within very are</text><text start="508.39" dur="5.25">totally within centimeter within the</text><text start="509.98" dur="5.52">lane lines so yes I mean this is not</text><text start="513.64" dur="3.48">assuming any visual organization if you</text><text start="515.5" dur="3.539">want to use visualization then you can</text><text start="517.12" dur="3.57">get like centimeter accurate because for</text><text start="519.039" dur="4.44">example I necessarily you know which</text><text start="520.69" dur="5.07">lane which lane you are into you see</text><text start="523.479" dur="4.141">where the lane lane lines are and then</text><text start="525.76" dur="3.24">you just localized yourself relatively</text><text start="527.62" dur="3.09">to the main lines for which you</text><text start="529" dur="4.05">perfectly know the position because they</text><text start="530.71" dur="4.11">are on your high-definition maps and</text><text start="533.05" dur="3.48">then you can organize yourself at least</text><text start="534.82" dur="5.76">in one dimension which is dimension that</text><text start="536.53" dur="6.18">matters within like Yousaf meter how</text><text start="540.58" dur="4.88">much is it obviously like subtyping to</text><text start="542.71" dur="2.75">me that I really like</text><text start="551.1" dur="5.33">[Music]</text><text start="553.15" dur="4.72">but I&amp;#39;m funny that I&amp;#39;ll commute that we</text><text start="556.43" dur="3.12">post-processing yes we&amp;#39;re gonna lose the</text><text start="557.87" dur="3.21">tools do I should achieve that and this</text><text start="559.55" dur="6.38">is all every all the software that goes</text><text start="561.08" dur="4.85">into a source yes</text><text start="584.18" dur="8.08">oops sorry we have our Canadian crew</text><text start="589.17"

dur="48.99">I think stay the hardware yeah any</text><text start="1049.88" dur="3.89">thought that might be enough but if it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1052.01" dur="9.5">not they&amp;#39;re gonna replace the hardware</text><text start="1053.77" dur="7.74">is that still kind of industry</text><text start="1126.37" dur="11.47">with sooner the thing is something today</text><text start="1133.7" dur="8.02">whether it&amp;#39;s writing applications when</text><text start="1137.84" dur="19.21">the machine learns it creates a solution</text><text start="1141.72" dur="15.33">you are you are

dur="3.87">I was busy - yelling at bachelor and</text><text start="1254.51" dur="3.69">then I switched to automotive mechanical</text><text start="1256.16" dur="5.13">engineers for master I moved to United</text><text start="1258.2" dur="5.94">States I need some work in the vehicle</text><text start="1261.29" dur="7.86">so I moved to Tesla Tesla for about like</text><text start="1264.14" dur="10.77">five six years and the pilot then I</text><text start="1269.15" dur="8.01">joined I met George which there is the</text><text start="1274.91" dur="7.08">founder combi and I got very excited</text><text start="1277.16" dur="8.1">about the project and I&amp;#39;m still happy so</text><text start="1281.99" dur="5.43">I&amp;#39;m very excited about like the idea of</text><text start="1285.26" dur="3.84">like solving practical problems like SCU</text><text start="1287.42" dur="3.39">job I get excited about problems where</text><text start="1289.1" dur="4.98">is it a huge opportunity of like making</text><text start="1290.81" dur="6.09">things better and I just see like a huge</text><text start="1294.08" dur="5.46">proportion of like investment other</text><text start="1296.9" dur="5.37">sources like overnight level 4 I just</text><text start="1299.54" dur="4.5">feel like okay well let&amp;#39;s picture like</text><text start="1302.27" dur="5.01">let me chew Stephanie like over a loop</text><text start="1304.04" dur="6.42">and so I&amp;#39;m excited about solving</text><text start="1307.28" dur="6.17">problems divide like positive actually</text><text start="1310.46" dur="2.99">impact on people&amp;#39;s life</text><text start="1317.159" dur="7.291">I understand thing there&amp;#39;s issues of</text><text start="1321.539" dur="5.19">propriety this about people&amp;#39;s are so</text><text start="1324.45" dur="6.829">currently and replace any money</text><text start="1326.729" dur="8.7">OS in most us jurisdictions in the world</text><text start="1331.279" dur="10.301">you invalidate warranty do you have</text><text start="1335.429" dur="8.791">plans to so obviously I said before like</text><text start="1341.58" dur="4.11">our our plan is to work with it is to</text><text start="1344.22" dur="2.669">work with humans player we have to work</text><text start="1345.69" dur="3.51">together like in order to make apparel</text><text start="1346.889" dur="4.321">successful we need to ship it like we</text><text start="1349.2" dur="3.929">need to work together to yes and so yeah</text><text start="1351.21" dur="3.419">this is the plan like the plan is like</text><text start="1353.129" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s not in part in anything like the</text><text start="1354.629" dur="4.441">work with aftermarket product it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1357.45" dur="3.569">actually working working with them and</text><text start="1359.07" dur="3.359">working together like exchanging</text><text start="1361.019" dur="4.53">information about like how there are the</text><text start="1362.429" dur="4.141">interface of the cap works and making it</text><text start="1365.549" dur="12.541">compatible like what I&amp;#39;m saying</text><text start="1366.57" dur="13.529">compatible at the point like they do</text><text start="1378.09" dur="3.659">with the polar project they&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="1380.099" dur="3.54">do the same thing I think like their</text><text start="1381.749" dur="4.321">approach is the totally different from</text><text start="1383.639" dur="6.061">us we try to make it working on tasks</text><text start="1386.07" dur="4.979">that people own which is why like we</text><text start="1389.7" dur="2.939">want to make it accessible right we want</text><text start="1391.049" dur="5.07">to make like open pilots something that</text><text start="1392.639" dur="6.24">people can access and so we to like</text><text start="1396.119" dur="4.23">definitely try to achieve our end goal</text><text start="1398.879" dur="3.691">but the way that we&amp;#39;re doing is very</text><text start="1400.349" dur="4.41">different like we try to make it open</text><text start="1402.57" dur="4.14">pilot working on to the ACE car there</text><text start="1404.759" dur="4.92">try to make a map I like they are polar</text><text start="1406.71" dur="5.519">projects working on we with cars that</text><text start="1409.679" dur="6.541">cost more than $1,000 and just research</text><text start="1412.229" dur="6.091">projects and so they&amp;#39;re like and it only</text><text start="1416.22" dur="5.309">works on like very heavy computers like</text><text start="1418.32" dur="5.669">we use by consumer we use things that</text><text start="1421.529" dur="4.2">you can find in focus liking the smart</text><text start="1423.989" dur="5.37">phones you can buy today is they argue</text><text start="1425.729" dur="5.16">that is sufficient to run a pilot so the</text><text start="1429.359" dur="3.391">direction is very different we try to</text><text start="1430.889" dur="5.641">value like accessibility</text><text start="1432.75" dur="6.87">and orally like transparency and early</text><text start="1436.53" dur="4.74">adoptability of the features while while</text><text start="1439.62" dur="3.809">I think Apple is taking more like and</text><text start="1441.27" dur="6.48">testifying like something that means</text><text start="1443.429" dur="5.911">like very heavy they basically didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1447.75" dur="4.289">consider like any constraints in term of</text><text start="1449.34" dur="6.99">like a car accessibility and so the part</text><text start="1452.039" dur="6.421">to get there is different we have seven</text><text start="1456.33" dur="3.75">million miles we plan 12 like people</text><text start="1458.46" dur="5.07">live in a year they said like more than</text><text start="1460.08" dur="5.31">100 ma and 100 medium eyes I don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="1463.53" dur="3.48">like the polar project is ever gonna get</text><text start="1465.39" dur="5.25">close to that like Apple is now gonna be</text><text start="1467.01" dur="5.01">able to define their own HD maps on</text><text start="1470.64" dur="3.69">different the day today their devices</text><text start="1472.02" dur="19.11">collect because the amount of people</text><text start="1474.33" dur="19.29">using their devices is it&amp;#39;s possible</text><text start="1491.13" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s possible but like I mean okay so</text><text start="1493.62" dur="4.71">which which which hardware do they need</text><text start="1495.72" dur="4.589">that do they need like they need like</text><text start="1498.33" dur="5.16">lighter so do they need which I mean</text><text start="1500.309" dur="6.421">like I have not seen like a car driving</text><text start="1503.49"
