self-driving</text><text start="14.77" dur="6.09">car industry so as part of this is kind</text><text start="19.06" dur="4.41">of gonna be my industry commentary I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="20.86" dur="5.46">been spending the morning watching some</text><text start="23.47" dur="5.899">of our competitors videos and I&amp;#39;ll give</text><text start="26.32" dur="6.239">you kind of what my thoughts are on them</text><text start="29.369" dur="6.391">so maybe we&amp;#39;ll start with this one so</text><text start="32.559" dur="3.201">this is the mole</text><text start="36.32" dur="5.079">lacking sleep not something the</text><text start="38.489" dur="5.601">last-minute good morning so this is the</text><text start="41.399" dur="4.951">mobile like you know terms of my music I</text><text start="44.09" dur="10.48">try to watch all these things will fix</text><text start="46.35" dur="13.86">better I do so mobile actually is one of</text><text start="54.57" dur="9.239">the least high P players in the game no</text><text start="60.21" dur="5.909">no I co always actually one of the least</text><text start="63.809" dur="4.381">hyping players in the game they had</text><text start="66.119" dur="5.511">noticed a few interesting things in this</text><text start="68.19" dur="7.819">in this presentation I&amp;#39;m so first off</text><text start="71.63" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;re going back to the after market</text><text start="76.85" dur="5.29">they have this thing called the mobile I</text><text start="79.05" dur="4.56">connect 8 and it looks suspiciously like</text><text start="82.14" dur="8.31">a neon you&amp;#39;re like a ram in the</text><text start="83.61" dur="9.509">aftermarket why you don&amp;#39;t program it I</text><text start="90.45" dur="4.589">do a lot of programming so yeah this is</text><text start="93.119" dur="3.691">this is an interesting play for mobile I</text><text start="95.039" dur="4.47">like there they&amp;#39;re selling an</text><text start="96.81" dur="3.839">aftermarket thing to fleets so if you</text><text start="99.509" dur="6.951">guys don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s a company called</text><text start="100.649" dur="9.691">nada which is doing something similar so</text><text start="106.46" dur="6.22">no no builds this little camera thing I</text><text start="110.34" dur="3.809">believe it has a Snapdragon 820 in it we</text><text start="112.68" dur="3">can push them out and it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text><text start="114.149" dur="5.371">a cloud based dash cam really very</text><text start="115.68" dur="6.24">similar to ours I met with them at CES</text><text start="119.52" dur="5.48">last year I visited that little booth</text><text start="121.92" dur="7.02">man she spoke with Gabby Holsworth</text><text start="125" dur="6.37">Travis khalaq Nick&amp;#39;s ex-girlfriend so</text><text start="128.94" dur="4.23">that was kind of interesting but yeah so</text><text start="131.37" dur="4.649">let&amp;#39;s go back to this mobile I also</text><text start="133.17" dur="6.27">announced me to be honest</text><text start="136.019" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re 2018 plans look very similar to</text><text start="139.44" dur="5.389">ours and I don&amp;#39;t know if I should be</text><text start="141.54" dur="8.06">happy about this or concerned by this</text><text start="144.829" dur="7.011">but they talked about level 2 plus</text><text start="149.6" dur="5.06">really</text><text start="151.84" dur="6.42">so they show on the left side there</text><text start="154.66" dur="5.579">showing map so these these lanes here</text><text start="158.26" dur="4.11">coming from the map and these lanes are</text><text start="160.239" dur="3.511">coming from sensing I&amp;#39;m so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text><text start="162.37" dur="4.17">roll out pretty much the exact same</text><text start="163.75" dur="4.53">thing we&amp;#39;re gonna have our own comment i</text><text start="166.54" dur="5.19">HD maps which we&amp;#39;re gonna open source</text><text start="168.28" dur="4.89">before the end of the year and they&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="171.73" dur="3">have they&amp;#39;ll have telev lanes and</text><text start="173.17" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not have features to do precise</text><text start="174.73" dur="5.13">localization and then kind of you know</text><text start="176.98" dur="5.009">where to drive from the map so mobile is</text><text start="179.86" dur="3.57">calling this level 2 plus they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="181.989" dur="5.28">talking about doing traffic lights in</text><text start="183.43" dur="5.79">the exact same way we are about as a as</text><text start="187.269" dur="3.391">a quote where he literally says but the</text><text start="189.22" dur="3.69">hard part is not detecting the traffic</text><text start="190.66" dur="4.56">light the hard part is figuring out what</text><text start="192.91" dur="10.409">traffic lights apply to you and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="195.22" dur="13.62">of course true so yeah there&amp;#39;s that now</text><text start="203.319" dur="10.771">I can&amp;#39;t find a better video for lip lift</text><text start="208.84" dur="8.55">inactive so first off to understand</text><text start="214.09" dur="5.67">active used to be Delfy so they&amp;#39;ve kind</text><text start="217.39" dur="4.68">of rebranded their self-driving division</text><text start="219.76" dur="5.61">in the same way Google we branded their</text><text start="222.07" dur="6.21">self-driving division as way mo um so</text><text start="225.37" dur="4.679">lift and active bring Robo taxis to CES</text><text start="228.28" dur="5.64">and a lot of companies have announced</text><text start="230.049" dur="7.741">partnerships with lyft the truth about</text><text start="233.92" dur="5.939">these partnerships is my understanding</text><text start="237.79" dur="4.62">is like there&amp;#39;s no lift technology being</text><text start="239.859" dur="4.321">used basically whenever someone</text><text start="242.41" dur="3.15">announces a partnership with lyft all</text><text start="244.18" dur="4.17">that means is that they&amp;#39;re putting their</text><text start="245.56" dur="5.429">cars on the lift network effectively</text><text start="248.35" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re signing up their autonomous cars</text><text start="250.989" dur="4.981">with safety drivers to be lyft drivers</text><text start="253.9" dur="4.29">you know we have this obviously no</text><text start="255.97" dur="4.109">partnership we have quite a few people</text><text start="258.19" dur="4.47">with with with open pilot driving for</text><text start="260.079" dur="4.441">driving on the lyft and uber networks so</text><text start="262.66" dur="4.069">I&amp;#39;m important to be clear about what</text><text start="264.52" dur="2.209">that</text><text start="267.11" dur="7.27">so let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s going on here that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="272.49" dur="4.5">not the car I&amp;#39;ve seen them have before</text><text start="274.38" dur="10.92">before they used to have like SUV like</text><text start="276.99" dur="11.929">things some BMW interesting they always</text><text start="285.3" dur="8.81">focus on experience I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure</text><text start="288.919" dur="5.191">why this is view as the difficult part</text><text start="294.919" dur="5.051">so what Delfy had last year was lied</text><text start="297.84" dur="3.84">hours around that car I think it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="299.97" dur="3.33">pretty much the same thing what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="301.68" dur="3.81">important to look at is their displays</text><text start="303.3" dur="4.83">because if they have any display at all</text><text start="305.49" dur="5.09">you can glean a whole lot of subtle so</text><text start="308.13" dur="6.12">let&amp;#39;s see what this is here we have a</text><text start="310.58" dur="5.38">dog looks like a fella named puck and</text><text start="314.25" dur="3.12">then we have a camera there and they</text><text start="315.96" dur="2.989">probably have a radar in there as well</text><text start="317.37" dur="4.289">that you can&amp;#39;t see behind the plastic</text><text start="318.949" dur="6.161">know about the autopilot Alexa so here&amp;#39;s</text><text start="321.659" dur="4.5">another puck in the I think that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="325.11" dur="3.899">puck I mean I guess it could be a</text><text start="326.159" dur="8.331">different lighter I don&amp;#39;t know okay</text><text start="329.009" dur="9.571">let&amp;#39;s so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s break this down so</text><text start="334.49" dur="6.94">it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text><text start="338.58" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve kind of no crowd source those</text><text start="341.43" dur="4.41">lane things this looks very similar to</text><text start="343.08" dur="5.639">the display that that Delfy showed last</text><text start="345.84" dur="4.71">time they clearly have a lidar in the</text><text start="348.719" dur="4.26">car because these dots here are coming</text><text start="350.55" dur="3.98">from the lidar see that these dots on</text><text start="352.979" dur="4.111">the back of the car from the lidar</text><text start="354.53" dur="5.139">they&amp;#39;re tracking their lead car very</text><text start="357.09" dur="5.25">explicitly they have a traffic light</text><text start="359.669" dur="5.131">here it&amp;#39;s not connection to other cars I</text><text start="362.34" dur="5.79">promise you it&amp;#39;s not that actually as</text><text start="364.8" dur="5.79">far as like actual demos go Delfy active</text><text start="368.13" dur="9.68">shows prettily the most impressive one</text><text start="370.59" dur="7.22">at CES turn the phone</text><text start="380.129" dur="5.171">so the experience doesn&amp;#39;t matter this is</text><text start="382.93" dur="5.579">what&amp;#39;s interesting they have this thing</text><text start="385.3" dur="5.19">up here called called manual I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="388.509" dur="3.75">sure how much I can I can say about this</text><text start="390.49" dur="4.01">cuz I have actually been for a ride in</text><text start="392.259" dur="2.241">this car</text><text start="402" dur="6.68">it&amp;#39;s interesting that they&amp;#39;ve switched</text><text start="403.5" dur="5.18">to BMWs - that must be because of the</text><text start="409.1" dur="9.61">why are they do I have orientation lock</text><text start="414.9" dur="5.85">then I turn it off but yeah so any any</text><text start="418.71" dur="5.07">more things people saw it - yes that we</text><text start="420.75" dur="6.65">kind of want to break down its kind of</text><text start="423.78" dur="6.18">just a chill I don&amp;#39;t have that much um</text><text start="427.4" dur="6.88">behavioral cloning doesn&amp;#39;t work but we</text><text start="429.96" dur="6.54">have a solution to it I&amp;#39;m not gonna go</text><text start="434.28" dur="4.53">too much into the details of that but if</text><text start="436.5" dur="4.41">the new models work the new models are</text><text start="438.81" dur="3.84">gonna be insanely good because they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="440.91" dur="2.79">not gonna require much automatic</text><text start="442.65" dur="2.37">ground-truthing at all</text><text start="443.7" dur="3.33">maybe the automatic ground truth or is</text><text start="445.02" dur="3.99">much simpler which a lot of the bugs</text><text start="447.03" dur="4.05">that exists an open pilot we&amp;#39;re at like</text><text start="449.01" dur="5.79">drifts out of a lane their bugs in the</text><text start="451.08" dur="5.58">automatic ground truth are so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="454.8" dur="3.66">check out let&amp;#39;s check out AI motive I</text><text start="456.66" dur="2.91">wrote in their car last year at CES they</text><text start="458.46" dur="2.37">don&amp;#39;t have any sort of nd eyes with up</text><text start="459.57" dur="3.09">or anything so we can we can say</text><text start="460.83" dur="3.84">whatever we want about them I generally</text><text start="462.66" dur="11.4">like AI motive look I&amp;#39;m being nice to</text><text start="464.67" dur="11.43">people in this periscope yes 20 20 18</text><text start="474.06" dur="3.45">I&amp;#39;d if I know has any companies they</text><text start="476.1" dur="6.2">want to shout out in the comments will</text><text start="477.51" dur="11.79">kind of go through them on will showcase</text><text start="482.3" dur="8.74">progress this is useless videos videos</text><text start="489.3" dur="2.31">no that was last year different was oh</text><text start="491.04" dur="3.15">here we go</text><text start="491.61" dur="4.11">a motive at CES day one so this is the</text><text start="494.19" dur="2.76">first time I&amp;#39;ve seen it yeah they had</text><text start="495.72" dur="3.74">the same stand last year it&amp;#39;s pretty</text><text start="496.95" dur="2.51">nice stand</text><text start="499.52" dur="5.819">[Music]</text><text start="501.969" dur="5.5">show me an actual demo um we can also</text><text start="505.339" dur="7.62">break down if you guys haven&amp;#39;t watched</text><text start="507.469" dur="8.82">the the Nvidia event the Nvidia event is</text><text start="512.959" dur="4.58">is interesting as well see what is this</text><text start="516.289" dur="8.311">video</text><text start="517.539" dur="9.91">this is alt so and videos announcing</text><text start="524.6" dur="9.15">these new these new these new hardware</text><text start="527.449" dur="8.731">things now my view on it basically is</text><text start="533.75" dur="4.829">kind of like why it&amp;#39;s in pretty you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="536.18" dur="7.099">gonna win well the thing about Nvidia is</text><text start="538.579" dur="7.831">they&amp;#39;re just not going to lose everybody</text><text start="543.279" dur="5.29">every same car manufacturer right now</text><text start="546.41" dur="3.989">should be buying and videos latest</text><text start="548.569" dur="4.291">hardware sticking it in their car and</text><text start="550.399" dur="4.11">making sure they can ot hang it it seems</text><text start="552.86" dur="3.93">like Tesla&amp;#39;s the only one actually smart</text><text start="554.509" dur="6.75">enough to do this but when you look at</text><text start="556.79" dur="5.97">these things that Nvidia has okay so</text><text start="561.259" dur="3.661">first off they show it they show a demo</text><text start="562.76" dur="13.8">of a car driving they show a seven-mile</text><text start="564.92" dur="14.219">Drive demo but they did show a demo good</text><text start="576.56" dur="4.019">morning we&amp;#39;re just going through it</text><text start="579.139" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re going we&amp;#39;re busting high puts</text><text start="580.579" dur="8.581">Kofi&amp;#39;s yeah okay so they do this they do</text><text start="585.889" dur="5.51">this eight mile autonomous route to New</text><text start="589.16" dur="5.46">Jersey the hormone is not too expensive</text><text start="591.399" dur="5.44">unless you&amp;#39;re an auto manufacturer it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="594.62" dur="3.81">just kind of useless like there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="596.839" dur="3.901">reason that you&amp;#39;re better off using</text><text start="598.43" dur="5.519">Nvidia&amp;#39;s dedicated hardware overusing</text><text start="600.74" dur="5.88">like a computer with an NVIDIA GPU well</text><text start="603.949" dur="4.471">Wilhite busting let&amp;#39;s go peace um so</text><text start="606.62" dur="8.13">they have this eight mile autonomous</text><text start="608.42" dur="7.95">route we were looking at what it&amp;#39;s they</text><text start="614.75" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t really show it they show it</text><text start="616.37" dur="4.199">running on like their little thing to my</text><text start="618.05" dur="6.659">guess is it&amp;#39;s highly localization based</text><text start="620.569" dur="6.601">and then they probably have like it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="624.709" dur="4.471">probably all localization Tom and then</text><text start="627.17" dur="2.8">you can just use any sort of like

start="675.399" dur="5.13">look at this this like on the screen</text><text start="677.8" dur="4.38">display right yeah they also I love when</text><text start="680.529" dur="3.901">they do this they didn&amp;#39;t blur out their</text><text start="682.18" dur="6.27">screen so the screen is actually down</text><text start="684.43" dur="5.24">here so it is running on drive works um</text><text

Lane that</text><text start="697.36" dur="4.919">line is very smooth I really doubt that</text><text start="699.91" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s coming from vision I think it has</text><text

start="720.97" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s not even in the visual scene like</text><text start="723.339" dur="4.971">this is how you can bust drive that AI</text><text start="724.87" dur="3.44">video is appallingly bad</text><text start="729.689" dur="6.49">so they&amp;#39;re driving here I&amp;#39;ve got a</text><text start="734.35" dur="3.389">little inch forward at the stop sign and</text><text start="736.179" dur="3.6">people think oh that&amp;#39;s tricky behavior</text><text start="737.739" dur="4.38">no it&amp;#39;s just hard coded and like this</text><text start="739.779" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;d like the demo route that they do</text><text start="742.119" dur="4.111">and then they they localize they</text><text start="744.429" dur="6.27">probably use a bit of vision to localize</text><text start="746.23" dur="6.389">- I don&amp;#39;t see Lars on the car so the way</text><text start="750.699" dur="13.13">companies like crews are doing it is</text><text
