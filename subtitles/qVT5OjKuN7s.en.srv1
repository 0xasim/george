dur="5.279">one of the metrics that can be used is</text><text start="217.01" dur="4.74">disengagement so then if you go in this</text><text start="219.709" dur="4.53">video they talked about you know what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="221.75" dur="4.08">actually going on in the zukes car and</text><text start="224.239" dur="3.241">they go for a drive back to the office</text><text start="225.83"

dur="6.06">old comments what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s missing from</text><text start="251.87" dur="5.67">this picture that you might see in any</text><text start="253.94" dur="6.139">other car a steering wheel right so</text><text start="257.54" dur="6.3">notice the way that this shot is frames</text><text start="260.079" dur="5.741">so Wow look Suk&amp;#39;s has a car without a</text><text start="263.84" dur="3.63">steering wheel right and that&amp;#39;s what you</text><text start="265.82" dur="5.659">think if you&amp;#39;re just glancing over this</text><text start="267.47" dur="6.24">video but that&amp;#39;s the backseat of the car</text><text start="271.479" dur="3.701">guess what&amp;#39;s in the front seat of the</text><text start="273.71" dur="6.36">car and we&amp;#39;ll get a shot of them in a</text><text start="275.18" dur="11.34">minute look at you didn&amp;#39;t see that guy</text><text start="280.07" dur="13.14">anywhere else look at that guy who says</text><text start="286.52" dur="11.22">how come we didn&amp;#39;t get introduced right</text><text start="293.21" dur="8.88">so the video unfortunately is not really</text><text start="297.74" dur="6.12">an unedited um unedited thing oh we can</text><text start="302.09" dur="4.02">go over here to this is this is a video</text><text start="303.86" dur="5.07">that Cruz Automation released and it</text><text start="306.11" dur="5.4">actually is an unedited video of a drive</text><text start="308.93" dur="4.169">throughout City to San Francisco um and</text><text start="311.51" dur="3.39">they show you look here&amp;#39;s the safety</text><text start="313.099" dur="3.091">driver here&amp;#39;s the safety driver you know</text><text start="314.9" dur="3.389">with their hands a safe distance from</text><text start="316.19" dur="3.39">the wheel but not touching it okay they</text><text start="318.289" dur="5.341">have a little gimmicky thing that says</text><text start="319.58" dur="9.47">autonomous but this is a real video this</text><text start="323.63" dur="8.94">is an impressive technology demo um this</text><text start="329.05" dur="7.02">is hype right and you know what car a</text><text start="332.57" dur="3.5">guy we do love hype now</text><text start="339.36" dur="5.17">you guys man look at the symmetry of the</text><text start="343.12" dur="3.96">yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind a chauffeur either</text><text start="344.53" dur="4.5">what are they cost I&amp;#39;m okay so you know</text><text start="347.08" dur="5.78">if he hears it cut across the things</text><text start="349.03" dur="6.6">tracking the trough that&amp;#39;s all great um</text><text start="352.86" dur="4.21">so the only thing that I could really</text><text start="355.63" dur="3">nitpick do you guys remember the drive</text><text start="357.07" dur="3.48">that AI video the line following robot</text><text start="358.63" dur="6.48">that that one was bad</text><text start="360.55" dur="7.32">um this was the only thing that I could</text><text start="365.11" dur="5.28">really nitpick that I think is probably</text><text start="367.87" dur="4.35">a disengagement right they don&amp;#39;t tell</text><text start="370.39" dur="4.26">you whether there were disengagement syn</text><text start="372.22" dur="5.55">the drive mean again they&amp;#39;re sitting in</text><text start="374.65" dur="5.07">the backseat you can&amp;#39;t tell whether that</text><text start="377.77" dur="3.33">driver is casually pressing on the brake</text><text start="379.72" dur="3.24">pedal touching the steering wheel a</text><text start="381.1" dur="3.87">little bit I can do the same demo with</text><text start="382.96" dur="3.51">open pilot you know magicians do this</text><text start="384.97" dur="3.21">all the time you got the guy in the back</text><text start="386.47" dur="3.48">seat to distract the guy who you doing</text><text start="388.18" dur="3.39">the trick for you put the guy in the</text><text start="389.95" dur="2.91">front seat who&amp;#39;s actually like stuff in</text><text start="391.57" dur="1.74">the rabbit in the Hat when nobody&amp;#39;s</text><text start="392.86" dur="2.85">looking</text><text start="393.31" dur="3.96">look I&amp;#39;m not saying this is true I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="395.71" dur="7.11">just saying it could be true we&amp;#39;re all</text><text start="397.27" dur="8.58">having fun here believe this one look at</text><text start="402.82" dur="6.63">this one okay so here&amp;#39;s a car here&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="405.85" dur="5.31">vehicle right I want you to watch I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="409.45" dur="4.41">gonna slow this down the maximum I can</text><text start="411.16" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re going down to 0.25 speed all right</text><text start="413.86" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;m one of those conspiracy guys on</text><text start="415.6" dur="6.81">YouTube now take a look at when it</text><text start="419.02" dur="6.6">breaks right as a human when would you</text><text start="422.41" dur="4.17">hit the brakes right the brakes are hit</text><text start="425.62" dur="3.99">right there</text><text start="426.58" dur="5.64">well after obviously that car is is in</text><text start="429.61" dur="3.9">your path right now I can&amp;#39;t tell for</text><text start="432.22" dur="3.42">sure or not whether this was a</text><text start="433.51" dur="4.53">disengagement but this is not what a</text><text start="435.64" dur="4.35">human driver would this looks to me like</text><text start="438.04" dur="3.93">they were expecting the autonomous</text><text start="439.99" dur="3.87">system to break the autonomous system</text><text start="441.97" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t break what you could probably</text><text start="443.86" dur="3.63">really do is if you take this video</text><text start="445.66" dur="5.82">frame by frame you could see exactly</text><text start="447.49" dur="5.58">like what the braking look at this look</text><text start="451.48" dur="3.72">at this you could see exactly what the</text><text start="453.07" dur="3.72">braking trajectory was like right and</text><text start="455.2" dur="3.68">then it starts to break hard here at the</text><text start="456.79" dur="6.33">last minute you can see the buck forward</text><text start="458.88" dur="6.49">oh you know what you know what wait wait</text><text start="463.12" dur="6.74">let&amp;#39;s do a quick bonus video of Pony AI</text><text start="465.37" dur="4.49">Oh Pony AI is my favorite</text><text start="473.72" dur="6.91">okay so Pony AI is using a Lincoln MKZ</text><text start="476.67" dur="6.78">um ah</text><text start="480.63" dur="4.47">this part of the scene okay so this part</text><text start="483.45" dur="4.41">of the scene for the Pony AI you can see</text><text start="485.1" dur="4.02">there they have the sorry sorry sorry we</text><text start="487.86" dur="2.4">got a little distracted of Zeus why</text><text start="489.12" dur="2.67">would you do this for a minute because I</text><text start="490.26" dur="2.88">found this video really funny so here we</text><text start="491.79" dur="3">go they&amp;#39;re gonna look at this cyclist</text><text start="493.14" dur="5.07">here watch the steering wheel</text><text start="494.79" dur="6.03">look how it jerked like that that is not</text><text start="498.21" dur="4.64">a self-driving car that is a human in</text><text start="500.82" dur="4.95">the backseat with an Xbox controller</text><text start="502.85" dur="5.23">like this isn&amp;#39;t off-the-shelf demo car</text><text start="505.77" dur="3.21">so this is worse than Zeus okay this is</text><text start="508.08" dur="2.37">worse than Zeus</text><text start="508.98" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s things out there worse than Zeus</text><text start="510.45" dur="2.97">let&amp;#39;s not say Zeus is the walkway oh</text><text start="512.22" dur="2.85">wait you want to you want to watch the</text><text start="513.42" dur="3.54">wheel get jerked by the Xbox controller</text><text start="515.07" dur="6.53">guy again let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s really go to it</text><text start="516.96" dur="4.64">we&amp;#39;ll go to point 5 speed here alright</text><text start="522.26" dur="5.5">now to be fair the car was probably</text><text start="525.45" dur="4.17">autonomous up until that point and it</text><text start="527.76" dur="4.23">probably did autonomously brake for the</text><text start="529.62" dur="4.02">biker and then in order to make it seem</text><text start="531.99" dur="3.12">smooth look look look look look so this</text><text start="533.64" dur="3.75">is right when the human jerks the wheel</text><text start="535.11" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s clearly an Xbox controller</text><text start="537.39" dur="4.65">maneuver oh we&amp;#39;re gonna hit something</text><text start="540.09" dur="3.48">good heads up jerk the wheel right come</text><text start="542.04" dur="4.5">on pony aaaah you can do better</text><text start="543.57" dur="4.17">um no yeah you wanna what you want to</text><text start="546.54" dur="4.53">watch the collision you guys wanna watch</text><text start="547.74" dur="6.24">the phantom AI collision uh-huh but yeah</text><text start="551.07" dur="6.54">so this is all I could really nitpick</text><text start="553.98" dur="6">from the zukes video to be fair it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="557.61" dur="4.11">too bad I just wish they&amp;#39;d wear it like</text><text start="559.98" dur="3.33">so big with the hype do you talk about</text><text start="561.72" dur="3.21">your diss engagements openly and</text><text start="563.31" dur="3.54">publicly by the way I&amp;#39;m the highway</text><text start="564.93" dur="5.04">Carly I had zero but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="566.85" dur="5.55">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because what matters</text><text start="569.97" dur="8.16">is hype so now on we&amp;#39;re pivoting the</text><text start="572.4" dur="6.87">full hype got a pivot to hide bro oh so</text><text start="578.13" dur="3.74">let&amp;#39;s see what else we can pick out of</text><text start="579.27" dur="2.6">the nukes video</text><text start="585.52" dur="8.23">now honestly if this was all that Zook</text><text start="590.51" dur="5.49">showed this is at least something</text><text start="593.75" dur="4.74">putting them you know I think a bit</text><text start="596" dur="4.11">behind but somewhat reasonable no I</text><text start="598.49" dur="3.75">could have been a ps4 controller no no</text><text start="600.11" dur="3.87">no you don&amp;#39;t understand you can buy that</text><text start="602.24" dur="3.57">car from autonomous stuff and it comes</text><text start="603.98" dur="3.89">with an Xbox controller so I&amp;#39;m sure it</text><text start="605.81" dur="5.52">was an Xbox controller</text><text start="607.87" dur="5.17">um stop-and-go rav4 yeah well sorry</text><text start="611.33" dur="6.96">flashes yeah

start="631.52" dur="3.99">I think if you really looked at this</text><text start="633.71" dur="7.1">frame for friend you could probably find</text><text start="635.51" dur="9.69">more dis engagements maybe free panda oh</text><text start="640.81" dur="6.37">oh it&amp;#39;s wow you&amp;#39;re here you reviewed the</text><text start="645.2" dur="4.889">whole drug did they disengage the</text><text

start="661.13" dur="4.14">okay well so the autonomous mode was</text><text start="663.709" dur="3.691">engaged the whole time so we&amp;#39;ve been in</text><text start="665.27" dur="4.17">cars where they say the word autonomous</text><text start="667.4" dur="4.35">the whole time but the safety driver did</text><text start="669.44" dur="4.019">corrections so we can engage the</text><text
