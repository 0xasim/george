dur="21.211">person we have one person two people the</text><text start="19.37" dur="11.76">Tesla says all right so I think we</text><text start="28.61" dur="5.13">should kind of go through this all right</text><text start="31.13" dur="5.7">because this is kind of a lot of what I</text><text start="33.74" dur="5.73">see is wrong with how modern companies</text><text start="36.83" dur="7.07">communicate I&amp;#39;m so changing the world</text><text start="39.47" dur="7.08">with with AV that&amp;#39;s all great this guy</text><text start="43.9" dur="6.63">then you have a big a big a big</text><text start="46.55" dur="12.3">statement cautionary note on</text><text start="50.53" dur="9.94">forward-looking statements basically</text><text start="58.85" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s saying like we can&amp;#39;t predict the</text><text start="60.47" dur="7.829">future right so this is this is like</text><text start="63.32" dur="8.069">thing one no right this is this</text><text start="68.299" dur="4.68">shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be a thing I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="71.389" dur="2.91">sure what kind of world we live in where</text><text start="72.979" dur="6.71">it&amp;#39;s like you have to make a claim that</text><text start="74.299" dur="5.39">we cannot predict them but let&amp;#39;s move on</text><text start="80.229" dur="3.67">GM&amp;#39;s world you know I&amp;#39;m not gonna be</text><text start="82.34" dur="2.729">able to do this that well because I was</text><text start="83.899" dur="3.841">just I was just talking about it with</text><text start="85.069" dur="8.4">Vivian and like why something like this</text><text start="87.74" dur="7.019">is absurd so you know if you have</text><text start="93.469" dur="4.22">something like the trade-off between</text><text start="94.759" dur="6.661">socialism and libertarianism there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="97.689" dur="4.901">arguments to be made on both sides right</text><text start="101.42" dur="4.5">if you have like a trade-off between</text><text start="102.59" dur="5.43">cameras and lidar there&amp;#39;s arguments to</text><text start="105.92" dur="3.719">be made on both sides and you could have</text><text start="108.02" dur="2.97">a camera you could have a company that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="109.639" dur="2.55">committed to cameras are committed to</text><text start="110.99" dur="4.5">light our committed to socialism</text><text start="112.189" dur="6.871">committed to libertarianism but in order</text><text start="115.49" dur="5.219">for that to like make any sense you need</text><text start="119.06" dur="3.21">to have like a reasonable not like a</text><text start="120.709" dur="3.15">like a really stupid straw man you would</text><text start="122.27" dur="3.509">need I&amp;#39;m gonna go reasonable you know</text><text start="123.859" dur="4.171">thing that you are in order for you to</text><text start="125.779" dur="3.721">be saying anything you have to be able</text><text start="128.03" dur="3.57">to reasonably imagine</text><text start="129.5" dur="5.1">somebody&amp;#39;s saying the opposite right so</text><text start="131.6" dur="7.02">let&amp;#39;s look at these things zero crashes</text><text start="134.6" dur="6">zero emission zero congestion so good</text><text start="138.62" dur="5.94">could you imagine somebody coming out in</text><text start="140.6" dur="6.03">favor of crashes good good boy could you</text><text start="144.56" dur="6.03">imagine some company coming out saying</text><text start="146.63" dur="5.7">well yeah like that&amp;#39;s not a everything</text><text start="150.59" dur="2.94">in engineering and this is Yuma shows</text><text start="152.33" dur="3.9">you that these people aren&amp;#39;t engineers</text><text start="153.53" dur="5.16">they don&amp;#39;t think like engineers is about</text><text start="156.23" dur="4.14">trade-offs right if you&amp;#39;re designing a</text><text start="158.69" dur="6.12">microprocessor you make a trade-off</text><text start="160.37" dur="6.99">between say speed and power or you can</text><text start="164.81" dur="4.77">make trade-offs between like reliability</text><text start="167.36" dur="4.65">and cost engineering is all about</text><text start="169.58" dur="5.34">trade-offs I&amp;#39;m not sure what this is</text><text start="172.01" dur="5.52">right everybody who wants there to be</text><text start="174.92" dur="5.34">zero crashes but to say like gee I was</text><text start="177.53" dur="5.61">worldview like this is actually a unique</text><text start="180.26" dur="7.14">and distinctive worldview it&amp;#39;s not this</text><text start="183.14" dur="6.42">says nothing zero emissions zero</text><text start="187.4" dur="3.93">congestion nobody wants those things</text><text start="189.56" dur="4.83">right even you might have some people</text><text start="191.33" dur="5.04">who may not care about emissions but but</text><text start="194.39" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re not opposed to zero it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="196.37" dur="5.04">something that like everybody knows is</text><text start="198.32" dur="8.4">better this is not this is saying</text><text start="201.41" dur="7.47">nothing we are redefining the future of</text><text start="206.72" dur="3.87">personal mobility right so you then go</text><text start="208.88" dur="4.079">through all of these things and I mean</text><text start="210.59" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re not these are all different</text><text start="212.959" dur="3.571">companies you talk about electric</text><text start="214.67" dur="3">vehicles maybe you have like Tesla&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="216.53" dur="2.7">leader you talk about autonomous</text><text start="217.67" dur="3.03">vehicles maybe have way mostly there you</text><text start="219.23" dur="7.17">talk about shared mobility maybe you</text><text start="220.7" dur="8.069">have Ober is the leader I&amp;#39;m not okay but</text><text start="226.4" dur="3.96">I read about it so these sort of things</text><text start="228.769" dur="3.451">yeah committed to the future of strong</text><text start="230.36" dur="4.71">cores the foundation for investing in</text><text start="232.22" dur="6.239">the future electrification um so here&amp;#39;s</text><text start="235.07" dur="6.449">another interesting thing that I noted</text><text start="238.459" dur="5.491">in here where they talk about Eevee is</text><text start="241.519" dur="8.011">the foundation for autonomous vehicles</text><text start="243.95" dur="9.72">up why because it supports our zero</text><text start="249.53" dur="7.11">emissions future again your companies</text><text start="253.67" dur="4.289">are not being led by engineers and this</text><text start="256.64" dur="6.66">is why you will lose</text><text start="257.959" dur="8.201">um you know or they say like there is no</text><text start="263.3" dur="5.05">AV without Evie I mean of course there</text><text start="266.16" dur="6.08">is right look WAY Moe&amp;#39;s doing it right</text><text start="268.35" dur="6.12">way most Pacifica they&amp;#39;re hybrids but</text><text start="272.24" dur="3.82">autonomous vehicles are very different</text><text start="274.47" dur="4.14">from electric vehicles because if you</text><text start="276.06" dur="5.76">had one autonomous vehicle it would be</text><text start="278.61" dur="5.76">incredibly useful just having you in one</text><text start="281.82" dur="5.07">autonomous vehicle is useful having you</text><text start="284.37" dur="4.62">in one electric vehicle is not that</text><text start="286.89" dur="4.38">useful because you need infrastructure</text><text start="288.99" dur="3.75">to support it so sometimes I think to</text><text start="291.27" dur="3.24">say things very quickly like you know</text><text start="292.74" dur="4.83">Evie is a shared infrastructure problem</text><text start="294.51" dur="4.83">but it is you don&amp;#39;t need infrastructure</text><text start="297.57" dur="3.21">to support autonomous vehicles and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="299.34" dur="4.38">important to notice all the people out</text><text start="300.78" dur="8.88">there talking about like V to V and V to</text><text start="303.72" dur="7.95">I you actually need you you yeah</text><text start="309.66" dur="3.3">electric vehicles of course the main</text><text start="311.67" dur="3.69">thing that you need is is charging</text><text start="312.96" dur="3.99">stations so unless you have quick</text><text start="315.36" dur="3.63">charging stations like even if you have</text><text start="316.95" dur="2.64">a car that&amp;#39;s capable of charging in five</text><text start="318.99" dur="2.37">minutes</text><text start="319.59" dur="3.27">when you look at how many megawatts of</text><text start="321.36" dur="5.1">power you&amp;#39;d have to pump through the</text><text start="322.86" dur="7.89">thing but this isn&amp;#39;t gonna be that long</text><text start="326.46" dur="6.66">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see Lea my AV strategy right</text><text start="330.75" dur="5.1">uh you know traffic fatalities are</text><text start="333.12" dur="7.17">caused by human error everyone knows</text><text start="335.85" dur="6.42">that parking okay we believe all a V&amp;#39;s</text><text start="340.29" dur="5.46">must be V&amp;#39;s on I have no idea why that</text><text start="342.27" dur="6.24">like are you making an argument here or</text><text start="345.75" dur="4.14">these just like statements independent</text><text start="348.51" dur="4.92">you know what else does this like TED</text><text start="349.89" dur="6.45">Talks you ever see that like and when I</text><text start="353.43" dur="13.08">press this button words will appear on</text><text start="356.34" dur="20.25">the screen so let&amp;#39;s see if they get into</text><text start="366.51" dur="16.53">the technology Batman look at that lines</text><text start="376.59" dur="10.19">will go up bad lines will go down but</text><text start="383.04" dur="3.74">most lines will go up Oh</text><text start="392.849" dur="7.56">okay first mover escape velocity your</text><text start="398.08" dur="5.579">transportation service again um the</text><text start="400.409" dur="6.431">transportation of the service I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="403.659" dur="6.091">really sure why autonomous vehicles make</text><text start="406.84" dur="4.889">transportation as a service cheaper but</text><text start="409.75" dur="6.509">I&amp;#39;m not sure there is some truly</text><text start="411.729" dur="6.93">critical threshold for it&amp;#39;s the reason a</text><text start="416.259" dur="4.62">lot more people for a lot of people</text><text start="418.659" dur="3.871">using uber would be cheaper than then</text><text start="420.879" dur="3.961">car ownership but they&amp;#39;re not making a</text><text start="422.53" dur="4.259">rational evaluation about this they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="424.84" dur="3.96">not making like a rational decision</text><text start="426.789" dur="3.72">because most purchases are irrational</text><text start="428.8" dur="8.58">does a huge advertising business which</text><text start="430.509" dur="10.021">support this um so they&amp;#39;re still talking</text><text start="437.38" dur="5.4">about how they&amp;#39;re gonna do any of this</text><text start="440.53" dur="3.12">safety is the gating metric yeah okay</text><text start="442.78" dur="3.78">sure sure sure</text><text start="443.65" dur="6">GM is uniquely positioned in the IRT as</text><text start="446.56" dur="6.06">I say the word uniqueness in this in</text><text start="449.65" dur="5.669">this presentation oh okay so it&amp;#39;s so</text><text start="452.62" dur="3.169">execution um talent is the foundation</text><text start="455.319" dur="3.961">right</text><text start="455.789" dur="5.231">so so when you brag about talent you</text><text start="459.28" dur="8.039">brag about how you&amp;#39;ve recruited people</text><text start="461.02" dur="10.679">from uber and Google boo at Google our</text><text start="467.319" dur="7.921">competitors in this space how do you win</text><text start="471.699" dur="4.951">if you are bragging about it&amp;#39;s okay</text><text start="475.24" dur="2.789">there&amp;#39;s lots of ways you could you can</text><text start="476.65" dur="4.59">still win but you need you need</text><text start="478.029" dur="5.341">something else right um and I&amp;#39;ll explain</text><text start="481.24" dur="5.25">a concept in in in poker called called</text><text start="483.37" dur="8.97">domination and domination basically are</text><text start="486.49" dur="9.39">look like if your hand is ace king this</text><text start="492.34" dur="5.639">is a pretty good hand to have unless</text><text start="495.88" dur="9.42">somebody else at the table has baseness</text><text start="497.979" dur="10.351">alright this is Texas Hold&amp;#39;em if seventy</text><text start="505.3" dur="5.33">nine wow people are into this man okay</text><text start="508.33" dur="4.62">so so listen if flop comes over right</text><text start="510.63" dur="3.82">let&amp;#39;s say let&amp;#39;s say so so figured you</text><text start="512.95" dur="3">have a go-go player one sitting here</text><text start="514.45" dur="5.129">with an ace and your player two sitting</text><text start="515.95" dur="5.519">here with a scam right um if the flop</text><text start="519.579" dur="2.921">comes over and there&amp;#39;s an ace on the</text><text start="521.469" dur="4.321">flop let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="522.5" dur="7.2">something like ace seven six right</text><text start="525.79" dur="5.95">player 2 thinks through in a good</text><text start="529.7" dur="3.75">position to aces but they&amp;#39;re really not</text><text start="531.74" dur="4.26">because player 1 has has three aces</text><text start="533.45" dur="6.12">right let&amp;#39;s even say it it&amp;#39;s Kings at</text><text start="536" dur="5.04">six right player two still believes that</text><text start="539.57" dur="5.04">they are in a good position</text><text start="541.04" dur="5.73">even though player 1 is right now</text><text start="544.61" dur="6.03">player 3 is of course sitting at the</text><text start="546.77" dur="4.95">table with you know eight nine eight</text><text start="550.64" dur="4.5">nine maybe there are suited connectors</text><text start="551.72" dur="7.59">right player three is in a better</text><text start="555.14" dur="5.76">position than player two right because</text><text start="559.31" dur="3.65">think about how many outs player 2 has</text><text start="560.9" dur="5.85">versus how many outs player three has</text><text start="562.96" dur="6.82">even if they came up the only real way</text><text start="566.75" dur="4.71">player 2 wins this not with another ace</text><text start="569.78" dur="6.87">right another ace player 3 is three of a</text><text start="571.46" dur="7.71">kind to two pair but even if another</text><text start="576.65" dur="4.17">king comes up that&amp;#39;s the the only way</text><text start="579.17" dur="4.26">player 2 can win as if a king comes up</text><text start="580.82" dur="4.8">right versus player three which could</text><text start="583.43" dur="3.42">win of either a a 10 or 5 cuts I write a</text><text start="585.62" dur="7.86">lot their strengths minister it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="586.85" dur="8.82">be so you do not want to be player 2 and</text><text start="593.48" dur="9.39">I&amp;#39;ll mark you why Cruz is player 2 right</text><text start="595.67" dur="8.84">now all components need to be six I</text><text start="602.87" dur="6.12">developed for a successful launch right</text><text start="604.51" dur="9.52">the problem is the exact same slide</text><text start="608.99" dur="10.77">exists at lame-o but way mo has more of</text><text start="614.03" dur="7.38">these boxes filled in you know I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="619.76" dur="2.13">really hoping like like why am I doing</text><text start="621.41" dur="2.25">this</text><text start="621.89" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m really hoping some investors will be</text><text start="623.66" dur="5.61">able to hopefully like start to</text><text start="626.45" dur="6.21">critically evaluate what this space</text><text start="629.27" dur="5.52">looks like and realized why if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="632.66" dur="5.28">the Ace King if you&amp;#39;re saying I&amp;#39;m going</text><text start="634.79" dur="9.96">to build what way mo is building how are</text><text start="637.94" dur="10.37">you going to beat way mo so you know</text><text start="644.75" dur="6.57">silver bullet for AV technology I mean</text><text start="648.31" dur="5.38">really that&amp;#39;s at least a statement</text><text start="651.32" dur="3.569">that&amp;#39;s at least a statement where</text><text start="653.69" dur="4.23">something&amp;#39;s being said it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="654.889" dur="4.32">but their compote is an engineer this is</text><text start="657.92" dur="2.939">a section right he is he is an engineer</text><text start="659.209" dur="3.75">you can tell that he&amp;#39;s thinking like an</text><text start="660.859" dur="7.35">engineer because he&amp;#39;s making statements</text><text start="662.959" dur="7.38">that have another like you you can argue</text><text start="668.209" dur="4.65">the other side right now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text><text start="670.339" dur="4.74">your side is wrong but you are wrong by</text><text start="672.859" dur="3.84">default if there is no other side or</text><text start="675.079" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re not even wrong you&amp;#39;re just saying</text><text start="676.699" dur="4.74">nothing and this is something that</text><text start="678.829" dur="5.34">everybody should use when they evaluate</text><text start="681.439" dur="4.8">anything in the world right like think</text><text start="684.169" dur="7.5">about the other position and whether</text><text start="686.239" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s a viable position right if people</text><text start="691.669" dur="7.02">stopped like like likley please start</text><text start="693.739" dur="6.39">evaluating what is being said right and</text><text start="698.689" dur="2.73">now you&amp;#39;ll think about the other side</text><text start="700.129" dur="3.091">and don&amp;#39;t attribute Mouse to the other</text><text start="701.419" dur="3.39">side if there is another side right but</text><text start="703.22" dur="4.739">if there is no this type realize you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="704.809" dur="7.68">saying nothing cool</text><text start="707.959" dur="5.761">so no silver bullet for a check for any</text><text start="712.489" dur="2.82">technology I mean maybe there is right</text><text start="713.72" dur="3.599">there was a silver bullet for a girl</text><text start="715.309" dur="4.71">playing I mean maybe now I&amp;#39;ll get into</text><text start="717.319" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;ll do a little bit of contrasting this</text><text start="720.019" dur="4.8">with what comma believes um so there was</text><text start="723.019" dur="3.93">a silver bullet for go playing right if</text><text start="724.819" dur="3.81">you can you can kind of think of all the</text><text start="726.949" dur="3.24">same stuff if you are trying to build a</text><text start="728.629" dur="3.45">go agent you can imagine a company</text><text start="730.189" dur="3.57">trying to build a go agent um you know</text><text start="732.079" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re like well okay so we&amp;#39;re gonna do</text><text start="733.759" dur="4.44">some sort of some awesome some endgame</text><text start="735.439" dur="5.49">study some some opening moves study some</text><text start="738.199" dur="4.2">jokes Seki study you right and the truth</text><text start="740.929" dur="2.91">is that none of this matter at all I</text><text start="742.399" dur="2.16">mean in fact so much didn&amp;#39;t matter at</text><text start="743.839" dur="2.37">all that you didn&amp;#39;t even need the</text><text start="744.559" dur="4.97">historical data you just needed to build</text><text

there&amp;#39;s another stack the</text><text start="976.54" dur="5.82">other stack is the amount stack and this</text><text start="979.45" dur="11.04">is kind of where comma lies and we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="982.36" dur="13.95">testing lies so if you think about big</text><text start="990.49" dur="8.31">data and machine now you can of course</text><text start="996.31" dur="5.1">like the same argument for for comma and</text><text start="998.8" dur="3.99">Tesla between between Google Cruz are</text><text start="1001.41" dur="3.75">you talking about I tell actually both</text><text start="1002.79" dur="4.92">the advantages here um but we</text><text start="1005.16" dur="7.56">acknowledge this fact right and the idea</text><text start="1007.71" dur="6.66">is Tesla has a disadvantage Tesla has a</text><text start="1012.72" dur="5.45">substantial disadvantage and Tesla&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1014.37" dur="6.33">disadvantages the following proprietor

Tesla&amp;#39;s never go into licensed</text><text start="1030.69" dur="5.43">autopilot technology probably pretty</text><text start="1033.45" dur="4.32">likely um then you can talk about you</text><text start="1036.12" dur="3.36">know this is working okay for comma and</text><text start="1037.77" dur="4.59">you can also believe that Tesla will</text><text start="1039.48" dur="5.16">never build non electrical um and the</text><text start="1042.36" dur="4.83">thing here is autonomous is going to</text><text start="1044.64" dur="3.78">happen before electric because of that</text><text start="1047.19" dur="3.5">network effect that I talked about</text><text start="1048.42" dur="2.27">before</text><text start="1050.81" dur="4.02">about how we can&amp;#39;t have the

dur="9.6">too but you know it&amp;#39;s not my worldview</text><text start="1058.82" dur="9.51">right so let&amp;#39;s go back to the this is</text><text start="1066.29" dur="7.1">really the main point I want to make</text><text start="1068.33" dur="5.06">right like how are you going to be</text><text start="1073.87" dur="4.72">justice Google Google understands their</text><text start="1077.21" dur="2.73">execution problem like at least they</text><text start="1078.59" dur="2.58">understand what their own mistake so</text><text start="1079.94" dur="3.48">they can bring it out

dur="3.81">were label of course but I would be</text><text start="1093.68" dur="4.44">doing is I would open that the Pacifica</text><text start="1096.08" dur="4.02">platform all right now to people right</text><text start="1098.12" dur="19.14">just just just do it man just ship it</text><text start="1100.1" dur="18.06">you know who actually this firm we</text><text start="1117.26" dur="3.96">talked about some time in the office</text><text start="1118.16" dur="6.33">right imagine instead of Google Fiber it</text><text start="1121.22" dur="5.28">was called uber fiber you know that</text><text start="1124.49" dur="4.68">would be everywhere they&amp;#39;d be crushing</text><text start="1126.5" dur="4.71">ISPs left and right Comcast would be in</text><text start="1129.17" dur="7.77">a corner crying like the taxi companies</text><text start="1131.21" dur="7.77">are right now that&amp;#39;s why we slap Comcast</text><text start="1136.94" dur="7.44">don&amp;#39;t

that way my eyes right this is</text><text start="1154.64" dur="9.78">literally way most for requirements for</text><text start="1159.08" dur="8.43">launching as well um anchored by</text><text

business I cool things</text><text start="1172.64" dur="5.24">that nobody understands in disclaim okay</text><text start="1174.32" dur="6.06">cool um but yeah do you have questions</text><text start="1177.88" dur="6.04">not really people are excited</text><text start="1180.38" dur="4.89">for uber fiber fiber is gonna be sick</text><text start="1183.92" dur="3.48">man yep</text><text

that&amp;#39;s dead well okay so</text><text start="1191.65" dur="5.74">you can talk about the traditional stack</text><text start="1194.42" dur="6">or the ml stack right um which one of</text><text start="1197.39" dur="4.68">these wins is it yet to be discovered</text><text start="1200.42" dur="4.44">fact about the world</text><text start="1202.07" dur="5.91">um maybe maybe this is even like

our advantages over Tesla you</text><text start="1326.63" dur="10.25">see like the equipment is if way mo wins</text><text start="1330.41" dur="9.18">and beats crews they beat crews if
