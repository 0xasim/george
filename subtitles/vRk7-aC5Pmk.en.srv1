which</text><text start="4526.54" dur="6.119">is what neural networks are you look at</text><text start="4530.59" dur="3.45">the CPUs die and you realize really only</text><text start="4532.659" dur="3.211">like two or three percent of the</text><text start="4534.04" dur="4.949">transistors are dedicated to doing this</text><text start="4535.87" dur="5.369">so there&amp;#39;s clearly a room
