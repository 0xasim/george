your</text><text start="10.15" dur="4.46">private data trying to be there but</text><text start="12.28" dur="2.33">again</text><text start="17.99" dur="8.17">device itself or us those are way more</text><text start="20.94" dur="7.679">useful type of data that we can use the</text><text start="26.16" dur="6.209">function that we cannot with just that</text><text start="28.619" dur="5.76">and so yeah I mean that is that like as</text><text start="32.369" dur="4.76">you can see the tribe is very strong</text><text start="34.379" dur="5.461">before from multiple users likely and so</text><text start="37.129" dur="4.601">the amount of like good high definition</text><text start="39.84" dur="6.48">day that we that were interested in to</text><text start="41.73" dur="6.12">circulate and we respect we come to make</text><text start="46.32" dur="3.21">pretty much like insignificant the</text><text start="47.85" dur="9.24">amount of data that we actually get from</text><text start="49.53" dur="9.869">purely from the compromise like how how</text><text start="57.09" dur="4.23">scalable you want the system to be like</text><text start="59.399" dur="5.61">we said we plan to achieve one of the</text><text start="61.32" dur="5.64">media minds in like a year or something</text><text start="65.009" dur="4.161">more than something more than a year and</text><text start="66.96" dur="6.78">so this code the trade-off is between</text><text start="69.17" dur="5.949">how how defined how like how much data</text><text start="73.74" dur="2.97">you want to collect all sophisticated</text><text start="75.119" dur="4.53">you want to be a physical action caster</text><text start="76.71" dur="5.1">scalability and we believe that we found</text><text start="79.649" dur="4.26">kind of like the best sweet spot with</text><text start="81.81" dur="5.01">open pilot people driving with with our</text><text start="83.909" dur="5.131">dash cam with Iran with the unibody so</text><text start="86.82" dur="3.69">because you kind of connect all the data</text><text start="89.04" dur="5.12">we need</text><text start="90.51" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s like scare what I&amp;#39;m untamable so</text><text start="94.16" dur="3.94">every company works on spaces their own</text><text start="96.66" dur="7.38">definition like the or definition of the</text><text start="98.1" dur="9.84">type of it&amp;#39;d be about our size pink</text><text start="104.04" dur="6.87">party impiety yes sorry I came only to</text><text start="107.94" dur="5.34">skip the zipper incident but it strikes</text><text start="110.91" dur="4.2">me that I think like tests these other</text><text start="113.28" dur="3.9">vehicles they have so many other sensors</text><text start="115.11" dur="5.13">they can be so much more aware of the</text><text start="117.18" dur="5.16">surrounding context so are you able to</text><text start="120.24" dur="3.96">read those from the canvas or you just</text><text start="122.34" dur="3.96">blow it off and go straight vision from</text><text start="124.2" dur="5.279">the camera how do you address that</text><text start="126.3" dur="4.92">because yeah well so not to make a</text><text start="129.479" dur="4.231">Suzanne this is a lot better than what</text><text start="131.22" dur="4.08">what should stay with the car step one</text><text start="133.71" dur="3.48">is like let&amp;#39;s use as much as possible</text><text start="135.3" dur="3.24">what you see in front of you right you</text><text start="137.19" dur="3.84">can ever season and he&amp;#39;s like a lot</text><text start="138.54" dur="4.62">better what is today using just what you</text><text start="141.03" dur="3.15">see in front of you right and there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="143.16" dur="3">good starting point which is what</text><text start="144.18" dur="4.02">provide however we can also read</text><text start="146.16" dur="3.75">everything it comes from your car so if</text><text start="148.2" dur="3.18">your car is a key for example we decided</text><text start="149.91" dur="2.46">a door so what we can read some</text><text start="151.38" dur="3.42">information from the side the other</text><text start="152.37" dur="4.32">story so we integrate with some that we</text><text start="154.8" dur="4.86">plant correctly</text><text start="156.69" dur="4.56">yeah but we do have access to the to the</text><text start="159.66" dur="4.59">other data so most of the consulship</text><text start="161.25" dur="4.08">today that are compatible with they are</text><text start="164.25" dur="3.36">equipped with adaptive cruise control</text><text start="165.33" dur="4.32">and so they already can tweet with arada</text><text start="167.61" dur="6.36">and we have used right now like the</text><text start="169.65" dur="6.27">account features so we do use as much as</text><text start="173.97" dur="3.57">possible what comes with the car and</text><text start="175.92" dur="4.08">then of course I certain point we do we</text><text start="177.54" dur="5.64">do believe that to expand the system and</text><text start="180" dur="5.07">to make the system like a more valuable</text><text start="183.18" dur="4.23">yeah you would need like mobile view</text><text start="185.07" dur="4.08">around the car but right now the</text><text start="187.41" dur="4.44">limitation is not really how much you</text><text start="189.15" dur="16.23">see is more like how when you use what</text><text start="191.85" dur="16.71">you can see OMS are taking measures to</text><text start="205.38" dur="5.52">improve the partition even security to</text><text start="208.56" dur="4.89">block exactly what open pilots trying to</text><text start="210.9" dur="6.21">do so how do you actually do that how do</text><text start="213.45" dur="6.33">you actually arranged yeah I mean open</text><text start="217.11" dur="5.97">pilots for us right now is it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="219.78" dur="4.95">development project and the way to make</text><text start="223.08" dur="3.78">up a palette scalable to have to engage</text><text start="224.73" dur="3.63">with a lot of like developers around the</text><text start="226.86" dur="4.11">world is to make a pilot what it is</text><text start="228.36" dur="4.59">today which is like a tool or software</text><text start="230.97" dur="4.92">that can work with can that people can</text><text start="232.95" dur="5.37">buy today the EM cover for karma he is</text><text start="235.89" dur="4.5">actually to engage with OEM of T one</text><text start="238.32" dur="4.26">supplier and work together to ship out</text><text start="240.39" dur="5.16">the pilot in their product in their cars</text><text start="242.58" dur="5.16">like assistant systems so if this is a</text><text start="245.55" dur="4.2">start for us it&amp;#39;s not the end goal what</text><text start="247.74" dur="5.34">we have today is not yet gone their goal</text><text start="249.75" dur="5.73">is how to hope we hope we scale and the</text><text start="253.08" dur="7.1">only way to scale is engaging with oh</text><text start="255.48" dur="4.7">yeah it actually wants to wants to ship</text><text start="261.91" dur="4.98">do you think that you&amp;#39;re gonna continue</text><text start="264.07" dur="3.71">with the windshield mounted device or is</text><text start="266.89" dur="3.86">it</text><text start="267.78" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m trying to cameras that are already</text><text start="270.75" dur="3.42">in the vehicle no you can&amp;#39;t Fellini use</text><text start="272.97" dur="2.55">the camel sense of any of the names</text><text start="274.17" dur="3.12">because they&amp;#39;re my kind of wire that</text><text start="275.52" dur="3.45">that actually we achieved it as imaging</text><text start="277.29" dur="3.5">processing so it&amp;#39;s very hard to be the</text><text start="278.97" dur="6.05">images are Fox became</text><text start="280.79" dur="6.45">they go we right now we were okay like</text><text start="285.02" dur="4.41">using my camera provided by our systems</text><text start="287.24" dur="5.1">the camera itself is like she is not</text><text start="289.43" dur="9.02">like it makes nice and Barb and I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="292.34" dur="6.11">think it would refuse otherwise yes</text><text start="299.479" dur="5.91">yeah some came from me great thank you</text><text start="303.949" dur="4.59">do i you&amp;#39;re welcome</text><text start="305.389" dur="5.881">do I have traits to get that data</text><text start="308.539" dur="13.111">absolutely somehow yes how is it</text><text start="311.27" dur="12.299">protected good question so you have</text><text start="321.65" dur="4.47">absolutely access to download your data</text><text start="323.569" dur="4.02">this is like something that we consider</text><text start="326.12" dur="3.03">a main use for developer terms like if</text><text start="327.589" dur="2.94">you are driving and you want to do some</text><text start="329.15" dur="2.37">test you want to collect data when you</text><text start="330.529" dur="3.72">should have access to your data you</text><text start="331.52" dur="4.949">should be able to know your data we like</text><text start="334.249" dur="5.25">to two to three weeks ago we released</text><text start="336.469" dur="5.07">all our most of some of the important</text><text start="339.499" dur="3.45">development tools that we use to develop</text><text start="341.539" dur="3.21">open files so that you can actually</text><text start="342.949" dur="4.171">develop the same in the same way that we</text><text start="344.749" dur="5.07">do and so you came to I collect it</text><text start="347.12" dur="4.759">downloaded it that you that you that you</text><text start="349.819" dur="4.47">actually collect and develop with</text><text start="351.879" dur="4.69">regarding the fish the driver facing</text><text start="354.289" dur="5.28">camera by default there&amp;#39;s a table in</text><text start="356.569" dur="6.12">settings by default the table yourself</text><text start="359.569" dur="5.07">so we don&amp;#39;t record your data we still</text><text start="362.689" dur="3.72">provide you the monitoring functionality</text><text start="364.639" dur="3.541">no we don&amp;#39;t record your data if you want</text><text start="366.409" dur="3.451">to contribute and give us more like data</text><text start="368.18" dur="3.509">diversity which we actually need to</text><text start="369.86" dur="3.299">develop like a better system but you can</text><text start="371.689" dur="2.19">turn it on and then we have access to</text><text start="373.159" dur="4.79">your data</text><text start="373.879" dur="4.07">but be something to other</text><text start="384.07" dur="5.55">no absolutely have no you you can decide</text><text start="387.19" dur="4.2">to share the link to your data which is</text><text start="389.62" dur="4.77">like a generated thing not something</text><text start="391.39" dur="4.83">obvious with other with other people but</text><text start="394.39" dur="3.75">of course not like other people don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="396.22" dur="5.36">have access to your data and we share</text><text start="398.14" dur="3.44">that data with other users</text><text start="408.35" dur="4.47">I think the only thing that we know</text><text start="410" dur="5.31">about the user is like their Google</text><text start="412.82" dur="4.59">login system so we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="415.31" dur="4.94">like any like personal informations</text><text start="417.41" dur="2.84">except</text><text start="422.09"

start="442.84" dur="6.12">well if he falls release 33 hours of</text><text start="446.2" dur="4.74">data that you can download from our</text><text start="448.96" dur="3.63">website so that I think that answers</text><text start="450.94" dur="3.78">your question right so we have like</text><text start="452.59" dur="4.2">three of our data that we collected</text><text start="454.72"

if you</text><text start="465.16" dur="3.96">believe it&amp;#39;s useful to developers and of</text><text start="467.919" dur="3.541">course you have access to your data so</text><text start="469.12" dur="3.96">party of data MPAs that said that we</text><text start="471.46" dur="3.929">believe could be useful for people to</text><text start="473.08" dur="4.2">live out on which comes from our</text><text start="475.389" dur="4.34">personal life that is set as comma</text><text start="477.28" dur="2.449">Engineers</text><text start="480.06" dur="2.57">yeah</text><text start="486.759"

cone is called like</text><text start="518.71" dur="4.05">Panda is like the code is also open</text><text start="520.81" dur="3.98">source people ready contributed to it</text><text start="522.76" dur="4.59">and so the project by itself</text><text start="524.79" dur="4.48">yeah we don&amp;#39;t want to bring in to an end</text><text start="527.35" dur="4.13">at all like anytime soon so
