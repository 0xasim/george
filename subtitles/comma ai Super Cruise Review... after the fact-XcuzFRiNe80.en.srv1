we</text><text start="48.62" dur="6.599">get it anywhere like it I engaged here</text><text start="50.12" dur="7.919">can I engage we are driving we drive</text><text start="55.219" dur="6.031">over to route 1 I engage it on route 1</text><text start="58.039" dur="5.281">and I&amp;#39;m like yeah the first it</text><text start="61.25" dur="4.77">disengaged around us around a turn it</text><text start="63.32" dur="5.1">disengaged around a turn took it took a</text><text start="66.02" dur="5.04">solid two or three minutes to get the</text><text start="68.42" dur="6.18">system to even recognize that it was on</text><text start="71.06" dur="5.63">a freeway yeah and it was even when it</text><text start="74.6" dur="7.79">was engaged it was it didn&amp;#39;t feel great</text><text start="76.69" dur="8.409">but then but then we got on the highway</text><text start="82.39" dur="5.709">we got on the highway we got on on 280</text><text start="85.099" dur="4.741">big clear open I wouldn&amp;#39;t say the</text><text start="88.099" dur="3.541">quality was a fifth of Honda sensing I</text><text start="89.84" dur="7.199">would say it was like on par with like</text><text

know where the bends</text><text start="101.959" dur="5.881">are pretty shallow and it was flawless</text><text start="105.399" dur="8.5">it was no super cruise doesn&amp;#39;t need</text><text start="107.84" dur="10.05">counter HD maps on huge multi-lane</text><text start="113.899" dur="7.61">highways it is absolutely flawless it</text><text start="117.89" dur="7.41">didn&amp;#39;t so first off it doesn&amp;#39;t wobble</text><text start="121.509" dur="6.191">both autopilot and open pilot wobble in</text><text start="125.3" dur="6.21">the lane you don&amp;#39;t understand how good</text><text start="127.7" dur="9.05">it feels when it doesn&amp;#39;t wobble um we</text><text start="131.51" dur="5.24">see it on the gyros okay</text><text start="148.859" dur="11.83">it&amp;#39;s literally just edge</text><text start="157.48" dur="7.77">Oh bad a/c noise ah they don&amp;#39;t like the</text><text start="160.689" dur="5.58">AC nose um yeah no no no ping-pong yeah</text><text start="165.25" dur="9.54">we turned it off we turned it off for</text><text start="166.269" dur="10.771">good but why do open pilot not of how</text><text start="174.79" dur="6.36">did GM do it it&amp;#39;s a good question you</text><text start="177.04" dur="6.36">guess oh we got it we got a good way of</text><text start="181.15" dur="4.949">lava we got to get serious about beating</text><text start="183.4" dur="3.509">the evils of wobble so one way they</text><text start="186.099" dur="3.12">might have done it</text><text start="186.909" dur="4.291">is they have maps so they know the exact</text><text start="189.219" dur="5.791">angle the car is supposed to be at at</text><text start="191.2" dur="7.5">all times they don&amp;#39;t have light are they</text><text start="195.01" dur="7.67">are using a camera to spot the lanes a</text><text start="198.7" dur="3.98">GPS and a map</text><text start="204.84" dur="11.539">behind us yeah</text><text

dur="6.5">it disengaged it disengaged</text><text start="239.32" dur="7.35">it just it wobbles the seat it turns red</text><text start="242.88" dur="5.77">yes surprising from GM I was very happy</text><text start="246.67" dur="4.8">with what supercruise I was impressed</text><text start="248.65" dur="5.03">and it just you know we have to do</text><text start="251.47"

start="530.14" dur="4.44">fans for like asymmetrical so that they</text><text start="532.33" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t make noise this is a huge point in</text><text start="534.58" dur="5.46">the keynote I&amp;#39;m not sure that&amp;#39;s patented</text><text start="537.73" dur="6.24">I think we&amp;#39;re just going with the big</text><text start="540.04" dur="5.19">fans big is the way to go it works no</text><text start="543.97" dur="2.55">but actually a lot of that um fan noise</text><text start="545.23" dur="3.48">that we can probably fix with policy</text><text start="546.52" dur="3.63">certainly I think the fan policies a</text><text start="548.71" dur="3.27">little bit too aggressive yeah because</text><text start="550.15" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s based on the CPU temperature it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="551.98" dur="3.93">not really based on the heat sink</text><text start="553.15" dur="6.11">temperature right hmm I mean do you have</text><text start="555.91" dur="3.35">a lot of sensors yeah</text><text start="560.529" dur="5.711">sliding to were sliding really cool of</text><text start="563.959" dur="3.781">that work you guys do you guys like the</text><text start="566.24" dur="3.659">sliding or do you guys like the tapping</text><text start="567.74" dur="4.98">to make that appear and disappear that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="569.899" dur="13.111">okay okay guys this is more responsive</text><text start="572.72" dur="12.44">than any automotive you I think we got</text><text start="583.01" dur="4.59">to do slide on tap it was easy</text><text start="585.16" dur="6.09">they were mostly voting for tap honestly</text><text start="587.6" dur="3.65">if you just like slap the screen</text><text start="612.47" dur="4.2">because yeah this isn&amp;#39;t how you usually</text><text start="614.25" dur="6.93">come to work</text><text start="616.67" dur="7.03">yeah it&amp;#39;s water on a timer oh yeah it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="621.18" dur="2.79">on a timer to retract is that how we do</text><text start="623.7" dur="2.76">it</text><text start="623.97" dur="7.47">mmm timer to attract time when you</text><text start="626.46" dur="6.18">retract there&amp;#39;s no well no if I just</text><text start="631.44" dur="3.18">feel like that it&amp;#39;ll time does it</text><text start="632.64" dur="3.18">eventually oh no we don&amp;#39;t have a timer</text><text start="634.62" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s a sickie</text><text start="635.82" dur="6.66">it&amp;#39;s sticky okay yeah cool</text><text start="639.51" dur="8.46">it&amp;#39;s full screen mode speed related or</text><text start="642.48" dur="7.86">that&amp;#39;s interesting hmm that&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="647.97" dur="10.83">idea when you&amp;#39;re stopped we could bring</text><text start="650.34" dur="11.01">up your applications and status yeah I</text><text start="658.8" dur="3.06">kind of like I mean even when I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="661.35" dur="1.8">stopped</text><text start="661.86" dur="4.44">I think the fullscreen view is really</text><text start="663.15"
