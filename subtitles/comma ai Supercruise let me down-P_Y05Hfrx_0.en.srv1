this</text><text start="237.75" dur="5.069">but the switch between</text><text start="240.48" dur="3.83">adaptive cruise control and normal</text><text start="242.819" dur="3.111">cruise control button</text><text start="244.31" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s kind of nice actually sometimes I</text><text start="245.93" dur="4.35">wish that is it yeah sometimes I do wish</text><text start="248.45"
