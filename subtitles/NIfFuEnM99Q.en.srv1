and</text><text start="25.019" dur="4.231">before that I did some research at the</text><text start="26.97" dur="5.699">State University for about one year on</text><text start="29.25" dur="5.88">electric vehicles I think a good way to</text><text start="32.669" dur="7.8">start talking about selling cars is to</text><text start="35.13" dur="9.48">introduce them by the 11th by the</text><text start="40.469" dur="7.831">Society the SAE divides self-driving</text><text start="44.61" dur="6.3">cars into five different levels so the</text><text start="48.3" dur="5.43">first level is a level one which is</text><text start="50.91" dur="4.89">level one well is what we can buy today</text><text start="53.73" dur="4.559">pretty much every new car that we buy is</text><text start="55.8" dur="5.309">considered level one the human is fully</text><text start="58.289" dur="4.59">in control of the car and the car</text><text start="61.109" dur="4.471">provides some driver of system features</text><text start="62.879" dur="4.441">so for example it can provide adaptive</text><text start="65.58" dur="3.27">cruise control so something that</text><text start="67.32" dur="1.95">maintains the distance with the car in</text><text start="68.85" dur="2.49">front</text><text start="69.27" dur="4.8">automatic emergency braking and lane</text><text start="71.34" dur="4.77">keep assist that allows you to go back</text><text start="74.07" dur="3.24">in the lane if you are if the car</text><text start="76.11" dur="2.579">detects that for example you are</text><text start="77.31" dur="3.12">strapped and you are departing the lane</text><text start="78.689" dur="3">but the point is you are fully in</text><text start="80.43" dur="4.829">control of the car and you&amp;#39;re constantly</text><text start="81.689" dur="6.72">interacting with the car the next level</text><text start="85.259" dur="6.75">is called able to probably the most</text><text start="88.409" dur="6.271">notable example of level 2 system is the</text><text start="92.009" dur="3.54">test auto pilot and here the the</text><text start="94.68" dur="4.079">behavior of the car is completely</text><text start="95.549" dur="6.301">different the car is now fully in</text><text start="98.759" dur="6.061">control of driving and the driver when</text><text start="101.85" dur="4.62">the system is activated system watches</text><text start="104.82" dur="3.78">that the car is actually doing the right</text><text start="106.47" dur="4.17">thing so it&amp;#39;s different we go from car</text><text start="108.6" dur="3.839">driving to the front from the driver</text><text start="110.64" dur="3.799">being fully in control to the car being</text><text start="112.439" dur="6.241">control and the driver assisting the car</text><text start="114.439" dur="6.881">the next step is is level trip I the</text><text start="118.68" dur="5.549">marked the transition to level 3 we do</text><text start="121.32" dur="4.71">it like a vertical line because here the</text><text start="124.229" dur="3.991">departing change like the main</text><text start="126.03" dur="4.649">difference is that the liability goes</text><text start="128.22" dur="3.61">from being from the driver from level 1</text><text start="130.679" dur="3.731">level 2 no matter</text><text start="131.83" dur="5.25">happens the driver is responsible for</text><text start="134.41" dur="5.6">driving from level 3 and above the car</text><text start="137.08" dur="5.37">is actually takes the responsibility</text><text start="140.01" dur="5.26">whenever they sell driving features are</text><text start="142.45" dur="4.59">active so what level 3 allows the driver</text><text start="145.27" dur="3.75">to do is allows the driver to be</text><text start="147.04" dur="4.88">distracted does not require the driver</text><text start="149.02" dur="5.97">to be ready to take over immediately and</text><text start="151.92" dur="5.86">it works a limited environment and it</text><text start="154.99" dur="4.77">always guarantees a few seconds of</text><text start="157.78" dur="3.45">safety operation even when the system</text><text start="159.76" dur="2.97">detects like a situation that cannot</text><text start="161.23" dur="3.42">handle so you imagine that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="162.73" dur="4.17">driving you are like reading a book or</text><text start="164.65" dur="4.83">reading your email the car detects</text><text start="166.9" dur="5.01">something that cannot handle then is</text><text start="169.48" dur="5.55">gonna beep at you and it&amp;#39;s gonna still</text><text start="171.91" dur="4.83">perform safe operation for maybe 5 to 8</text><text start="175.03" dur="4.38">seconds that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s considered like</text><text start="176.74" dur="4.01">a good transition time and then you have</text><text start="179.41" dur="4.59">to take control</text><text start="180.75" dur="5.29">the next step is level 4 I think that a</text><text start="184" dur="4.92">good a good example like of level 4 car</text><text start="186.04" dur="4.53">C is what we see in from deployed from</text><text start="188.92" dur="2.69">way more like there are many other</text><text start="190.57" dur="5.31">companies</text><text start="191.61" dur="7.39">zooks or crew is GM they&amp;#39;re all working</text><text start="195.88" dur="5.22">on level 4 so what level 4 is well if</text><text start="199" dur="3.51">taking the driver out of the loop like</text><text start="201.1" dur="3.78">let&amp;#39;s take the driver completely out of</text><text start="202.51" dur="5.81">the car and let&amp;#39;s have like a driverless</text><text start="204.88" dur="6.72">vehicle working in limited environment</text><text start="208.32" dur="6.76">the next example the next level is</text><text start="211.6" dur="6.21">called level 5 level 5 is devolution of</text><text start="215.08" dur="3.78">level 4 is likely before but instead of</text><text start="217.81" dur="3.45">working in with the environment is</text><text start="218.86" dur="5.43">supposed to work everywhere at any time</text><text start="221.26" dur="6.27">without a human so it needs to work at</text><text start="224.29" dur="6.15">least as good as human everywhere I</text><text start="227.53" dur="4.709">personally believe that it makes sense</text><text start="230.44" dur="3.15">I the two levels that are interesting</text><text start="232.239" dur="3.601">where people are working on are either</text><text start="233.59" dur="4.02">level 2 or level 4 and those are the</text><text start="235.84" dur="3.869">ones that we should pay close close</text><text start="237.61" dur="6.21">attention in the evolution of their</text><text start="239.709" dur="6.361">technology so what why do I say that</text><text start="243.82" dur="3.78">I like level 2 and level 4 are the most</text><text start="246.07" dur="4.56">important one well let&amp;#39;s look at the</text><text start="247.6" dur="5.07">number so let&amp;#39;s look at how many cars</text><text start="250.63" dur="3.87">like what are the distribution of the</text><text start="252.67" dur="5.069">levels on the cars today on the market</text><text start="254.5" dur="5.85">in United States it is 7.2 percent of</text><text start="257.739" dur="4.561">cars deployed like that we see on the</text><text start="260.35" dur="3.84">road today a level zero so they have no</text><text start="262.3" dur="3.149">assistance if you look around pretty</text><text start="264.19" dur="5.58">much like</text><text start="265.449" dur="7.051">one one in seven like six out of seven</text><text start="269.77" dur="5.88">cars that you see I have no assistance</text><text start="272.5" dur="5.4">at all then there is about like 12% of</text><text start="275.65" dur="3.63">cars that have level one so they have</text><text start="277.9" dur="4.41">limited assistance pretty much all the</text><text start="279.28" dur="4.8">new cars going to this category and then</text><text start="282.31" dur="6.78">there is about like a 0.2 percent of</text><text start="284.08" dur="7.26">cars that are considered level 2 I would</text><text start="289.09" dur="4.579">say the 0 2 percent is like in large</text><text start="291.34" dur="8.34">portion made by Tessa auto pilot and</text><text start="293.669" dur="7.631">like less less extent from like crew GM</text><text start="299.68" dur="7.019">and few other example that are popping</text><text start="301.3" dur="7.679">out from from automakers so what why do</text><text start="306.699" dur="4.71">I say that for example like level 3 is</text><text start="308.979" dur="4.651">not so interesting and I don&amp;#39;t see level</text><text start="311.409" dur="5.641">3 being the next evolution like the next</text><text start="313.63" dur="6.659">step to us like a driverless future</text><text start="317.05" dur="5.369">well because level 3 by definition needs</text><text start="320.289" dur="4.021">to guarantee few seconds automated</text><text start="322.419" dur="5.25">driving we anything counter situation</text><text start="324.31" dur="5.82">that you cannot handle doing that is not</text><text start="327.669" dur="5.34">easy at all imagine that the system like</text><text start="330.13" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s driving a highway at 70 miles per</text><text start="333.009" dur="2.611">hour</text><text start="333.37" dur="3.75">like maybe 775 and it encounter a</text><text start="335.62" dur="3.99">situation that does not how to handle</text><text start="337.12" dur="4.32">well doing safe operation for</text><text start="339.61" dur="3.679">five-second means that you travel pretty</text><text start="341.44" dur="7.08">much like more than a football field</text><text start="343.289" dur="7.75">doing doing and so yeah keep the car</text><text start="348.52" dur="4.29">doing something safe it&amp;#39;s pretty much as</text><text start="351.039" dur="3.421">other solving for level four even if you</text><text start="352.81" dur="3.18">only have to guarantee those those few</text><text start="354.46" dur="4.079">seconds when the current counter</text><text start="355.99" dur="5.25">situation that you cannot handle well</text><text start="358.539" dur="4.141">you can say well yeah but it&amp;#39;s true what</text><text start="361.24" dur="4.079">you&amp;#39;re saying but there is one car that</text><text start="362.68" dur="5.19">actually shipped on the market the test</text><text start="365.319" dur="6.72">level 3 and it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s called a e8</text><text start="367.87" dur="7.109">is the Audi a8 it that it did not ship</text><text start="372.039" dur="5.551">us for regulatory reasons but let&amp;#39;s look</text><text start="374.979" dur="4.891">at the limitation of such system so you</text><text start="377.59" dur="3.629">need to be on a multi-lane you order you</text><text start="379.87" dur="2.82">need to be you have to have bar in</text><text start="381.219" dur="4.741">between lanes so pretty much like on a</text><text start="382.69" dur="4.74">high-speed highway you need to have</text><text start="385.96" dur="3.66">structure along the edge to make sure</text><text start="387.43" dur="3.959">that there are no pedestrians your speed</text><text start="389.62" dur="3.93">needs to be lower than 37 miles per hour</text><text start="391.389" dur="4.14">and the speed of the surrounding</text><text start="393.55" dur="3.449">vehicles is also low</text><text start="395.529" dur="4.23">so the</text><text start="396.999" dur="4.92">this is almost impossible situation to</text><text start="399.759" dur="3.93">meet and it&amp;#39;s not what level Terry&amp;#39;s</text><text start="401.919" dur="4.17">supposed to be is just like an extension</text><text start="403.689" dur="4.171">of level two if something goes wrong in</text><text start="406.089" dur="3.93">this situation nothing bad can really</text><text start="407.86" dur="7.139">happen and so yes the car can take like</text><text start="410.019" dur="7.26">liability for the situation it does not</text><text start="414.999" dur="3.81">scale to situation like requiring faster</text><text start="417.279" dur="5.73">reaction time if you&amp;#39;re driving highway</text><text start="418.809" dur="6.66">at high speed you you need to be able to</text><text start="423.009" dur="7.02">handle the situation and probably you</text><text start="425.469" dur="5.61">need like level four technology so what</text><text start="430.029" dur="1.8">about there before level so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="431.079" dur="3.33">interesting it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text><text start="431.829" dur="6.39">technical challenge there are a lot of</text><text start="434.409" dur="5.79">companies working on it but what woody</text><text start="438.219" dur="4.11">is live at four what does level four try</text><text start="440.199" dur="4.02">to solve that well let&amp;#39;s think about it</text><text start="442.329" dur="5.37">which is the definition of likely before</text><text start="444.219" dur="4.2">so like we have level four car so how do</text><text start="447.699" dur="2.58">they work</text><text start="448.419" dur="4.2">well the idea is that they allow you to</text><text start="450.279" dur="5.82">go from point A to point B without</text><text start="452.619" dur="5.97">requiring you to drive and if you think</text><text start="456.099" dur="5.79">about it these already exist like the</text><text start="458.589" dur="5.31">taxi there uber I can I can use public</text><text start="461.889" dur="4.68">transportation so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="463.899" dur="4.53">replace a service that already exists</text><text start="466.569" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s not gonna be more practical it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="468.429" dur="3">not gonna be more practical the rubber</text><text start="469.689" dur="2.7">is not gonna be more practical in</text><text start="471.429" dur="1.98">certain cases in the public</text><text start="472.389" dur="2.52">transportation if you live in Manhattan</text><text start="473.409" dur="2.91">you want to go from point A to point B</text><text start="474.909" dur="3.75">probably taking the metro is the best</text><text start="476.319" dur="4.291">way to do it so what&amp;#39;s the advantage of</text><text start="478.659" dur="3.36">living for well the Vantage is the idea</text><text start="480.61" dur="3.869">that they are going to cost less why</text><text start="482.019" dur="3.87">because the idea is to remove the driver</text><text start="484.479" dur="4.44">and to remove the cost of the driver</text><text start="485.889" dur="7.95">which I personally have some some doubts</text><text start="488.919" dur="7.05">by when you pay dry you will drive it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="493.839" dur="6.15">not a big portion of your fare that goes</text><text start="495.969" dur="5.52">to the driver the big majority pays for</text><text start="499.989" dur="7.44">the car maintenance their insurer gas</text><text start="501.489" dur="7.98">and the fees to Ober so level four by</text><text start="507.429" dur="3.95">definition since it&amp;#39;s not supposed to</text><text start="509.469" dur="4.831">drive anywhere anytime</text><text start="511.379" dur="4.54">does not compete with Kenosha P is that</text><text start="514.3" dur="3.599">meant when the car ownership but this</text><text start="515.919" dur="3.99">idea that whenever four succeed the</text><text start="517.899" dur="4.52">people we stop owning cars so it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="519.909" dur="6.15">not what level four is going to give us</text><text start="522.419" dur="8.511">and it was like very unclear how long</text><text start="526.059" dur="7.271">such a service will take to be better of</text><text start="530.93" dur="8.76">uber lyft public transportation in terms</text><text start="533.33" dur="9.57">of cost and practicality so what about</text><text start="539.69" dur="4.92">level five like I said I when I show the</text><text start="542.9" dur="4.23">slide before about the levels I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="544.61" dur="4.59">show any example of companies working on</text><text start="547.13" dur="3.33">level five because literally nobody is</text><text start="549.2" dur="3.33">working right now on level five it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="550.46" dur="4.17">very our problem those are two famous</text><text start="552.53" dur="5.13">quotes that I usually put in my</text><text start="554.63" dur="5.01">presentation one is from Iran in 2016 he</text><text start="557.66" dur="3.51">said that in about two years someone</text><text start="559.64"

dur="4.019">what&amp;#39;s interesting about I will show is</text><text start="687.97" dur="5.5">people spend five percent of the awake</text><text start="690.319" dur="6.21">time driving and while you drive you</text><text start="693.47" dur="4.5">pretty much take and one action of</text><text start="696.529" dur="3.12">compacting the gas core I think the</text><text start="697.97" dur="3.69">brake or correcting the steer pretty</text><text start="699.649" dur="4.29">much every second so if you dry for</text><text start="701.66" dur="4.979">about like 20 hours like three hours so</text><text start="703.939" dur="4.231">straight that&amp;#39;s about 10,000 single</text><text start="706.639" dur="5">intervention that you have to make to</text><text start="708.17" dur="5.94">your car and that&amp;#39;s actively stressful</text><text start="711.639" dur="5.531">another thing that is worth noticing is</text><text start="714.11" dur="5.729">that there have been last year to the</text><text start="717.17" dur="4.38">seven fatal accidents in the u.s. that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="719.839" dur="5.37">an increase of 15 percent from the</text><text start="721.55" dur="6.089">minimum reach in 2014 this is like quite</text><text start="725.209" dur="5.37">interesting because an unfortunate</text><text start="727.639" dur="5.82">because for many decades fatal accidents</text><text start="730.579" dur="4.921">in US have been going down the reason</text><text start="733.459" dur="4.23">why has been going up since 2014 is that</text><text start="735.5" dur="5.839">people are more distracted while driving</text><text start="737.689" dur="7.621">they look more therefore and</text><text start="741.339" dur="5.44">unfortunately this made more fatal</text><text start="745.31" dur="3.42">accidents and so there is really the</text><text start="746.779" dur="3.48">need of making sure that there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="748.73" dur="10.02">system monitoring the driver paying</text><text start="750.259" dur="11.25">attention so another very important</text><text start="758.75" dur="4.17">thing to know is and this is great if</text><text start="761.509" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;s a level 1 cache on today so</text><text start="762.92" dur="5.01">pretty much every New Castle today</text><text start="764.269" dur="6.3">already have the hardware to be a level</text><text start="767.93" dur="3.99">2 system to constitute to our level 2</text><text start="770.569" dur="2.94">system like if you think about every one</text><text start="771.92" dur="2.82">cars since they&amp;#39;re capable of</text><text start="773.509" dur="2.94">maintaining distance for the car in</text><text start="774.74"

ways of</text><text start="779.87" dur="6">controlling the gas the brake and the</text><text start="782.509" dur="4.8">steer and so those those actuator can</text><text start="785.87" dur="3.81">actually be controlled in a better way</text><text start="787.309" dur="5.041">not only to provide level 1 features but</text><text start="789.68" dur="4.2">actually level features the reason why</text><text start="792.35" dur="4.109">cars that we see on the market today</text><text start="793.88" dur="3.42">have only level 1 features and not level</text><text start="796.459" dur="3.601">2</text><text start="797.3" dur="4.2">piñon is because of cars are developed</text><text start="800.06" dur="3.6">with a very long development process</text><text start="801.5" dur="3.839">it&amp;#39;s not possible to make over-the-air</text><text start="803.66" dur="2.52">update in pretty much like every car on</text><text start="805.339" dur="6.601">the market today</text><text start="806.18" dur="7.71">except for Tesla and the car the car</text><text start="811.94" dur="4.5">like the arguer that makes your chassis</text><text start="813.89" dur="5.009">like your actuators is very integrated</text><text start="816.44" dur="4.2">with the arguer that makes your</text><text start="818.899" dur="3.69">computing and the software that comes</text><text start="820.64" dur="3.66">with the car and if you think about the</text><text start="822.589" dur="5.341">lifespan of a car average lifespan of a</text><text start="824.3" dur="5.34">car is 15 years think about how much</text><text start="827.93" dur="3.839">like computing and computers have</text><text start="829.64" dur="4.319">changed in 15 years so I do believe</text><text start="831.769" dur="4.861">there is this need to decouple the</text><text start="833.959" dur="5.551">armour of the cars like what was the</text><text start="836.63" dur="4.5">chasm was your actuators and was like</text><text start="839.51" dur="3.6">what makes the hour before you can from</text><text start="841.13" dur="4.8">your computing hardware which is what</text><text start="843.11" dur="9.57">actually makes your your</text><text start="845.93" dur="8.37">driver-assistance features so well in</text><text start="852.68" dur="3.659">order to the sky whatever to is we can</text><text start="854.3" dur="4.349">just look at the video this is this is</text><text start="856.339" dur="5.671">our system that we developed at comedy I</text><text start="858.649" dur="5.701">if you can see the system itself like</text><text start="862.01" dur="5.13">they are where is mounted on the</text><text start="864.35" dur="5.67">windshield it connects with the can</text><text start="867.14" dur="4.8">which is the communication system off of</text><text start="870.02" dur="5.52">the car and this is retrofitting a</text><text start="871.94" dur="5.76">level-one car which is a 2016 conceal so</text><text start="875.54" dur="4.41">how does a level-two system works well</text><text start="877.7" dur="4.889">so the idea is that you press a button</text><text start="879.95" dur="4.02">you engage and then the car handles</text><text start="882.589" dur="4.021">driving for you you have to pay</text><text start="883.97" dur="4.559">attention but the car will keep in the</text><text start="886.61" dur="4.02">lane will slow down will accelerate</text><text start="888.529" dur="3.601">depending on traffic conditions and</text><text start="890.63" dur="5.91">other information that they can gather</text><text start="892.13" dur="7.35">from the environment so it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="896.54" dur="4.62">different way of driving of course as</text><text start="899.48" dur="3.78">the system gets better it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="901.16" dur="4.32">important that the driver keeps paying</text><text start="903.26" dur="3.569">attention and so every level to system</text><text start="905.48" dur="3.03">as the level to system gets better it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="906.829" dur="4.141">very important to monitor the diver and</text><text start="908.51" dur="4.74">so in our system this is done by a</text><text start="910.97" dur="3.929">camera that is also watching the driver</text><text start="913.25" dur="3.75">so there are two cameras one looking at</text><text start="914.899" dur="8.101">the road and one watching the driver so</text><text start="917" dur="9.779">how does driver monitoring works so the</text><text start="923" dur="4.46">idea is that the camera is watching you</text><text start="926.779" dur="3.201">and</text><text start="927.46" dur="4.17">if you for example while driving you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="929.98" dur="3.87">being distracted so you&amp;#39;re looking away</text><text start="931.63" dur="3.75">from the Honda or for example you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="933.85" dur="3.239">falling asleep or anything the system</text><text start="935.38" dur="3.24">detects that you are not looking</text><text start="937.089" dur="3.331">straight then the system is gonna start</text><text start="938.62" dur="3.51">to alert you it&amp;#39;s going to start to beep</text><text start="940.42" dur="3.419">at you and then eventually if you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="942.13" dur="3.72">take control the system goes into a mode</text><text start="943.839" dur="3.841">where it&amp;#39;s gonna force you to disengage</text><text start="945.85" dur="5.81">the automated feature and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="947.68" dur="3.98">slowly bring down the car to a safe stop</text><text start="952.29" dur="6.25">so how does like self-driving car works</text><text start="957.1" dur="5.04">like before introducing and talking</text><text start="958.54" dur="5.97">about data let&amp;#39;s spend a few few words</text><text start="962.14" dur="5.639">about how an architecture or some</text><text start="964.51" dur="8.01">driving car is well you might have seen</text><text start="967.779" dur="7.231">this before it&amp;#39;s a very standard kind of</text><text start="972.52" dur="4.38">like layout of the system working in a</text><text start="975.01" dur="7.35">in a self-driving car but more in</text><text start="976.9" dur="7.86">general in manual bollix systems so you</text><text start="982.36" dur="5.28">have an initial like your input comes</text><text start="984.76" dur="5.55">from your sensors you use sensors to to</text><text start="987.64" dur="5.87">sense the world instead of in cars the</text><text start="990.31" dur="5.969">sensor typically cameras liders rather</text><text start="993.51" dur="7.72">ultrasonic sensors and all the sensor</text><text start="996.279" dur="7.821">that you use to perceive the state of</text><text start="1001.23" dur="7.68">the car itself like accelerometers</text><text start="1004.1" dur="7.09">gyroscopes and like magnetometer GPS to</text><text start="1008.91" dur="4.98">understand your positions and so once</text><text start="1011.19" dur="4.83">you have the data form from the sensor</text><text start="1013.89" dur="4.98">what you use them for well two things</text><text start="1016.02" dur="5.31">one is you localize yourself you</text><text start="1018.87" dur="4.35">localize yourself in in the world</text><text start="1021.33" dur="5.099">reference this is very important because</text><text start="1023.22" dur="4.979">well if you if you are working towards</text><text start="1026.429" dur="4.051">like a system with a car like drives</text><text start="1028.199" dur="7.081">itself it needs to be aware of your</text><text start="1030.48" dur="7.77">position to better Drive you why the</text><text start="1035.28" dur="6.24">system is active and it also uses the</text><text start="1038.25" dur="5.61">input from the sensor to make a semantic</text><text start="1041.52" dur="6.33">representation of the environment</text><text start="1043.86" dur="6.72">you go from a dense sensor output for</text><text start="1047.85" dur="5.64">example for cameras you have these like</text><text start="1050.58" dur="5.13">million of pixels in RGB format so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1053.49" dur="5.49">very dense it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s very high</text><text start="1055.71" dur="4.469">dimensional output to something that you</text><text start="1058.98" dur="3.99">compress</text><text start="1060.179" dur="4.74">and you extract information that then</text><text start="1062.97" dur="4.35">you need that people know how to</text><text start="1064.919" dur="5.941">interpret and then you need to keep</text><text start="1067.32" dur="5.16">going with your flow of operation so in</text><text start="1070.86" dur="4.37">to make some example in still driving</text><text start="1072.48" dur="5.1">cars so usually the the perception layer</text><text start="1075.23" dur="4.659">determines where lane lines are where</text><text start="1077.58" dur="4.62">cars are and we all the values obstacle</text><text start="1079.889" dur="5.311">on the road are so then you use this</text><text start="1082.2" dur="5.669">input to your next block which is called</text><text start="1085.2" dur="4.89">planning so once I know we&amp;#39;re like</text><text start="1087.869" dur="4.17">obstacle ours I understand my</text><text start="1090.09" dur="4.5">environment in a semantic way then I can</text><text start="1092.039" dur="6.75">plan for it I can generate a trajectory</text><text start="1094.59" dur="7.829">that I want the car to take once once I</text><text start="1098.789" dur="5.37">have the trajectory I actually have one</text><text start="1102.419" dur="4.26">last block which is called controls and</text><text start="1104.159" dur="4.23">if the block the heart weighs the car</text><text start="1106.679" dur="7.051">physically activates the car to make</text><text start="1108.389" dur="7.53">sure that the car follows your plan good</text><text start="1113.73" dur="4.049">news about the current state of</text><text start="1115.919" dur="3.33">self-driving cars and sensor</text><text start="1117.779" dur="4.26">localization this is already at</text><text start="1119.249" dur="4.321">superhuman level like you can put as</text><text start="1122.039" dur="3.36">many camera and as many sensor you want</text><text start="1123.57" dur="5.099">around the car you can have at any given</text><text start="1125.399" dur="5.22">instant perfectly under 60 view of your</text><text start="1128.669" dur="3.21">surrounding human of course have to turn</text><text start="1130.619" dur="3.81">their head and they you have to</text><text start="1131.879" dur="5.701">sacrifice some field of view while they</text><text start="1134.429" dur="4.411">are looking around in selling cars this</text><text start="1137.58" dur="4.5">is not necessary you can put as many</text><text start="1138.84" dur="6.539">sensors as you want and the localization</text><text start="1142.08" dur="6.63">is also super human I mean like for</text><text start="1145.379" dur="6.721">example like last year we drove around a</text><text start="1148.71" dur="6.599">closed track without using any any</text><text start="1152.1" dur="5.909">vision input just by using our GPS and</text><text start="1155.309" dur="5.36">doing a sensor fusion with with the</text><text start="1158.009" dur="4.86">sensor on the car like accelerometer and</text><text start="1160.669" dur="4.21">gyroscope and we were able to</text><text start="1162.869" dur="4.711">continuously loop around the track</text><text start="1164.879" dur="5.66">without having any sensor and we add</text><text start="1167.58" dur="6.539">like I would say probably a precision of</text><text start="1170.539" dur="5.86">less than one meter like less than three</text><text start="1174.119" dur="3.601">feet in place in understanding where the</text><text start="1176.399" dur="2.76">car using what the reference this is</text><text start="1177.72" dur="4.049">already superhuman like human of course</text><text start="1179.159" dur="6.781">don&amp;#39;t understand where they are in world</text><text start="1181.769" dur="5.64">reference which such accuracy controls</text><text start="1185.94" dur="4.679">are good enough</text><text start="1187.409" dur="6.421">they are definitely better than human</text><text start="1190.619" dur="3.481">when they work in their specific domain</text><text start="1193.83" dur="2.16">of</text><text start="1194.1" dur="5.1">operation where they have been developed</text><text start="1195.99" dur="4.98">for they don&amp;#39;t work or like they&amp;#39;re a</text><text start="1199.2" dur="3.63">little bit trickier to have them work as</text><text start="1200.97" dur="3.72">good as human when the condition</text><text start="1202.83" dur="3.93">suddenly changed so imagine that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1204.69" dur="5.31">driving and all a sudden you eat a bump</text><text start="1206.76" dur="4.47">or your steering gets misaligned well</text><text start="1210" dur="3.6">then you have to have a Largo a to</text><text start="1211.23" dur="5.13">understand that for you driving straight</text><text start="1213.6" dur="6.66">means applying a little steering on the</text><text start="1216.36" dur="5.37">side well so this is you have a lot of</text><text start="1220.26" dur="3.72">the situation that you need to handle</text><text start="1221.73" dur="4.61">and and you know the situation is a bit</text><text start="1223.98" dur="4.86">trickier and I think human can do these</text><text start="1226.34" dur="5.55">currently better than machines so</text><text start="1228.84" dur="5.91">adapting to sudden change of your model</text><text start="1231.89" dur="4.09">but I I think what Russ I could</text><text start="1234.75" dur="2.22">definitely like pros and cons with</text><text start="1235.98" dur="2.85">respect to human and they are good</text><text start="1236.97" dur="4.29">enough it&amp;#39;s now resorting back to</text><text start="1238.83" dur="5.4">driving cars the thing that are like</text><text start="1241.26" dur="4.62">highly subhuman human do better than</text><text start="1244.23" dur="3.39">machines is a sense of fusion and</text><text start="1245.88" dur="3.36">perception implanting suspicion</text><text start="1247.62" dur="2.939">perception like understanding the</text><text start="1249.24" dur="3.929">semantic representation of the world</text><text start="1250.559" dur="4.5">human are better these typical examples</text><text start="1253.169" dur="3.811">there is a long tail of events where</text><text start="1255.059" dur="4.561">shell driving car have a little bit hard</text><text start="1256.98" dur="5.4">time handling them so imagine like you</text><text start="1259.62" dur="5.039">see a plastic bag tumbling on the road</text><text start="1262.38" dur="4.679">well so that I mean car might recognize</text><text start="1264.659" dur="4.111">that there is like an obstacle but then</text><text start="1267.059" dur="2.911">you have to decide is this something</text><text start="1268.77" dur="3">that I can eat or is this something that</text><text start="1269.97" dur="3.3">I should break for and this decision</text><text start="1271.77" dur="4.76">becomes very important if you&amp;#39;re driving</text><text

dur="4.8">before it has more to do with skills</text><text start="1287.73" dur="3.9">that not necessarily people have learned</text><text start="1289.74" dur="3.27">from from driving but things that they</text><text start="1291.63" dur="4.47">just understand they have some sort of</text><text start="1293.01" dur="5.549">like intuition about the physics of the</text><text start="1296.1" dur="4.74">world they just apply and they generate</text><text start="1298.559" dur="7.531">those trajectory and it&amp;#39;s very are the</text><text start="1300.84" dur="6.9">creating algorithms at the base so maybe</text><text start="1306.09" dur="6">a better approach which is what we are</text><text start="1307.74" dur="7.559">torturing at , is putting together and</text><text start="1312.09" dur="5.76">try to solve at once sensor fusion</text><text start="1315.299" dur="4.051">perception planning all some sort of</text><text start="1317.85" dur="3.9">like more like an end-to-end approach</text><text start="1319.35" dur="4.97">and I think this is gonna scale better</text><text start="1321.75" dur="5.63">than trying to separate these two blocks</text><text start="1324.32" dur="4.729">so what are they</text><text start="1327.38" dur="5.94">useful for well that are useful for</text><text start="1329.049" dur="5.981">improving those those two blocks because</text><text start="1333.32" dur="5.4">they do need machine learning a machine</text><text start="1335.03" dur="6.12">learning can work with with data so</text><text start="1338.72" dur="6.63">let&amp;#39;s talk about data why are they</text><text start="1341.15" dur="6.21">important in in cell driving cars well</text><text start="1345.35" dur="4.199">of course first first thing is to train</text><text

like connectivity in Casta</text><text start="1602.08" dur="4.11">you have these devices that collect your</text><text start="1603.909" dur="4.051">data how do you get data back well if</text><text

basically can can stream</text><text start="1614.23" dur="5.34">back the data using like physical</text><text start="1616.869" dur="5.04">connection but for our distributed</text><text start="1619.57"

through</text><text start="1625.299" dur="4.2">cellular connection so a connection is a</text><text start="1627.369" dur="5.221">cost and so these must be considered</text><text start="1629.499" dur="7.731">when you when you when you stream back</text><text start="1632.59" dur="7.289">data to to your database data center</text><text start="1637.23" dur="8.26">other thing that has cost if you

dur="5.73">picture and telling and like taking</text><text start="1665.499" dur="3.841">notes wearing the picture of things are</text><text start="1667.509" dur="4.11">what everything in the picture is in</text><text start="1669.34" dur="8.279">this case where cars are where orders</text><text start="1671.619" dur="8.76">lane lines buildings etc will come move</text><text start="1677.619" dur="5.4">completely away from human labeling and</text><text start="1680.379" dur="7.111">we try to do everything automated so we</text><text start="1683.019" dur="8.12">use neural networks to label

start="1695.409" dur="4.831">pay for is of course processing training</text><text start="1698.47" dur="4.02">and data transfer if you have your data</text><text start="1700.24" dur="5.73">stored on

start="1708.19" dur="6.959">electricity to train your data because</text><text start="1710.95" dur="5.64">they run on GPUs and you do Spanos data</text><text start="1715.149" dur="2.64">for data

start="1719.799" dur="6.421">eventual if you want to train luckily</text><text start="1721.179" dur="6.75">and this also has a cost and probably</text><text start="1726.22" dur="5.52">the most important thing is the cost of</text><text start="1727.929" dur="7.08">storage the data one thing that a camera</text><text start="1731.74" dur="6.869">we quickly realized is as the number of</text><text start="1735.009" dur="5.821">users that we have keeps growing we saw</text><text start="1738.609" dur="4.77">that I really like steep increase in</text><text start="1740.83" dur="4.799">storage cost if you think about it and</text><text start="1743.379" dur="4.561">if you assume that the number of users</text><text start="1745.629" dur="6.061">that you have it&amp;#39;s sort of like growing</text><text start="1747.94" dur="6.929">linearly over over time well think about</text><text start="1751.69" dur="7.65">how much storing their data indefinitely</text><text start="1754.869" dur="7.321">is going to cost you I mean generally if</text><text start="1759.34" dur="6.419">your function of user increase is called</text><text start="1762.19" dur="5.729">f of X where X is your time well they</text><text start="1765.759" dur="6.451">can&amp;#39;t the cost of storing their data is</text><text start="1767.919" dur="6.781">the integral of of f of X because

dur="4.2">your business model is in the case of</text><text start="1779.769" dur="4.5">the driving cars where data are</text><text start="1781.359" dur="5.881">particularly expensive because in

some tips about that data storage</text><text start="1818.769" dur="5.91">and use of data I think unless you have</text><text start="1821.619" dur="5.461">as I said before like a lot of lot of</text><text start="1824.679" dur="4.801">money people are invested money on you</text><text start="1827.08" dur="5.429">and you can build your own fleet and you</text><text start="1829.48"

very similar to what what</text><text start="2196.5" dur="3.15">you described when they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text><text start="2197.49" dur="4.14">applied I think a lot of it will be</text><text

dur="4.859">entertainment to the driver I mean we</text><text start="2208.74" dur="4.17">start to see maybe I mean we see a</text><text start="2210.359" dur="5.25">little bit of these like in cats when</text><text start="2212.91" dur="5.49">you take a taxi you have some taxi you</text><text start="2215.609" dur="5.371">have like like you can watch a video in</text><text start="2218.4"

out like the technology</text><text start="2248.55" dur="3.84">progressed and I do believe that cars</text><text start="2250.47" dur="5.149">are going to be optimized around the</text><text

dur="3.78">vehicles let&amp;#39;s talk about let&amp;#39;s start</text><text start="2324.39" dur="3.12">out with definitions just level set and</text><text start="2326.16" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m sure some of y&amp;#39;all were at this</text><text start="2327.51" dur="5.1">session this morning but for the</text><text start="2329.22" dur="5.58">newcomers yeah I think a good way as I</text><text start="2332.61" dur="3.69">mentioned we have any presentation for</text><text start="2334.8" dur="2.73">the people that we rank here for the</text><text start="2336.3" dur="4.4">presentation it&amp;#39;s important to</text><text start="2337.53" dur="6.36">distinguish between levels of automation</text><text start="2340.7" dur="7.39">the sae defines the five different</text><text start="2343.89" dur="8.19">levels level 1 2 3 4 and 5 and level 1</text><text start="2348.09" dur="5.79">is pretty much like the car some assist</text><text start="2352.08" dur="4.68">the driver so the driver drives all the</text><text start="2353.88" dur="5.67">time but the car make makes intervention</text><text start="2356.76" dur="5.49">and makes driving safer and easier in</text><text start="2359.55" dur="4.26">level 2 because the car is full in</text><text start="2362.25" dur="4.38">control of driving and the driver</text><text start="2363.81" dur="5.79">actually assists the car and an example</text><text start="2366.63" dur="6.36">is Tesla Tesla vehicle GM supercruise</text><text start="2369.6" dur="6.63">and what we develop a comet the eye and</text><text start="2372.99" dur="4.77">then from level 3 and above the driver</text><text start="2376.23" dur="3.96">is not responsible anymore</text><text start="2377.76" dur="4.05">the car is responsible for for the</text><text start="2380.19" dur="3.21">driving actions so the driver is not</text><text start="2381.81" dur="4.71">required to pay attention at all time</text><text start="2383.4" dur="4.92">with level 3 the driver is only required</text><text start="2386.52" dur="3.6">to take control of the car after a few</text><text start="2388.32" dur="3.06">seconds of safe operation of the vehicle</text><text start="2390.12" dur="4.23">when the vehicle encounters a situation</text><text start="2391.38" dur="5.4">that cannot handle and then for 11 4 &amp;amp; 5</text><text start="2394.35" dur="5.4">is driver is completely driverless</text><text start="2396.78" dur="6.06">vehicle and in level 4 is limited</text><text start="2399.75" dur="5.76">environment in level 5 is full full</text><text start="2402.84" dur="4.59">automation in unlimited environments so</text><text start="2405.51" dur="11.97">basically making a robot that can drive</text><text start="2407.43" dur="12.15">as good as a human when when are they</text><text start="2417.48" dur="4.22">coming into the market yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2419.58" dur="4.89">a good question and the answer is</text><text start="2421.7" dur="7.18">certain certain levels of automation</text><text start="2424.47" dur="6.18">already here level level 1 is what you</text><text start="2428.88" dur="2.91">buy today if you buy a new car and in</text><text start="2430.65" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re on the new to your author like</text><text start="2431.79" dur="5.07">the most popular cars have 11:1</text><text start="2434.1" dur="5.23">automation a few cars on the market and</text><text start="2436.86" dur="5.4">represent about the 0.2 percent</text><text start="2439.33" dur="7.89">the fleet today in us are level two</text><text start="2442.26" dur="9.79">mainly our test autopilot and then there</text><text start="2447.22" dur="7.8">is no like release the car in u.s. that</text><text start="2452.05" dur="5.73">is like level 3 or above and so when</text><text start="2455.02" dur="5.07">when are those car comings when I would</text><text start="2457.78" dur="3.81">say first we should we should try to</text><text start="2460.09" dur="3.75">increase the number of cars on sublevel</text><text start="2461.59" dur="4.08">2 how do we make the existing cars like</text><text start="2463.84" dur="3.92">smarter how do we how do we make the</text><text start="2465.67" dur="3.84">fleet how do we change the fleet</text><text start="2467.76" dur="4.27">incremental ii and i would say the</text><text start="2469.51" dur="4.68">natural like way that it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="2472.03" dur="5.64">change is cars are gonna transition from</text><text start="2474.19" dur="5.52">level 1 to level 2 and then when level 4</text><text start="2477.67" dur="3.54">level 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 are gonna be applied well</text><text start="2479.71" dur="3.72">I would say like I would said before in</text><text start="2481.21" dur="3.72">the presentation I think one interesting</text><text start="2483.43" dur="3.69">level that we should be paying attention</text><text start="2484.93" dur="4.11">to is level 4 level 3 does not make much</text><text start="2487.12" dur="3.48">sense because solving for level 3 is</text><text start="2489.04" dur="4.44">pretty much as I have a solving for</text><text start="2490.6" dur="6.06">level 4 guaranteeing this certain amount</text><text start="2493.48" dur="4.86">of time of safe operation it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2496.66" dur="4.02">not simple task and solving for that is</text><text start="2498.34" dur="4.41">as our in my opinion solving for level 4</text><text start="2500.68" dur="3.54">so what what we are going to see at</text><text start="2502.75" dur="3.36">certain points is the deployment of</text><text start="2504.22" dur="5.34">fleets that work in limited environment</text><text start="2506.11" dur="5.22">and with driverless vehicles that can</text><text start="2509.56" dur="5.06">bring you to point A to point B so</text><text start="2511.33" dur="7.92">hopefully we are going to see that in</text><text start="2514.62" dur="8.17">the near future but these level 4 does</text><text start="2519.25" dur="5.79">not compete with level 2 level 4 what</text><text start="2522.79" dur="6">level 4 aims to is the replacement of</text><text start="2525.04" dur="6.54">existing services such as uber such as</text><text start="2528.79" dur="5.31">Poli transportation is just meant to</text><text start="2531.58" dur="8.12">make those services cheaper by removing</text><text start="2534.1" dur="8.52">the driver from from the loop conference</text><text start="2539.7" dur="4.57">I work in the automotive aftermarket and</text><text start="2542.62" dur="3.69">one of the things I do is I watch the</text><text start="2544.27" dur="4.35">car park and watch how it&amp;#39;s changing and</text><text start="2546.31" dur="4.49">and how it&amp;#39;s gonna be changing the next</text><text start="2548.62" dur="7.32">15 20 years to keep my company</text><text start="2550.8" dur="6.76">competitive so when I thought so od BC</text><text start="2555.94" dur="3.36">connectors oh we need two connectors</text><text start="2557.56" dur="3.51">those are the little you stick something</text><text start="2559.3" dur="6.84">under your dash used a lot for some</text><text start="2561.07" dur="6.749">basic diagnostic functions that that</text><text start="2566.14" dur="3.719">it&amp;#39;s not smart enough that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="2567.819" dur="5.371">connected and the right way to make it</text><text start="2569.859" dur="6.361">make my dumb car into a level 2 car no</text><text start="2573.19" dur="5.94">yeah so what we do at karma and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2576.22" dur="5.099">taking existing car so so proving that</text><text start="2579.13" dur="4.469">level 2 technology can be applied to</text><text start="2581.319" dur="5.401">existing cars you can take any new cars</text><text start="2583.599" dur="4.351">to tell level 1 capability and we prove</text><text start="2586.72" dur="2.879">the individual that I showed you a</text><text start="2587.95" dur="5.25">representation that you can actually</text><text start="2589.599" dur="5.911">turn it into a level 2 car because a car</text><text start="2593.2" dur="5.609">that are new and comes out today have</text><text start="2595.51" dur="4.71">already backed waiters and a way of</text><text start="2598.809" dur="4.171">communicating of controlling that</text><text start="2600.22" dur="5.97">waiters such as gas brake and steering</text><text start="2602.98" dur="5.52">in a way that you can actually have the</text><text start="2606.19" dur="3.99">car driving itself if it is marked</text><text start="2608.5" dur="5.789">enough it has the right software and</text><text start="2610.18" dur="7.26">then I compute so yeah I mean like if</text><text start="2614.289" dur="7.23">you the way that you interact with the</text><text start="2617.44" dur="6.389">car is tapping into the can system of</text><text start="2621.519" dur="5.191">the car and it can be done through video</text><text start="2623.829" dur="7.651">pores or it can be done from any under</text><text start="2626.71" dur="10.2">and present in the car the technology</text><text start="2631.48" dur="7.5">needed to really hit the level 2016 well</text><text start="2636.91" dur="3.689">you eat the you need to do you need</text><text start="2638.98" dur="3.569">actuators you need they are the weather</text><text start="2640.599" dur="4.831">comes with the car be ready to be to be</text><text start="2642.549" dur="6.8">upgraded basically so you need pretty</text><text start="2645.43" dur="8.099">much like a new car so from 2016 above</text><text start="2649.349" dur="5.74">but really in 2019 almost an in your car</text><text start="2653.529" dur="3.24">could be could be retrofitted way to</text><text start="2655.089" dur="3.391">meet a level 2 in theory does anybody</text><text start="2656.769" dur="5.941">want to guess what percentage of the car</text><text start="2658.48" dur="10.26">park is 2016 and above anybody who&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2662.71" dur="9.72">brave you&amp;#39;re pretty close it&amp;#39;s 20% so</text><text start="2668.74" dur="5.339">that also means that right now we have a</text><text start="2672.43" dur="4.32">lot of dumb cars on the road that won&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2674.079" dur="4.74">be able to have the full benefit of you</text><text start="2676.75" dur="4.109">know some aftermarket accessories</text><text start="2678.819" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s still some programming you can</text><text start="2680.859" dur="6.061">do through there&amp;#39;s lots of obd2 port</text><text start="2683.259" dur="5.34">platforms so for the novice car person</text><text start="2686.92" dur="4.56">who knows just enough Python to get in</text><text start="2688.599" dur="5.01">trouble and github x&amp;#39; that can help you</text><text start="2691.48" dur="4.5">get there but it doesn&amp;#39;t take it quite</text><text start="2693.609" dur="4.831">to where it&amp;#39;s the driver assist and have</text><text start="2695.98" dur="4.5">the functionality to</text><text start="2698.44" dur="3.629">if you want the car to actually be</text><text start="2700.48" dur="3.18">driving itself you need you need</text><text start="2702.069" dur="6.061">basically access to to that to eight</text><text start="2703.66" dur="6.99">hours so the age of the vehicles is</text><text start="2708.13" dur="4.02">another thing that age of the car park</text><text start="2710.65" dur="2.459">has been something interesting that</text><text start="2712.15" dur="2.429">people in the aftermarket have been</text><text start="2713.109" dur="3.541">watching because people are holding on</text><text start="2714.579" dur="4.441">to cars way longer</text><text start="2716.65" dur="5.939">in 1996 the average age of the car who</text><text start="2719.02" dur="5.099">is eight point five years and you had</text><text start="2722.589" dur="4.111">you had it on the slide earlier just in</text><text start="2724.119" dur="5.611">the the current age according to IHS of</text><text start="2726.7" dur="5.52">an average car in America is eleven</text><text start="2729.73" dur="5.73">point seven years and it&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="2732.22" dur="6.149">predicting to increase even when there</text><text start="2735.46" dur="5.55">have been movements like the cars cash</text><text start="2738.369" dur="4.47">for cars that only took six hundred and</text><text start="2741.01"

have is getting around</text><text start="2747.4" dur="5.79">those dumb cars well so definitely those</text><text start="2751.119" dur="4.801">cars those cars like are gonna be around</text><text start="2753.19" dur="5.28">for a long time and it&amp;#39;s highlighting</text><text start="2755.92" dur="4.71">one important fact that is if the</text><text start="2758.47" dur="3.78">average life of

except for Tesla is capable of</text><text start="2794.109" dur="4.531">doing it but I&amp;#39;m also talking about like</text><text start="2797.17" dur="4.83">being able to replace the

this car has been like so big</text><text start="2810.849" dur="3.93">like still has four wheels they cost</text><text start="2813.52" dur="4.44">pretty much about the same amount of</text><text start="2814.779" dur="6.06">money and they serve pretty much the</text><text start="2817.96" dur="6.389">same purpose what&amp;#39;s changed is the cost</text><text start="2820.839" dur="5.22">of

that it was 15 years ago and so if</text><text start="2835.19" dur="3.78">you think about it well why I think</text><text start="2837.44" dur="3.84">about cars that you buy today and think</text><text start="2838.97" dur="5.22">about them in 15 years from now how</text><text start="2841.28" dur="4.86">outdated they will feel an analogy that</text><text start="2844.19" dur="4.47">I make it&amp;#39;s

dur="4.32">that can work with your existing car and</text><text start="2865.1" dur="3.45">you treat it as a consumer electronic</text><text start="2867.14" dur="3.12">you treat that device that you

dur="3.9">after maybe every two years when a new</text><text start="2874.34" dur="3.9">system comes out you can replace it</text><text start="2876.17" dur="4.29">there is there is really no reason

dur="3.99">also what we&amp;#39;re seeing partnerships</text><text start="2885.05" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing large autumn automobile</text><text start="2887.48" dur="3.51">manufacturers partner

about data</text><text start="2924.8" dur="10.26">collection is there how did how data</text><text start="2930.92" dur="6.63">collection using your tools so is that a</text><text start="2935.06"

think the</text><text start="2954.23" dur="4.49">distinction needs to be made between</text><text start="2955.43" dur="6.3">data collection that is made through</text><text start="2958.72" dur="4.39">like devices and product that are</text><text start="2961.73" dur="2.19">current results so if you work on level</text><text start="2963.11" dur="2.64">two like for example</text><text start="2963.92" dur="4.56">Tesla tells us the ability of collecting</text><text start="2965.75" dur="4.26">everyday 4 million miles like they have</text><text start="2968.48" dur="5.129">enough car that everyday they can</text><text start="2970.01" dur="5.789">collect 4 million Minds a comma we are</text><text start="2973.609" dur="5.281">we are about thirty thousand miles per</text><text start="2975.799" dur="5.04">day that we can collect and so if you</text><text start="2978.89" dur="3.81">have a product that you actually sell it</text><text start="2980.839" dur="5.22">becomes a lot easier to collect the data</text><text start="2982.7" dur="4.919">and you can actually be a little bit</text><text start="2986.059" dur="2.071">spoiled by the amount of data that you</text><text start="2987.619" dur="2.641">can collect</text><text start="2988.13" dur="3.6">you can select you can decide which data</text><text start="2990.26" dur="3.15">to upload that you don&amp;#39;t need to upload</text><text start="2991.73" dur="3.629">all the data definitely test is not</text><text start="2993.41" dur="5.159">uploading four million lines of data</text><text start="2995.359" dur="4.651">every day so if you work on like level</text><text start="2998.569" dur="5.611">tree evolve on something that has not</text><text start="3000.01" dur="6.599">been released yet to the public then you</text><text start="3004.18" dur="4.05">cannot collect this data from from</text><text start="3006.609" dur="4.021">people from your device that are out in</text><text start="3008.23" dur="5.97">the field but it&amp;#39;s also important to</text><text start="3010.63" dur="5.85">distinguish between which type of data</text><text start="3014.2" dur="3.839">you can collect from people just driving</text><text start="3016.48" dur="4.65">a car which type of data you actually</text><text start="3018.039" dur="5.101">need from the car that you prepare that</text><text start="3021.13" dur="6.209">are driving themselves so think about</text><text start="3023.14" dur="7.05">like a fleet of driving car like level 4</text><text start="3027.339" dur="5.611">well like if you are trying to learn to</text><text start="3030.19" dur="6.27">drive on data you can you can gather</text><text start="3032.95" dur="4.889">this data from simply like people</text><text start="3036.46" dur="2.879">driving around they don&amp;#39;t need to be</text><text start="3037.839" dur="2.851">driving with your own car you need to</text><text start="3039.339" dur="3.631">make sure that they have enough sensor</text><text start="3040.69" dur="4.169">and the sensor representative off of the</text><text start="3042.97" dur="4.26">car that you plant eventually to Elise</text><text start="3044.859" dur="3.9">for your for your final system but you</text><text start="3047.23" dur="2.91">can distinguish between your fleet that</text><text start="3048.759" dur="2.901">you use for testing to test your</text><text start="3050.14" dur="4.469">algorithm it that are driving themselves</text><text start="3051.66" dur="4.72">versus the fleet that you just used for</text><text start="3054.609" dur="3.44">data collection so even if you are like</text><text start="3056.38" dur="3.87">working level for example in tracking</text><text start="3058.049" dur="3.701">you don&amp;#39;t need to have like self-driving</text><text start="3060.25" dur="3.089">tracking on the old in order to be able</text><text start="3061.75" dur="3.839">to collect data from tracking you can</text><text start="3063.339" dur="4.02">like retrofit existing tracking with the</text><text start="3065.589" dur="3.841">right sensors and learn how to drive</text><text start="3067.359" dur="5.7">from manual from people that are</text><text start="3069.43" dur="5.369">actually driving just to stocks so yeah</text><text start="3073.059" dur="4.171">I think doing that distinction could</text><text start="3074.799" dur="5.371">help like getting into like the segment</text><text start="3077.23" dur="6.569">where it&amp;#39;s a little are them to be like</text><text start="3080.17" dur="6.21">big big networks and there&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ve seen</text><text start="3083.799" dur="4.641">automation go into agriculture first and</text><text start="3086.38" dur="4.79">see having a large area you know</text><text start="3088.44" dur="4.32">good opportunity for development know</text><text start="3091.17" dur="4.86">some software stuff is so needs to get</text><text start="3092.76" dur="7.88">worked out yes right to repair culture</text><text start="3096.03" dur="7.59">is a great example of automation that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3100.64" dur="5.43">easier than driving because the safety</text><text start="3103.62" dur="4.95">aspect of it is not is not like Samantha</text><text start="3106.07" dur="8.17">but it&amp;#39;s a good example yeah how</text><text start="3108.57" dur="8.34">automation works and then we talked for</text><text start="3114.24" dur="3.78">the last few days about having the right</text><text start="3116.91" dur="3.69">kind of sample set</text><text start="3118.02" dur="3.87">how different are the videos and how</text><text start="3120.6" dur="3.24">applicable are the models from the</text><text start="3121.89" dur="3.48">different driving style so people in New</text><text start="3123.84" dur="4.23">York Drive very different than people</text><text start="3125.37" dur="6.81">here places like Georgia we have the</text><text start="3128.07" dur="8.64">long commute like Houston so what is</text><text start="3132.18" dur="7.38">their prioritization yeah that&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="3136.71" dur="5.1">question so for level two like for what</text><text start="3139.56" dur="3.75">we do I mean with more variety we get</text><text start="3141.81" dur="3.57">from data the better we try to be the</text><text start="3143.31" dur="3.86">system is somewhat works decently in</text><text start="3145.38" dur="4.47">pretty much like every driving condition</text><text start="3147.17" dur="5.05">if you try to build something like a</text><text start="3149.85" dur="4.77">fleet of level 4 vehicles I think you</text><text start="3152.22" dur="5.58">should focus on your first application</text><text start="3154.62" dur="4.8">so if your first application is a system</text><text start="3157.8" dur="3.48">that is going to service people like in</text><text start="3159.42" dur="3.96">a suburban place where like speed is</text><text start="3161.28" dur="6.21">limited maybe like to 30 miles per 30 5</text><text start="3163.38" dur="6.51">miles per hour and like there is not</text><text start="3167.49" dur="4.05">like huge traffic then maybe you should</text><text start="3169.89" dur="3.69">like focus on collecting data from those</text><text start="3171.54" dur="4.71">aisles because those represent your</text><text start="3173.58" dur="5.28">first like go to market application and</text><text start="3176.25" dur="5.49">you shouldn&amp;#39;t try to some sort of like</text><text start="3178.86" dur="5.25">mixing with data that&amp;#39;s coming from</text><text start="3181.74" dur="4.89">environment that are outside the scope</text><text start="3184.11" dur="5.1">of the first release of your product so</text><text start="3186.63" dur="3.78">it really depends I would say like if</text><text start="3189.21" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re focusing a level for now don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3190.41" dur="4.68">trying to get data from New York try to</text><text start="3193.5" dur="3.12">try to focus on where where you&amp;#39;re gonna</text><text start="3195.09" dur="3.45">have your first application and it&amp;#39;s now</text><text start="3196.62" dur="3.72">going to be New York and we&amp;#39;d also</text><text start="3198.54" dur="4.2">talked about the applicability of car</text><text start="3200.34" dur="4.95">videos being used for like larger Class</text><text start="3202.74" dur="4.14">eight vehicles you know camera it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3205.29" dur="5.13">going to look different even for your</text><text start="3206.88" dur="4.95">modeling so that&amp;#39;s a good thing there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3210.42" dur="3.39">a lot of data out there and micro</text><text start="3211.83" dur="3.9">processors have gotten cheap super</text><text start="3213.81" dur="2.69">although your cloud storage bill might</text><text start="3215.73" dur="5.06">go up a bit</text><text start="3216.5" dur="8.55">yes definitely like due to the sensors</text><text start="3220.79" dur="5.37">i&amp;#39;ve super each output like a cameras</text><text start="3225.05" dur="1.71">like you think about the stream of</text><text start="3226.16" dur="3.959">camera</text><text start="3226.76" dur="5.309">it&amp;#39;s like mega mega mega pixels and so</text><text start="3230.119" dur="4.23">think about how much data that is sure</text><text start="3232.069" dur="4.231">you can compress your video but still</text><text start="3234.349" dur="5.821">like we are talking about i mean in our</text><text start="3236.3" dur="6.9">case like our device collects pretty</text><text start="3240.17" dur="5.46">much between 5 and gigabytes of data per</text><text start="3243.2" dur="3.48">hour if you talk about like level 4 you</text><text start="3245.63" dur="3.87">are probably talking about like a</text><text start="3246.68" dur="5.639">gigabyte per hour collected by your</text><text start="3249.5" dur="5.7">system and so yes I mean like processing</text><text start="3252.319" dur="6.451">this data becomes like feasible now on</text><text start="3255.2" dur="4.71">like real time but at the same time if</text><text start="3258.77" dur="3.329">you&amp;#39;re storing this data you have to</text><text start="3259.91" dur="4.77">think about how expensive is going to be</text><text start="3262.099" dur="4.831">your your storage bill when you are like</text><text start="3264.68" dur="6.45">uploading all these data to your to your</text><text start="3266.93" dur="6.48">servers you know how can you know if</text><text start="3271.13" dur="5.03">you&amp;#39;re interested in in working with you</text><text start="3273.41" dur="5.459">know autonomous vehicles and car tech</text><text start="3276.16" dur="4.51">the the problem presents a good</text><text start="3278.869" dur="4.71">opportunity for developing new models</text><text start="3280.67" dur="4.5">for we saw some models for that the our</text><text start="3283.579" dur="4.611">CNN with picture refinement and</text><text start="3285.17" dur="5.64">different ways to classify images so</text><text start="3288.19" dur="5.44">you&amp;#39;re closer to it so you know how are</text><text start="3290.81" dur="4.2">different ways to get in to be involved</text><text start="3293.63" dur="3.9">or the other development opportunities</text><text start="3295.01" dur="7.02">that aren&amp;#39;t necessarily in the card type</text><text start="3297.53" dur="7.14">you know yeah well so self-driving cars</text><text start="3302.03" dur="7.049">are mainly like a software problem it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3304.67" dur="6.87">not really a problem that has been some</text><text start="3309.079" dur="4.801">sort of like I see solved I and I see it</text><text start="3311.54" dur="4.23">like I really frame it as a software as</text><text start="3313.88" dur="4.86">a possible problem how do we how do we</text><text start="3315.77" dur="5.01">make like a robot that they can drive as</text><text start="3318.74" dur="4.56">human or can at least like assist human</text><text start="3320.78" dur="5.19">driving so yeah you don&amp;#39;t need to be</text><text start="3323.3" dur="4.95">caressed better to be involved you need</text><text start="3325.97" dur="4.41">amino free to have like passion for for</text><text start="3328.25" dur="4.46">software and that there are like many</text><text start="3330.38" dur="4.53">aspects of it you can you can work on</text><text start="3332.71" dur="4.06">machine learning

all our software it&amp;#39;s open</text><text start="3354.02" dur="4.32">source like comedy I makes all the</text><text start="3356.36" dur="4.98">software open source it&amp;#39;s called

start="3435.56" dur="3.72">vehicle is that they respected like</text><text start="3437.63" dur="3.9">utility sure it is gonna be much higher</text><text start="3439.28" dur="3.69">than any of the car existing which we</text><text start="3441.53" dur="4.68">really think about like the trucking</text><text start="3442.97" dur="6.15">industry the trucking industry when when</text><text start="3446.21" dur="3.36">we are gonna see 11 4 trucks on their</text><text start="3449.12" dur="2.04">order</text><text start="3449.57" dur="3.12">well tracking is going to become like</text><text start="3451.16" dur="2.82">radically different because you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="3452.69" dur="3.24">gonna be any more constrained by the</text><text start="3453.98" dur="4.29">maximum I think it&amp;#39;s eight hours like</text><text start="3455.93" dur="4.32">maximum continues driving from from</text><text start="3458.27" dur="3.75">driver so you can have those trucks like</text><text start="3460.25" dur="4.65">driving pretty much like no staff but</text><text start="3462.02" dur="6.45">for for as long as it takes to go from</text><text start="3464.9" dur="6.39">point A to point B and so yeah certain</text><text start="3468.47" dur="4.65">industries and I really look forward to</text><text start="3471.29" dur="3.84">tracking industries are gonna be</text><text start="3473.12" dur="4.5">radically changed by a for example you</text><text start="3475.13" dur="5.69">to musicians right other things are</text><text start="3477.62" dur="4.28">gonna change I would expect like</text><text start="3480.82" dur="4.62">the first application I&amp;#39;ll add before</text><text start="3481.9" dur="6.6">being I there is gonna be a company that</text><text start="3485.44" dur="3.84">owns the fleet like I do really see</text><text start="3488.5" dur="1.98">especially because at the beginning</text><text start="3489.28" dur="2.79">there is gonna be a lot of like</text><text start="3490.48" dur="3.33">iterations like on they are on the</text><text start="3492.07" dur="4.08">services of the maintenance there are a</text><text start="3493.81" dur="4.29">lot of like unknowns and so I do see</text><text start="3496.15" dur="5.85">making sense that there is gonna be like</text><text start="3498.1" dur="6.15">a company that owns the fleet as opposed</text><text start="3502" dur="4.32">a little as opposed to what we see today</text><text start="3504.25" dur="4.83">with uber drivers where it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="3506.32" dur="4.71">distributed single drivers that own</text><text start="3509.08" dur="4.56">their car and contribute to the fleet</text><text start="3511.03" dur="4.89">instead I rather see those fleet being</text><text start="3513.64" dur="4.31">directly managed and central is the by</text><text start="3515.92" dur="5.43">the company that provides the service</text><text start="3517.95" dur="6.76">and it&amp;#39;s upgrading is a bigger deal with</text><text start="3521.35" dur="5.97">the these smarter cars getting software</text><text start="3524.71" dur="4.86">updates and good have to happen fleet</text><text start="3527.32" dur="4.14">management makes more sense and that can</text><text start="3529.57" dur="4.65">make a lot of sense in that context yeah</text><text start="3531.46" dur="5.22">exactly what I was mentioning like there</text><text start="3534.22" dur="4.02">is this need of being like closely</text><text start="3536.68" dur="3.99">connected with your fleet being able to</text><text start="3538.24" dur="4.44">upgrade your car so and especially like</text><text start="3540.67" dur="3.15">at the beginning so definitely it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3542.68" dur="5.88">gonna be like the first implementation</text><text start="3543.82" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s gonna be like our own fleet does</text><text start="3548.56" dur="4.38">anybody know the utilization rate for a</text><text start="3550.57" dur="3.84">consumer car unless you&amp;#39;re like an uber</text><text start="3552.94" dur="3.78">driver because that&amp;#39;s or you know in</text><text start="3554.41" dur="4.32">your car yeah I&amp;#39;ve heard you end up not</text><text start="3556.72" dur="4.38">using your car its parts around 90</text><text start="3558.73" dur="4.02">percent of the time whereas you can kind</text><text start="3561.1" dur="6.03">of flip that model with an autonomous</text><text start="3562.75" dur="5.82">vehicle in delivery services you can</text><text start="3567.13" dur="2.79">have like at last mile issues you</text><text start="3568.57" dur="3.75">actually might need to have a human</text><text start="3569.92" dur="4.32">doing some interaction but again you</text><text start="3572.32" dur="3.48">know looking for ways you can interact</text><text start="3574.24" dur="4.59">with this new vendor industry that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3575.8" dur="4.23">that is something if there&amp;#39;s not a</text><text start="3578.83" dur="2.61">driver in the car how would your</text><text start="3580.03" dur="4.47">business work with them and serve them</text><text start="3581.44" dur="7.17">so would that change anything any aspect</text><text start="3584.5" dur="10.86">of what you&amp;#39;re doing now let&amp;#39;s see how</text><text start="3588.61" dur="9.09">about consumer adoption of babies well</text><text start="3595.36" dur="4.26">so okay if we talk about level two it</text><text start="3597.7" dur="4.11">really something there it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard to</text><text start="3599.62" dur="4.53">convey so you just I just have an idea</text><text start="3601.81" dur="5.91">like how many of you have been in a</text><text start="3604.15" dur="7.11">level to sell driving car like raise</text><text start="3607.72" dur="4.79">your hand if you have been why I would</text><text start="3611.26" dur="3.83">say it&amp;#39;s like temperature</text><text start="3612.51" dur="6.03">10% of you have been like in 11 - well</text><text start="3615.09" dur="7.2">consider that there are 0.2% of cars 11</text><text start="3618.54" dur="5.28">- on the road today so 10% yeah you this</text><text start="3622.29" dur="4.319">audience definitely got a good exposure</text><text start="3623.82" dur="4.41">to them and it&amp;#39;s something that you need</text><text start="3626.609" dur="4.5">to experience you need to realize how</text><text start="3628.23" dur="6.3">better your driving can be and how safe</text><text start="3631.109" dur="5.131">it can be because you are basically</text><text start="3634.53" dur="3.63">relieved by the stress of constantly</text><text start="3636.24" dur="3.119">having to interact with your car making</text><text start="3638.16" dur="4.41">sure that you&amp;#39;re keeping the proper</text><text start="3639.359" dur="4.951">distance with the car ahead of you also</text><text start="3642.57" dur="3.299">a car drives itself as a much shorter</text><text start="3644.31" dur="2.91">reaction time because like you have a</text><text start="3645.869" dur="3">computer like watching the road and</text><text start="3647.22" dur="3.21">taking actions and then at the same time</text><text start="3648.869" dur="3.481">you have a monitoring system it</text><text start="3650.43" dur="5.07">constantly reminds that you have to pay</text><text start="3652.35" dur="5.4">attention and I mean it&amp;#39;s debated there</text><text start="3655.5" dur="4.29">are certain I mean there are voices that</text><text start="3657.75" dur="3.63">say this is actually going to be harder</text><text start="3659.79" dur="3.42">to manage from the driver because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3661.38" dur="4.229">gonna push people to get more distracted</text><text start="3663.21" dur="3.83">I&amp;#39;ve been driving these systems I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="3665.609" dur="3.631">been developing this system and</text><text start="3667.04" dur="4.87">everybody that I talk to that has been</text><text start="3669.24" dur="4.71">like an elaborate systems as a political</text><text start="3671.91" dur="4.199">opinion about how level-2 can actually</text><text start="3673.95" dur="3.9">like improve people&amp;#39;s people striving so</text><text start="3676.109" dur="4.291">I think it&amp;#39;s something like the man will</text><text start="3677.85" dur="4.59">grow as the offer will grow as more and</text><text start="3680.4" dur="3.9">more cars we pushed or three would be</text><text start="3682.44" dur="3.51">will be keeping level two systems I</text><text start="3684.3" dur="5.19">think the acceptance rate is going to</text><text start="3685.95" dur="7.409">grow as a consequence I would say for</text><text start="3689.49" dur="5.76">eleventh for I I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text><text start="3693.359" dur="2.491">literally like a question of costs as I</text><text start="3695.25" dur="3.27">said before</text><text start="3695.85" dur="4.17">11400 really exists and you can you can</text><text start="3698.52" dur="3.03">be driven from point A to point B</text><text start="3700.02" dur="4.44">without having to drive it&amp;#39;s just a</text><text start="3701.55" dur="4.92">matter of can I offer something that is</text><text start="3704.46" dur="4.53">like practical can bring it up from</text><text start="3706.47" dur="6.03">point A to point B we eventually same</text><text start="3708.99" dur="5.79">amount or less time and the same cost or</text><text start="3712.5" dur="5.25">less if that&amp;#39;s true then acceptance rate</text><text start="3714.78" dur="5.31">or like level four it&amp;#39;s gonna be is</text><text start="3717.75" dur="4.98">gonna be mad it&amp;#39;s gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="3720.09" dur="4.41">happen otherwise they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text><text start="3722.73" dur="3.69">succeed and it&amp;#39;s not populace that is</text><text start="3724.5" dur="5.28">gonna be the case definitely I don&amp;#39;t see</text><text start="3726.42" dur="5.43">it being the case for quite a bit so the</text><text start="3729.78" dur="4.079">National Highway Transportation Safety</text><text start="3731.85" dur="3.48">Administration has been a proponent of</text><text start="3733.859" dur="3.51">some of these these driver assist</text><text start="3735.33" dur="5.67">because they save lives like the safer</text><text start="3737.369" dur="5.701">you can make cars I think that helps me</text><text start="3741" dur="2.82">work through acceptance of like letting</text><text start="3743.07" dur="2.46">my</text><text start="3743.82" dur="4.74">Siri yell at me about staying in my lane</text><text start="3745.53" dur="5.67">just as the balance of you know</text><text start="3748.56" dur="4.56">inattention does you know accidents</text><text start="3751.2" dur="3.87">happen when people are not paying</text><text start="3753.12" dur="4.5">attention so I think that&amp;#39;s gonna help</text><text start="3755.07" dur="4.26">be at least a driver for it and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3757.62" dur="4.71">definitely a messaging what he needs to</text><text start="3759.33" dur="4.77">do definitely I did the safety aspect is</text><text start="3762.33" dur="3.24">very important I think there is a huge</text><text start="3764.1" dur="3.45">opportunity for level truth to make a</text><text start="3765.57" dur="5.61">car safer that the starting point is not</text><text start="3767.55" dur="5.55">greater like Fattal accidents are the</text><text start="3771.18" dur="5.79">number one cause of death among young</text><text start="3773.1" dur="5.49">people between age 16 and 24 and they</text><text start="3776.97" dur="4.68">represent about like two percent because</text><text start="3778.59" dur="4.86">of death worldwide so there&amp;#39;s definitely</text><text start="3781.65" dur="5.46">a big opportunity there to make a car</text><text start="3783.45" dur="6.93">safer and smarter regarding 11-4 there</text><text start="3787.11" dur="5.46">is a little bit like nah I see a lot of</text><text start="3790.38" dur="3.9">like unfair comparison when we talk</text><text start="3792.57" dur="4.95">about safety related to level four</text><text start="3794.28" dur="5.61">because what what one of the thing that</text><text start="3797.52" dur="4.41">is being said when when you people like</text><text start="3799.89" dur="4.38">talked about that before is oh well it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3801.93" dur="6.3">gonna be a lot safer but again you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3804.27" dur="5.43">have to compare 11 4 with like you</text><text start="3808.23" dur="3.39">driving the car you have to compare</text><text start="3809.7" dur="4.44">level 4 with the services it&amp;#39;s level Pro</text><text start="3811.62" dur="5.37">compete with which is public</text><text start="3814.14" dur="5.43">transportation which is the driver which</text><text start="3816.99" dur="4.95">if you take aware I would say it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="3819.57" dur="4.23">like another of magnitude safer then you</text><text start="3821.94" dur="3.75">drive your car if anything because is</text><text start="3823.8" dur="3.57">offering your service and is paying more</text><text start="3825.69" dur="4.77">attention that if you weren&amp;#39;t in the car</text><text start="3827.37" dur="4.62">so when you talk about safety for level</text><text start="3830.46" dur="3.18">4 you need to contesta lies it and</text><text start="3831.99" dur="4.41">comparable to a poll which I don&amp;#39;t see</text><text start="3833.64" dur="5.16">it done like very often while in level 2</text><text start="3836.4" dur="8.28">well you need to be better than people</text><text start="3838.8" dur="8.96">to have in the car after is earlier yes</text><text start="3844.68" dur="3.08">great question I think</text><text start="3853.14" dur="5.17">see any potential for complacency on if</text><text start="3856.12" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;re at level two for too long before</text><text start="3858.31" dur="5.4">technology hits level four does the</text><text start="3861.19" dur="4.4">average driver out there that&amp;#39;s tweeting</text><text start="3863.71" dur="4.23">looking at Facebook on their computers</text><text start="3865.59" dur="4.03">become complacent and get distracted you</text><text start="3867.94" dur="3.96">see accident rates going higher than you</text><text start="3869.62" dur="4.41">anticipate it&amp;#39;s currently level two</text><text start="3871.9" dur="3.63">drivers they know they&amp;#39;re in a test law</text><text start="3874.03" dur="4.83">they know they&amp;#39;re supposed to be in</text><text start="3875.53" dur="5.22">acting so they&amp;#39;re participating more if</text><text start="3878.86" dur="5.55">the lag between level two and level four</text><text start="3880.75" dur="5.58">is years do you see that people will</text><text start="3884.41" dur="4.17">trust too much in the increase in</text><text start="3886.33" dur="4.86">accident rates no I think it&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="3888.58" dur="4.14">going the other way around I think like</text><text start="3891.19" dur="3.51">people that get into level two cars</text><text start="3892.72" dur="3.63">today are more confused about this</text><text start="3894.7" dur="3">technology probably are not completely</text><text start="3896.35" dur="4.8">aware of the technology one thing that I</text><text start="3897.7" dur="5.31">I wish Tesla was doing that it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3901.15" dur="4.08">and actually we do is driver monitoring</text><text start="3903.01" dur="3.69">so how do we actually be monitor that</text><text start="3905.23" dur="3.93">the driver is paying attention that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="3906.7" dur="4.56">good way to like educate on this part</text><text start="3909.16" dur="3.87">about what&amp;#39;s the proper behavior to take</text><text start="3911.26" dur="4.62">when you&amp;#39;re on a level 2 car you have to</text><text start="3913.03" dur="4.86">pay attention and yeah I mean if you</text><text start="3915.88" dur="4.53">have like camera watching the driver Jen</text><text start="3917.89" dur="3.84">does that once with supercruise there is</text><text start="3920.41" dur="4.56">like a video camera an infrared camera</text><text start="3921.73" dur="5.01">that looks at you and can tell you if</text><text start="3924.97" dur="3.39">you start and we do the same thing and I</text><text start="3926.74" dur="3.03">think this is very important so as we</text><text start="3928.36" dur="3.51">move forward I think there will be as</text><text start="3929.77" dur="5.01">the acceptance and understanding of what</text><text start="3931.87" dur="4.08">leverage system is I think like drivers</text><text start="3934.78" dur="6.66">and users will be better educated</text><text start="3935.95" dur="7.38">because they understand what so no I</text><text start="3941.44" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t I I expect that over time things</text><text start="3943.33" dur="3.3">are actually gonna get things people are</text><text start="3945.28" dur="3.27">gonna be better educated than they</text><text start="3946.63" dur="2.94">currently are and not to be punitive</text><text start="3948.55" dur="3.51">that I think the other thing that</text><text start="3949.57" dur="4.02">naturally comes from that as the drivers</text><text start="3952.06" dur="2.97">are monitors you know that would be</text><text start="3953.59" dur="4.2">introduced as evidence in a court case</text><text start="3955.03" dur="4.26">at some point so I think knowing that</text><text start="3957.79" dur="3.66">you have a camera on you</text><text start="3959.29" dur="4.65">also will affect you know your</text><text start="3961.45" dur="5.76">interaction with it not just you know</text><text start="3963.94" dur="6.09">fall

dur="5.34">company that has this software update</text><text start="4006.41" dur="6.81">well all cars have that what will Ford</text><text start="4009.65" dur="5.58">be doing over the next 10 years what</text><text start="4013.22" dur="4.74">will their production look like to be</text><text start="4015.23" dur="6.44">able to start adopting this what do you</text><text start="4017.96" dur="7.35">think I can say because I I&amp;#39;m in the</text><text start="4021.67" dur="5.68">industry so and I&amp;#39;ve seen Toyota&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="4025.31" dur="4.8">doing

dur="3.75">their bets it might move this way it</text><text start="4039.53" dur="4.26">might go way more electric you know is</text><text start="4041.57" dur="5.43">the supply chain to support you know a</text><text start="4043.79" dur="5.64">more electric car part in place but they</text><text start="4047" dur="4.38">they have for years although they might</text><text start="4049.43" dur="5.91">not be on the road there they are doing</text><text start="4051.38" dur="5.58">R&amp;amp;D and and I&amp;#39;m not just saying for Ford</text><text start="4055.34" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m saying in general for the car</text><text start="4056.96" dur="3.84">manufacturers we&amp;#39;re seeing them partner</text><text start="4058.46" dur="4.26">there they&amp;#39;ve started forming

dur="5.76">I don&amp;#39;t think they have the full answer</text><text start="4068.12" dur="4.86">yet but at least we were level four for</text><text start="4070.61" dur="5.13">the different levels of development they</text><text start="4072.98" dur="4.56">have been investing money in that so</text><text start="4075.74" dur="2.79">yeah then we let us see it like I I</text><text start="4077.54" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t know what they are waiting for</text><text start="4078.53" dur="5.01">officially because I mean if you think</text><text start="4080.51" dur="4.77">about that like for software Ricola</text><text start="4083.54" dur="3.12">they have like let&amp;#39;s say you have a</text><text start="4085.28" dur="3.48">software glitch and a tap and it have</text><text start="4086.66" dur="3.81">been lagging Toyota&amp;#39;s like several times</text><text start="4088.76" dur="3.69">I compress right so you have the other</text><text start="4090.47" dur="4.59">software Ricola and the software recall</text><text start="4092.45" dur="4.44">you have to recall millions of cars how</text><text start="4095.06" dur="3.779">much of a cost is that like quantifies</text><text start="4096.89" dur="3.98">that it&amp;#39;s like hundreds of millions if</text><text start="4098.839" dur="4.02">you have to recall like millions of cars</text><text start="4100.87" dur="3.52">that&amp;#39;s the equivalent of money that you</text><text start="4102.859" dur="2.971">have to spend for software update and</text><text start="4104.39" dur="3.06">then also like the development cycle</text><text start="4105.83" dur="4.5">your learning cycle is much longer right</text><text start="4107.45" dur="4.65">so you I mean when you&amp;#39;re at least like</text><text start="4110.33" dur="2.389">the fact that you can do so over here</text><text start="4112.1" dur="2.119">update does</text><text start="4112.719" dur="3.721">mean that what you learn is isn&amp;#39;t safe</text><text start="4114.219" dur="4.35">right so you need to work out the safety</text><text start="4116.44" dur="4.079">part of your software before you release</text><text start="4118.569" dur="3.75">it and that part doesn&amp;#39;t change but then</text><text start="4120.519" dur="4.53">I would say there is like an extra</text><text start="4122.319" dur="4.74">probably 70% that is just like user</text><text start="4125.049" dur="4.29">interface things that are not safety</text><text start="4127.059" dur="3.72">critical that if there is a glitch is</text><text start="4129.339" dur="4.05">not the end of the war that you can work</text><text start="4130.779" dur="4.08">out those making updates over the air so</text><text start="4133.389" dur="4.41">how much shorter will the different</text><text start="4134.859" dur="5.791">cycle be if you don&amp;#39;t need like to test</text><text start="4137.799" dur="5.371">for so many hours the fact that if you</text><text start="4140.65" dur="5.04">click a button the the proper answer on</text><text start="4143.17" dur="3.599">UI happens right for example so I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="4145.69" dur="1.409">need to understand what they&amp;#39;re waiting</text><text start="4146.769" dur="3.84">for</text><text start="4147.099" dur="5.91">but the actual answer is I mean like</text><text start="4150.609" dur="4.92">this company is very good at making cars</text><text start="4153.009" dur="3.99">making reliable cars they have a little</text><text start="4155.529" dur="5.61">B to invent themselves if they want to</text><text start="4156.999" dur="5.401">be up to date wait we sort of problem</text><text start="4161.139" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s an infrastructure problem that you</text><text start="4162.4" dur="4.469">have to build and it&amp;#39;s something new so</text><text start="4164.819" dur="3.88">but there you have to do it if they want</text><text start="4166.869" dur="4.23">to be relevant if they want to survive</text><text start="4168.699" dur="3.57">they have to get in today so that why</text><text start="4171.099" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s like there is no way to compete</text><text start="4172.269" dur="3.06">with the other companies that actually</text><text start="4173.469" dur="3.6">are making this a possibility there is</text><text start="4175.329" dur="8.94">like there&amp;#39;s a huge cost opportunity</text><text start="4177.069" dur="9.24">there there&amp;#39;s a lot of value and people</text><text start="4184.269" dur="5.01">doing what they excel at companies too</text><text start="4186.309" dur="4.71">so if you&amp;#39;re awesome at making cars you</text><text start="4189.279" dur="6.181">know partner with people who are awesome</text><text start="4191.019" dur="6.33">at the technology problem Karl yeah just</text><text start="4195.46" dur="3.599">I want to return back to this the</text><text start="4197.349" dur="3.301">concept of safety as you move through</text><text start="4199.059" dur="4.35">the different levels here you talk</text><text start="4200.65" dur="6.029">extensively about that what are some of</text><text start="4203.409" dur="6.511">the the AI approaches that are being</text><text start="4206.679" dur="6.05">developed to address adversarial type of</text><text start="4209.92" dur="6.299">threats to smart vehicles for example I</text><text start="4212.729" dur="5.5">you know you can have like obstruction</text><text start="4216.219" dur="2.791">of signage for example and trick a</text><text start="4218.229" dur="2.64">vehicle</text><text start="4219.01" dur="4.229">thinking that oh that&amp;#39;s not a stop sign</text><text start="4220.869" dur="4.77">so I&amp;#39;m gonna go right by so what are</text><text start="4223.239" dur="5.101">some of the solutions in the AI space</text><text start="4225.639" dur="4.59">that is being explored to make sure that</text><text start="4228.34" dur="4.469">as you move through those levels yeah</text><text start="4230.229" dur="5.341">about time is it that these vehicles are</text><text start="4232.809" dur="6.511">getting smarter and not so susceptible</text><text start="4235.57" dur="6.75">to tricks and adversarial tax definitely</text><text start="4239.32" dur="5.22">so I mean like the problem gets a lot</text><text start="4242.32" dur="4.47">easier the more mice you can</text><text start="4244.54" dur="4.47">collect because you have the choice of</text><text start="4246.79" dur="4.05">deciding which which they thought a</text><text start="4249.01" dur="4.32">favor so for example like as a show</text><text start="4250.84" dur="4.62">during the presentation the large</text><text start="4253.33" dur="4.26">majority of data you collect from from</text><text start="4255.46" dur="3.51">cars so if you don distinguish the one</text><text start="4257.59" dur="2.64">that is good anyone that is did one that</text><text start="4258.97" dur="3.06">is use from the one is not is like</text><text start="4260.23" dur="4.05">boring data it&amp;#39;s like you driving on</text><text start="4262.03" dur="5.04">there is not much to learn after certain</text><text start="4264.28" dur="4.86">point and so yes you need to favor those</text><text start="4267.07" dur="4.35">events that are somewhat events from</text><text start="4269.14" dur="5.01">which you can learn so like having a</text><text start="4271.42" dur="5.19">horror mystery Bhushan of your data that</text><text start="4274.15" dur="4.56">are represented by by specific events</text><text start="4276.61" dur="3.42">from which you can learn and you can do</text><text start="4278.71" dur="3.93">that in many ways like one way that you</text><text start="4280.03" dur="4.5">can do it is like mark every</text><text start="4282.64" dur="3.75">intervention that the try like if you</text><text start="4284.53" dur="3.09">have your system that is like a level</text><text start="4286.39" dur="3.45">two system every time that the user</text><text start="4287.62" dur="3.51">intervenes to correct the car it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4289.84" dur="2.82">somewhat like a disengagement is</text><text start="4291.13" dur="3.06">somewhat like something that they can be</text><text start="4292.66" dur="3.66">didn&amp;#39;t do right and so you can actually</text><text start="4294.19" dur="5.51">collect those event in favor of those</text><text start="4296.32" dur="5.25">events to learn something specific that</text><text start="4299.7" dur="3.73">well so the first one learning is a</text><text start="4301.57" dur="3.42">little bit yes when first learning well</text><text start="4303.43" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s important if a like a personal</text><text start="4304.99" dur="4.68">learning in the sense that you deploy</text><text start="4306.64" dur="6.54">something and you use like the user as</text><text start="4309.67" dur="5.94">so sort of like your feedback there is</text><text start="4313.18" dur="4.2">some sort of like ethical aspect to it</text><text start="4315.61" dur="3.42">that should be you can see that because</text><text start="4317.38" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re using like the user as you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="4319.03" dur="4.77">like reinforcement loop but in a certain</text><text start="4321.52" dur="3.87">sense it&amp;#39;s fair to do it as long as like</text><text start="4323.8" dur="3.33">what you released at any given time is</text><text start="4325.39" dur="3.03">safe no more interesting like you can do</text><text start="4327.13" dur="2.76">it for smell owning like completely like</text><text start="4328.42" dur="3.12">offline so you can you can train your</text><text start="4329.89" dur="3.84">model planner a personal learning so you</text><text start="4331.54" dur="5.46">tap you set up like a simulator like we</text><text start="4333.73" dur="4.65">doing that come and you make the card</text><text start="4337" dur="3.93">learning from from reinforcement</text><text start="4338.38" dur="4.38">learning system so you generate the data</text><text start="4340.93" dur="3.63">so you you generate situation where you</text><text start="4342.76" dur="4.38">put the car in a situation where it</text><text start="4344.56" dur="4.2">shouldn&amp;#39;t be and you learn from that it</text><text start="4347.14" dur="4.23">straight it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not a simple</text><text start="4348.76" dur="3.63">thing but we have like good approaches</text><text start="4351.37" dur="2.64">or calm that we that we are</text><text start="4352.39" dur="3.36">investigating and we actually like using</text><text start="4354.01" dur="4.04">right now on on models that we are</text><text start="4355.75" dur="2.3">deploying</text><text start="4358.41" dur="3">yes</text><text start="4364.929" dur="3.491">so I know you&amp;#39;ve been asked this</text><text start="4366.769" dur="3.45">probably a hundred times before and this</text><text start="4368.42" dur="3.059">question is not new at all but I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="4370.219" dur="3.27">interested on your take on it</text><text start="4371.479" dur="3.81">so the safety issue if you have a car</text><text start="4373.489" dur="4.71">and there are pedestrians and the car</text><text start="4375.289" dur="4.65">has to decide if it&amp;#39;s going to crash to</text><text start="4378.199" dur="4.26">save the pedestrians or the people in</text><text start="4379.939" dur="4.14">the car or maybe a way to crash to save</text><text start="4382.459" dur="3.78">the people in the car and the front</text><text start="4384.079" dur="4.681">versus the back how would a car make</text><text start="4386.239" dur="5.431">that decision great so you&amp;#39;re right I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="4388.76" dur="6.179">been asked a lot of times about this and</text><text start="4391.67" dur="5.579">the answer is IIIi don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="4394.939" dur="5.58">very very relevant problem at the moment</text><text start="4397.249" dur="5.551">like it&amp;#39;s not at the point where like</text><text start="4400.519" dur="3.901">this kind of decision matters and also I</text><text start="4402.8" dur="3.089">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s very relevant even if</text><text start="4404.42" dur="3.09">we were at that point I think the answer</text><text start="4405.889" dur="5.46">is very relevant at the point that you</text><text start="4407.51" dur="6.12">may need like a car that is like driving</text><text start="4411.349" dur="5.161">safer than a human like the sort of</text><text start="4413.63" dur="5.339">decisions are really down the point</text><text start="4416.51" dur="4.169">where they don&amp;#39;t matter I don&amp;#39;t see such</text><text start="4418.969" dur="3.75">like I don&amp;#39;t see it even from an ethical</text><text start="4420.679" dur="4.17">point of view I don&amp;#39;t see it being like</text><text start="4422.719" dur="3.661">that like let the engineer on the side</text><text start="4424.849" dur="4.951">like as long as the overall output</text><text start="4426.38" dur="5.009">system is like safer it does not really</text><text start="4429.8" dur="3.48">matter like what what would a human do</text><text start="4431.389" dur="3.36">right the only reason why we don&amp;#39;t ask</text><text start="4433.28" dur="3.659">this question to human is because we</text><text start="4434.749" dur="3.99">think that it&amp;#39;s happening fasting after</text><text start="4436.939" dur="3.3">the human doesn&amp;#39;t have to think about it</text><text start="4438.739" dur="2.641">but so what would a human do let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="4440.239" dur="2.7">you have enough time to think about it</text><text start="4441.38" dur="3.359">in some case you might have enough time</text><text start="4442.939" dur="5.16">to think about this situation what would</text><text start="4444.739" dur="5.311">a human do and I would say another</text><text start="4448.099" dur="3.661">possible answer is well how to prevent</text><text start="4450.05" dur="3.21">this sort of situation beforehand so you</text><text start="4451.76" dur="3.149">want we want to be able to minimize as</text><text start="4453.26" dur="2.989">much as possible situation where you</text><text start="4454.909" dur="4.08">have no good options</text><text start="4456.249" dur="4.361">so that would be step one and then step</text><text start="4458.989" dur="3.45">two is like I mean like what do you mean</text><text start="4460.61" dur="3.779">I think it&amp;#39;s not a girl question that</text><text start="4462.439" dur="3.631">applies to robust I think it&amp;#39;s a legal</text><text start="4464.389" dur="3.511">question that like could could apply to</text><text start="4466.07" dur="5.1">you man if you want ask the question I</text><text start="4467.9" dur="4.799">think I know during startup we drive a I</text><text start="4471.17" dur="3.989">did a presentation and that question</text><text start="4472.699" dur="4.471">came up there and for their models they</text><text start="4475.159" dur="3.81">trained to stop so like even if it</text><text start="4477.17" dur="5.639">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be an immediate safety</text><text start="4478.969" dur="6.15">thing and this is it was in limited</text><text start="4482.809" dur="4.89">deployment but it was to take the car</text><text start="4485.119" dur="6.29">safely to a stop before they got to</text><text start="4487.699" dur="3.71">where it was collision closed</text><text start="4508.179" dur="6.46">yes well our complaints is already it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4510.8" dur="6.149">already happened it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not full</text><text start="4514.639" dur="3.75">automation but like I would say like</text><text start="4516.949" dur="4.861">planes are the closest thing to what we</text><text start="4518.389" dur="6.241">intend as level to level to driver like</text><text start="4521.81" dur="4.019">Suzanne driving cars in agriculture</text><text start="4524.63" dur="3.69">already happened why do you have these</text><text start="4525.829" dur="6.241">like big tractors doing doing the

it and there are</text><text start="4538.88" dur="8.699">probably like good warning systems to</text><text start="4541.159" dur="8.161">avoid colliding with icebergs and other</text><text start="4547.579" dur="4.321">fields like train I&amp;#39;m trained already</text><text start="4549.32" dur="4.41">like people automated like me to meet</text><text start="4551.9" dur="4.86">metals there are like me it was like um</text><text start="4553.73" dur="5.15">it was don&amp;#39;t even and like I Drive like</text><text start="4556.76" dur="8.129">a Macanese like a person that

start="4581.9" dur="3.69">probably gonna be like the tail of of</text><text start="4583.849" dur="3.75">these things which is why when we talk</text><text start="4585.59" dur="3.72">about like level 5 this idea of having</text><text start="4587.599" dur="3.991">like a curve it has complete itself</text><text start="4589.31" dur="4.95">without the assistance of a human as</text><text start="4591.59"

it&amp;#39;s gonna be I think at the</text><text start="4599" dur="5.67">tail of many how they are filled that</text><text start="4601.849" dur="4.201">are gonna be automated first so we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="4604.67" dur="4.17">gonna know when we&amp;#39;re gonna be close to</text><text start="4606.05" dur="4.589">level 5 we will know it if we now we</text><text start="4608.84" dur="4.049">don&amp;#39;t know it means that we&amp;#39;re not close</text><text start="4610.639" dur="4.471">I think one good thing that comes out of</text><text start="4612.889" dur="4.71">it though is a lot of the technology</text><text start="4615.11" dur="3.46">used to detect things and solve problems</text><text start="4617.599" dur="3.161">in</text><text start="4618.57" dur="3.9">to end up cars can be used for assisted</text><text start="4620.76" dur="3.57">technology on other modes of</text><text start="4622.47" dur="4.2">transportation so they&amp;#39;ve already

in</text><text start="4635.07" dur="2.57">your space</text><text start="4645.78" dur="5.18">so obviously you as a company and all</text><text start="4649.05" dur="4.41">companies will have tremendous</text><text start="4650.96" dur="4.84">tremendous incentive to make it an</text><text start="4653.46" dur="4.83">accident free environment because one</text><text start="4655.8" dur="5.69">accident is going to drive your share</text><text start="4658.29" dur="6.92">price down so that will necessarily</text><text start="4661.49" dur="6.85">limit what your car will allow

start="4691.5" dur="6.9">individual passenger or owner autonomy</text><text start="4695.12" dur="5.92">can you express your opinion on that</text><text start="4698.4" dur="6.72">yeah I mean I think like people</text><text start="4701.04" dur="6.33">shouldn&amp;#39;t speed and I mean say I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="4705.12" dur="3.48">see why cars like and we are able to go</text><text start="4707.37" dur="3.18">up to 100 miles per hour</text><text start="4708.6" dur="3.66">like if the max limit is like 70 like</text><text start="4710.55" dur="3.3">let&amp;#39;s say 7 let&amp;#39;s say 80 miles per hour</text><text start="4712.26" dur="2.97">I can limit the speed of 80 miles per</text><text start="4713.85" dur="2.94">hour like the large majority of</text><text start="4715.23" dur="2.67">accidents are caused because people are</text><text start="4716.79" dur="4.59">driving in a way they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text><text start="4717.9" dur="5.19">drive so limiting the the way that the</text><text start="4721.38" dur="3.6">car is capable of what the carriage</text><text start="4723.09" dur="5.43">capable of doing is not a limit to</text><text start="4724.98" dur="4.95">freedom of like owner of the car to</text><text start="4728.52" dur="4.59">drive the car it&amp;#39;s actually like a smart</text><text start="4729.93" dur="4.35">thing to do but I want also like comment</text><text start="4733.11" dur="3.72">on the first thing that you said which</text><text start="4734.28" dur="4.05">is like one accident the for autonomous</text><text start="4736.83" dur="2.91">vehicle is gonna be very bad and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4738.33" dur="3.96">gonna there is a need to push for</text><text start="4739.74" dur="5.76">accident phrase well I mean perfect is</text><text start="4742.29" dur="4.74">the worst enemy of good right so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4745.5" dur="3.26">focus where we are now and let&amp;#39;s try to</text><text start="4747.03" dur="3.439">make things better let&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="4748.76" dur="3.9">overemphasize of</text><text start="4750.469" dur="3.841">yes there&amp;#39;s gonna be accidents but we</text><text start="4752.66" dur="2.91">have a lot of accidents now we need to</text><text start="4754.31" dur="3.87">make something that is better than now</text><text start="4755.57" dur="4.89">if we if we if we emphasize too much</text><text start="4758.18" dur="3.66">like for example we do with planes when</text><text start="4760.46" dur="3.72">there is a like a plane accident we</text><text start="4761.84" dur="4.68">emphasize it too much then people are</text><text start="4764.18" dur="6.78">gonna have this like over a perception</text><text start="4766.52" dur="7.11">for what safety is and yeah we need to</text><text start="4770.96" dur="4.44">avoid we to do our best to avoid to get</text><text start="4773.63" dur="3.569">into these like force perception that</text><text start="4775.4" dur="3.45">some driving her are not gonna be safe</text><text start="4777.199" dur="4.201">because we are worth a lot about one</text><text start="4778.85" dur="4.53">accident we have to wait it with actual</text><text start="4781.4" dur="5.28">data actual numbers we have to wait it</text><text start="4783.38" dur="6.48">with the 37,000 fatalities that happen</text><text start="4786.68" dur="4.08">each year in US and so yeah I think I</text><text start="4789.86" dur="2.82">think we need to have a database</text><text start="4790.76" dur="3.54">approach when when we talk about safety</text><text start="4792.68" dur="9.93">and it&amp;#39;s very important that we push for</text><text start="4794.3" dur="10.56">that yes so you&amp;#39;re talking about an</text><text start="4802.61" dur="5.94">autonomous vehicle is there any</text><text start="4804.86" dur="4.859">development that a vehicle is part of a</text><text start="4808.55" dur="4.919">network and they will exchange</text><text start="4809.719" dur="5.611">information like intent what a car like</text><text start="4813.469" dur="3.691">intent what a car is going to do it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4815.33" dur="3.96">going to turn alright and then other</text><text start="4817.16" dur="4.47">cars no so you&amp;#39;re talking like vehicle</text><text start="4819.29" dur="4.32">to vehicle communication exactly I have</text><text start="4821.63" dur="5.49">two traffic lights or whatever yes okay</text><text start="4823.61" dur="5.55">so I I think it&amp;#39;s different things I</text><text start="4827.12" dur="3.63">think one of them is good one of them is</text><text start="4829.16" dur="2.82">now going to happen so what is now going</text><text start="4830.75" dur="3.09">to happen I think is very good a</text><text start="4831.98" dur="3.719">communication the problem with a connect</text><text start="4833.84" dur="4.02">to communication are public I would say</text><text start="4835.699" dur="4.77">to one problem is it&amp;#39;s gonna be very</text><text start="4837.86" dur="4.41">hard to make every car manufacturer to</text><text start="4840.469" dur="4.471">agree on a protocol of communication I</text><text start="4842.27" dur="4.14">just don&amp;#39;t see this happening like so</text><text start="4844.94" dur="3.36">which type of the ATAG an exchange</text><text start="4846.41" dur="4.35">because like you basically need to may</text><text start="4848.3" dur="6.149">have many developers agreeing on a</text><text start="4850.76" dur="5.91">common standard and also I don&amp;#39;t see it</text><text start="4854.449" dur="3.511">being necessary like you understand what</text><text start="4856.67" dur="3.24">the other car is doing by observing</text><text start="4857.96" dur="3.3">other car you don&amp;#39;t need to know in</text><text start="4859.91" dur="3.24">advance of what the other guy is going</text><text start="4861.26" dur="4.05">to do and also like how do you trust</text><text start="4863.15" dur="3.51">like you are not the developer like if</text><text start="4865.31" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;re talking about they convey</text><text start="4866.66" dur="2.88">communication between your cars probably</text><text start="4868.43" dur="2.7">you can do something but you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="4869.54" dur="3.99">going to have a fee that is large enough</text><text start="4871.13" dur="5.64">to be relevant and to be something you</text><text start="4873.53" dur="5.81">can rely on so if you have to rely on</text><text start="4876.77" dur="4.599">somebody else development of like</text><text start="4879.34" dur="5">attributes like in</text><text start="4881.369" dur="5.52">path accelerations those things that are</text><text start="4884.34" dur="3.54">not even simple to measure and to</text><text start="4886.889" dur="3.121">predict in the future</text><text start="4887.88" dur="3.18">well imagine trusting not something to</text><text start="4890.01" dur="3.3">battle but trusting somebody that</text><text start="4891.06" dur="3.809">somebody has developed so I don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="4893.31" dur="3.51">even if it was the case I don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="4894.869" dur="4.951">this being being useful like I don&amp;#39;t see</text><text start="4896.82" dur="4.5">I don&amp;#39;t see one thing that instead I do</text><text start="4899.82" dur="3.12">see happening is vehicle to</text><text start="4901.32" dur="3.87">infrastructure communication between v2</text><text start="4902.94" dur="3.84">ax so v2 action genera like this idea</text><text start="4905.19" dur="3.33">that like the car needs some information</text><text start="4906.78" dur="3.75">from the first structure so for example</text><text start="4908.52" dur="4.17">like traffic light you want to optimize</text><text start="4910.53" dur="3.99">for traffic you want to optimize for</text><text start="4912.69" dur="5.94">like going from A to B you want to know</text><text start="4914.52" dur="5.82">the state of for example of traffic</text><text start="4918.63" dur="3.75">lights and so yeah you can know that but</text><text start="4920.34" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s different because there is like a</text><text start="4922.38" dur="4.65">manufacturer or that makes the standard</text><text start="4924.81" dur="3.869">and then it&amp;#39;s up to the car developers</text><text start="4927.03" dur="3.45">again to a standard that they didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="4928.679" dur="4.29">have to admit to the Indonesia start to</text><text start="4930.48" dur="5.489">comply with so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a little</text><text start="4932.969" dur="4.111">bit easier to push under standard and</text><text start="4935.969" dur="3.721">also I see it being useful</text><text start="4937.08" dur="7.139">I see like yeah I mean knowing in</text><text start="4939.69" dur="5.759">advance informations that&amp;#39;s useful and I</text><text start="4944.219" dur="2.761">mean a certain size it&amp;#39;s already</text><text start="4945.449" dur="3.841">happening like v2 acts like if you want</text><text start="4946.98" dur="4.44">to know like I mean like your GPS</text><text start="4949.29" dur="2.67">position like in some senses be two acts</text><text start="4951.42" dur="2.009">right</text><text start="4951.96" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re you are you are communicating</text><text start="4953.429" dur="8.661">with with satellite so it&amp;#39;s just an</text><text start="4956.31" dur="11.94">evolution of what&amp;#39;s already here yes</text><text start="4962.09" dur="8.56">so standards for inter communication</text><text start="4968.25" dur="4.02">already exist in the development world</text><text start="4970.65" dur="4.199">why do you think it would be different</text><text start="4972.27" dur="5.04">for autonomous vehicles like well why do</text><text start="4974.849" dur="3.841">you think developers were in create come</text><text start="4977.31" dur="5.159">together and create a set of standards</text><text start="4978.69" dur="6.77">that they can develop on well because I</text><text start="4982.469" dur="6.451">mean fundamentally there is really no so</text><text start="4985.46" dur="7.09">I mean the death like a reason I mean I</text><text start="4988.92" dur="5.279">saying yes you can be standard part of a</text><text start="4992.55" dur="3.54">communication but if there is no I</text><text start="4994.199" dur="4.111">really need for that like a real</text><text start="4996.09" dur="3.779">advantage there&amp;#39;s another reason for</text><text start="4998.31" dur="3.36">that not to happen so it&amp;#39;s two of the</text><text start="4999.869" dur="4.62">course not only one so again on</text><text start="5001.67" dur="4.41">something is not the course not being</text><text start="5004.489" dur="2.821">useful he&amp;#39;s another obstacles if you put</text><text start="5006.08" dur="3.36">these two things together that&amp;#39;s why I</text><text start="5007.31" dur="3.179">see is not going to happen for for</text><text start="5009.44" dur="2.829">because I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s impossible</text><text start="5010.489" dur="3.911">to agree on</text><text start="5012.269" dur="3.66">as I&amp;#39;m saying that if there is not to be</text><text start="5014.4" dur="3.65">like a big push for it it&amp;#39;s not going to</text><text start="5015.929" dur="2.121">happen</text><text start="5018.739" dur="4.63">yeah I think if you like you people I</text><text start="5022.05" dur="2.609">mean the companies should invest not</text><text start="5023.369" dur="3.031">like understanding environment</text><text start="5024.659" dur="4.83">understanding what other cars are doing</text><text start="5026.4" dur="4.5">but it what are their like players on</text><text start="5029.489" dur="3.36">the environment are doing based on what</text><text start="5030.9" dur="4.38">you observe from them rather than having</text><text start="5032.849" dur="4.89">them telling you what&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="5035.28" dur="4.62">happen my work okay for cars but what</text><text start="5037.739" dur="4.771">about cyclists what about pedestrians</text><text start="5039.9" dur="5.52">and those are like equivalently are the</text><text start="5042.51" dur="4.29">players on this on on the film like on</text><text start="5045.42" dur="5.159">the environment that you have to deal</text><text start="5046.8" dur="5.549">with and so yeah even if you if you</text><text start="5050.579" dur="5.19">could help it&amp;#39;s not something you can</text><text start="5052.349" dur="6.42">rely entirely because not this</text><text start="5055.769" dur="11.011">information cannot even come from all</text><text start="5058.769" dur="10.381">the players in the environment security</text><text start="5066.78" dur="6.629">measures you guys have been taking not</text><text start="5069.15" dur="6.27">to hack your software yeah so I mean</text><text start="5073.409" dur="5.13">like okay so you know when you develop</text><text start="5075.42" dur="4.409">systems for for like level two is</text><text start="5078.539" dur="3.12">different than when you al when you</text><text start="5079.829" dur="3.571">develop like safety systems from level</text><text start="5081.659" dur="4.801">two in abhava when we develop system for</text><text start="5083.4" dur="5.88">like level two the driver is always</text><text start="5086.46" dur="5.039">responsible in the end and so you need</text><text start="5089.28" dur="5.37">to make sure that every action that the</text><text start="5091.499" dur="7.2">car takes in autonomy is never gonna be</text><text start="5094.65" dur="5.58">too abrupt to make the driver are not</text><text start="5098.699" dur="2.94">capable of really taking control of the</text><text start="5100.23" dur="4.559">vehicle if they if the car is something</text><text start="5101.639" dur="6.75">wrong so by doing this you&amp;#39;re limiting</text><text start="5104.789" dur="5.191">for example the amount of like the</text><text start="5108.389" dur="6.21">operational domain of your actuators</text><text start="5109.98" dur="5.82">some example like the braking system you</text><text start="5114.599" dur="3.991">need to make sure that your braking</text><text start="5115.8" dur="4.83">system is never gonna command too much</text><text start="5118.59" dur="4.049">braking deceleration because if you are</text><text start="5120.63" dur="3.389">mistakenly braking when you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5122.639" dur="3.181">think you are driving a highway at high</text><text start="5124.019" dur="3.511">speed then you can cause an accident so</text><text start="5125.82" dur="3.719">the way that you make the system saves</text><text start="5127.53" dur="4.02">for level two is you limit your</text><text start="5129.539" dur="4.98">operational domain what that translates</text><text start="5131.55" dur="5.189">into is you are making a system that by</text><text start="5134.519" dur="4.04">design is now going to be able to handle</text><text start="5136.739" dur="5.63">100 percent of the mice that you drive</text><text start="5138.559" dur="7.14">to give you like some numbers like</text><text start="5142.369" dur="6">people that drive with the tez autopilot</text><text start="5145.699" dur="6.36">from Statistics some people from the</text><text start="5148.369" dur="5.13">University of MIT collected a large data</text><text start="5152.059" dur="4.35">form from a fleet that they monitored</text><text start="5153.499" dur="4.85">and thirdly I think it&amp;#39;s 32 percent of</text><text start="5156.409" dur="5.34">the miles driven are driven with</text><text start="5158.349" dur="7.33">autopilot on for us for people to drive</text><text start="5161.749" dur="7.83">with open pilot it&amp;#39;s 52 percent we are</text><text start="5165.679" dur="6.331">working towards the 80 percent maybe 85</text><text start="5169.579" dur="4.02">we know we are not like by design of a</text><text start="5172.01" dur="3.12">level system is now gonna get to other</text><text start="5173.599" dur="3.781">percent there are certain environment</text><text start="5175.13" dur="4.049">where if you have the cooperating in</text><text start="5177.38" dur="3.21">autonomy there
