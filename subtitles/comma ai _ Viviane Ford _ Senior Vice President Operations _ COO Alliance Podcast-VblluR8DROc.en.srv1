dur="3.48">third-party software then are you</text><text start="152.269" dur="3.181">starting to license this software did</text><text start="153.95" dur="3.36">any of the car companies are you just</text><text start="155.45" dur="4.83">selling this as the connector market</text><text start="157.31" dur="5.7">addition to vehicles so so the software</text><text start="160.28" dur="5.31">yes the software is under MIT license so</text><text start="163.01" dur="5.4">we open-source this on github if someone</text><text start="165.59" dur="5.19">wanted to go and build a system that ran</text><text start="168.41" dur="5.43">the software and then sell that system</text><text start="170.78" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;d be completely entitled to we are</text><text start="173.84" dur="4.86">we basically just sell to whoever wants</text><text start="176.54" dur="5.64">to buy it if Ford wanted to buy you know</text><text start="178.7" dur="4.679">a hundred common ions you know that the</text><text start="182.18" dur="3.059">hardware and install it in their</text><text start="183.379" dur="3.901">vehicles they could go ahead and do that</text><text start="185.239" dur="4.771">you know we don&amp;#39;t have a business</text><text start="187.28" dur="4.86">development department we have we have a</text><text start="190.01" dur="3.63">website with an order now

dur="4.44">in the first Google experimental car at</text><text start="200.42" dur="4.02">Ted I was at the main TED Conference</text><text start="202.91" dur="3.12">sitting in the audience and someone from</text><text start="204.44" dur="3.329">Google came out and talked about this</text><text start="206.03" dur="3.539">vehicle and then they showed a video and</text><text start="207.769" dur="3.601">you know I&amp;#39;m sitting beside Jeff Bezos</text><text start="209.569" dur="3.51">Bill Gates is in the audience and</text><text start="211.37" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re talking about this car that none</text><text start="213.079" dur="3.571">of us had seen I don&amp;#39;t think very many</text><text start="214.91" dur="3.99">had even heard about it 10 years ago and</text><text start="216.65" dur="3.72">then the the person who&amp;#39;s doing the</text><text start="218.9" dur="3.36">demonstration said by the way if you</text><text start="220.37" dur="4.38">want to drive in it it&amp;#39;s out this door</text><text start="222.26" dur="5.43">on the parking lot and 1800 people stood</text><text start="224.75" dur="4.59">up and went running and I got to drive</text><text start="227.69" dur="3.84">it and I have a video on my laptop of me</text><text start="229.34" dur="3.57">driving in this Prius 10 years ago with</text><text start="231.53" dur="3.06">Mort Matt Groening the founder of The</text><text start="232.91" dur="4.35">Simpsons was beside me in the vehicle</text><text start="234.59" dur="5.19">and we drove on a test track 10 years</text><text start="237.26" dur="4.46">ago at 45 miles an hour and I was just</text><text start="239.78" dur="3.329">going holy like this thing is</text><text start="241.72" dur="4.12">extraordinary</text><text start="243.109" dur="6.551">yeah and I&amp;#39;ve since owned to Teslas I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="245.84" dur="6.76">been driving them now for years how</text><text start="249.66" dur="4.53">how complex I got so so MIT labs</text><text start="252.6" dur="3.36">developed the software and then you guys</text><text start="254.19" dur="4.769">are third-party licensing it or did you</text><text start="255.96" dur="5.31">develop my choice yeah we developed the</text><text start="258.959" dur="5.341">software it&amp;#39;s under MIT license but we</text><text start="261.27" dur="7.65">did develop a software and so yeah</text><text start="264.3" dur="6.06">basically we you know we maintain the</text><text start="268.92" dur="4.14">software the beauty of having open</text><text start="270.36" dur="4.8">source software is that one you get a</text><text start="273.06" dur="4.44">community that can contribute to it so</text><text start="275.16" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s so many you know there&amp;#39;s so many</text><text start="277.5" dur="3.93">makes and models out there that are a</text><text start="279.36" dur="4.44">little different and how they run</text><text start="281.43" dur="4.44">and so when you community member that</text><text start="283.8" dur="4.53">wants this to be supported for their car</text><text start="285.87" dur="4.8">and if they go through the effort to you</text><text start="288.33" dur="4.71">know send a pull request to have their</text><text start="290.67" dur="3.93">car supported and merged with you know</text><text start="293.04" dur="2.97">the next version of open pilot like</text><text start="294.6" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s fantastic you&amp;#39;re building</text><text start="296.01" dur="5.06">community of people that are you know</text><text start="298.14" dur="5.58">actively working to basically like it to</text><text start="301.07" dur="6.94">you know to push forward the technology</text><text start="303.72" dur="7.68">and also a beautiful thing about the</text><text start="308.01" dur="6.48">open-source code is that code is you</text><text start="311.4" dur="5.04">know anyone can if anyone&amp;#39;s concerned</text><text start="314.49" dur="3.87">with the code they can go and read</text><text start="316.44" dur="4.05">through it they can you know if there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="318.36" dur="4.77">safety concerns or whatever to some</text><text start="320.49" dur="5.28">extent code is speech so they can go</text><text start="323.13" dur="6.06">ahead and have their you know have a</text><text start="325.77" dur="4.62">look at everything we do and decide for</text><text start="329.19" dur="2.55">themselves if this is something they</text><text start="330.39" dur="4.89">want to put in their car instead of</text><text start="331.74" dur="5.67">getting into you know like a I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="335.28" dur="4.53">know a Honda Civic with the lane keep</text><text start="337.41" dur="4.92">assist system and having really little</text><text start="339.81" dur="4.44">idea of how it works and just kind of</text><text start="342.33" dur="5.16">you know trust and get and engaging it</text><text start="344.25" dur="6.84">and seeing it for yourself you know how</text><text start="347.49" dur="5.91">it works on the road and so why am I</text><text start="351.09" dur="4.2">scared of this why is this got me work</text><text start="353.4" dur="3.54">with the open-source idea that somebody</text><text start="355.29" dur="3.18">can just download this and put it into</text><text start="356.94" dur="3.45">their car why is that scaring the hell</text><text start="358.47" dur="4.11">out of me when I went again I&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="360.39" dur="3.78">you know I drove my Tesla Model 3 from</text><text start="362.58" dur="3.81">Scottsdale to Vancouver and let it drive</text><text start="364.17" dur="3.81">2000 or the 2200 miles on its own but</text><text start="366.39" dur="1.98">this scares me for some reason what am I</text><text start="367.98" dur="2.64">missing</text><text start="368.37" dur="5.52">I think there&amp;#39;s a couple of reasons that</text><text start="370.62" dur="6.6">these is scary and the first one is that</text><text start="373.89" dur="5.94">any time there&amp;#39;s a autonomous vehicle</text><text start="377.22" dur="4.65">accident like it is so publicized it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="379.83" dur="2.75">publicized until people can just you</text><text start="381.87" dur="3.71">know get</text><text start="382.58" dur="7.26">single blast click on their story</text><text start="385.58" dur="5.88">possible so we have so so many ideas in</text><text start="389.84" dur="4.02">our head that like these systems aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="391.46" dur="4.47">safe or you know oh but did you see that</text><text start="393.86" dur="4.47">you know this auto pilot accident caused</text><text start="395.93" dur="3.93">this issue whereas it&amp;#39;s like sure along</text><text start="398.33" dur="4.92">with that article what if we also</text><text start="399.86" dur="6.119">publicize how many people die just by</text><text start="403.25" dur="4.59">driving a regular car that sertoli yeah</text><text start="405.979" dur="4.62">I think there&amp;#39;s that level that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="407.84" dur="7.41">little alarming the open source code I</text><text start="410.599" dur="6.181">think also scares people because I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="415.25" dur="4.139">want to say that any of like the worst</text><text start="416.78" dur="6.359">like responsibility is the hardware to</text><text start="419.389" dur="6">place in this situation but Minh dove</text><text start="423.139" dur="5.161">like hey take a look at our code if you</text><text start="425.389" dur="4.891">like our code then maybe you&amp;#39;ll you know</text><text start="428.3" dur="5.19">want to explore and experiment with it</text><text start="430.28" dur="5.609">and and and see how it runs with your</text><text start="433.49" dur="6.72">Honda Civic and so there&amp;#39;s like an</text><text start="435.889" dur="7.14">active active like exploration phase</text><text start="440.21" dur="4.41">that the driver is is using because</text><text start="443.029" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re downloading this code from the</text><text start="444.62" dur="4.38">internet and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying it</text><text start="446.509" dur="5.851">in their vehicle as opposed to kind of a</text><text start="449" dur="5.669">black box delivery of you know Tesla</text><text start="452.36" dur="3.899">autopilot here you are take a drive but</text><text start="454.669" dur="2.911">we&amp;#39;re like where are they testing this</text><text start="456.259" dur="2.34">oh they&amp;#39;re downloading the software and</text><text start="457.58" dur="1.98">they&amp;#39;re just throwing it in their car</text><text start="458.599" dur="7.021">and they&amp;#39;re going for a drive around</text><text start="459.56" dur="8.43">Scottsdale sure yeah I mean we have we</text><text start="465.62" dur="4.769">have millions of miles of driving data</text><text start="467.99" dur="3.84">from this we have hundreds of YouTube</text><text start="470.389" dur="4.68">videos of people driving around with the</text><text start="471.83" dur="5.459">system so well where are they testing it</text><text start="475.069" dur="5.13">like they&amp;#39;re you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s better</text><text start="477.289" dur="5.461">testing almost than any other</text><text start="480.199" dur="3.81">self-driving car companies product</text><text start="482.75" dur="3.779">because they don&amp;#39;t even have a product</text><text start="484.009" dur="4.921">really you know like there&amp;#39;s only so</text><text start="486.529" dur="4.411">many I mean part of the big issue too is</text><text start="488.93" dur="4.53">like there&amp;#39;s so many edge cases with</text><text start="490.94" dur="5.159">drivings that it&amp;#39;s impossible to to hand</text><text start="493.46" dur="4.949">code all of the edge cases of driving</text><text start="496.099" dur="3.63">George I think it like Elon Musk had a</text><text start="498.409" dur="4.141">line when we first came out with the</text><text start="499.729" dur="4.321">system and he was like you know sure 99%</text><text start="502.55" dur="5.459">of this is easy it&amp;#39;s the one percent</text><text start="504.05" dur="6.599">that&amp;#39;s really hard right but when you</text><text start="508.009" dur="4.83">try to capture all of the edge cases</text><text start="510.649" dur="3.601">like way mo with like I don&amp;#39;t know what</text><text start="512.839" dur="3.08">their fleet is let&amp;#39;s say their fleets</text><text start="514.25" dur="3.95">like a hundred cars or whatever</text><text start="515.919" dur="4.081">but that&amp;#39;s still just that&amp;#39;s not gonna</text><text start="518.2" dur="3.779">get you all of the edge cases and so</text><text start="520" dur="5.73">when you&amp;#39;re just relying and depending</text><text start="521.979" dur="5.871">on you know all of the the all of the</text><text start="525.73" dur="5.099">data from your own cars as opposed to</text><text start="527.85" dur="5.59">kind of like decentralizing the data</text><text start="530.829" dur="5.19">consumption and getting data from people</text><text start="533.44" dur="4.98">all over the world you know all of a</text><text start="536.019" dur="7.56">sudden you have a much more like fully</text><text start="538.42" dur="8.37">packaged kind of you know data</text><text start="543.579" dur="4.891">exploration to go whether were there a</text><text start="546.79" dur="3.979">lot of legal hurdles in getting launched</text><text start="548.47" dur="6.09">or getting the product out the door</text><text start="550.769" dur="5.291">certainly so yeah I mean we we got a</text><text start="554.56" dur="4.13">letter from the National Highway</text><text start="556.06" dur="9.6">Transportation Safety Authority back in</text><text start="558.69" dur="8.86">2016 and so I yes so so we we actually I</text><text start="565.66" dur="4.679">think I think the open source in 2016</text><text start="567.55" dur="4.92">who knows the years are all the same but</text><text start="570.339" dur="3.631">regardless they they were concerned we</text><text start="572.47" dur="4.47">had announced at TechCrunch that we were</text><text start="573.97" dur="5.489">selling this product with open pilot on</text><text start="576.94" dur="4.11">the product and that this product was</text><text start="579.459" dur="3.601">going to drive your car I mean it was a</text><text start="581.05" dur="3.51">lot of hype the product can&amp;#39;t drive you</text><text start="583.06" dur="4.139">know nothing can drive your car you</text><text start="584.56" dur="5.399">still can&amp;#39;t sit in a self-driving car</text><text start="587.199" dur="6.091">everything driver assistance system</text><text start="589.959" dur="6.181">still level two and so there was</text><text start="593.29" dur="4.859">definitely you know I think similar when</text><text start="596.14" dur="4.41">you ask why am I scared of this there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="598.149" dur="5.821">just a lack of information around a lot</text><text start="600.55" dur="5.399">of this stuff and so a big thing with</text><text start="603.97" dur="4.679">open sourcing it&amp;#39;s like how do we show</text><text start="605.949" dur="4.441">the information how do we you know how</text><text start="608.649" dur="3.63">do we just like yeah explain like what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="610.39" dur="3.66">going on and and and publish more of the</text><text start="612.279" dur="2.971">information publish more of the data we</text><text start="614.05" dur="3.21">definitely tried to do this with like</text><text start="615.25" dur="3.959">more medium posts we&amp;#39;ve tried to publish</text><text start="617.26" dur="3.509">more you know like this is how we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="619.209" dur="5.181">using the data this is how we&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="620.769" dur="6.541">we&amp;#39;re being compliant with NHTSA&amp;#39;s</text><text start="624.39" dur="6.4">requests they basically sent a list of</text><text start="627.31" dur="4.44">17 questions I think was about 17 and</text><text start="630.79" dur="2.4">they were totally reasonable they were</text><text start="631.75" dur="2.97">totally reasonable questions asking us</text><text start="633.19" dur="3.41">you know like what what is this product</text><text start="634.72" dur="7.74">what is it doing how can you guarantee</text><text start="636.6" dur="9.4">certain aspects about the product and</text><text start="642.46" dur="6.45">but apart from that I think the I think</text><text start="646" dur="5.49">like the trend of the general</text><text start="648.91" dur="4.77">self-driving space is moving more</text><text start="651.49" dur="4.98">towards like not even away from</text><text start="653.68" dur="4.41">regulation but like when you have you</text><text start="656.47" dur="3.63">know lame-o come out and announce that</text><text start="658.09" dur="4.17">they like hyped it up a little too much</text><text start="660.1" dur="4.68">for the first X years that they&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="662.26" dur="4.32">you know working on self-driving cars or</text><text start="664.78" dur="3.48">you have all these companies that are</text><text start="666.58" dur="4.26">slowly realizing like this problem is</text><text start="668.26" dur="5.4">actually really difficult like not that</text><text start="670.84" dur="6.93">regulation catches up but it just the</text><text start="673.66" dur="6.03">the problem slows down that the pace you</text><text start="677.77" dur="3.72">think it&amp;#39;ll be solved slows down and</text><text start="679.69" dur="3.39">that reassures people automatically yeah</text><text start="681.49" dur="2.76">I think it&amp;#39;s also the people are getting</text><text start="683.08" dur="2.79">more and more comfortable with it now</text><text start="684.25" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re just we&amp;#39;re not hearing about the</text><text start="685.87" dur="3.21">accidents constantly we have heard the</text><text start="687.7" dur="2.52">arguments now that there&amp;#39;s other cars</text><text start="689.08" dur="2.52">that are crashing we&amp;#39;re not hearing</text><text start="690.22" dur="2.52">about those so I think we&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="691.6" dur="3.12">getting more and more comfortable with</text><text start="692.74" dur="3.93">the idea and then we&amp;#39;re also you know</text><text start="694.72" dur="4.05">four years ago it was just weird or five</text><text start="696.67" dur="4.14">years ago was weird hearing a Tesla</text><text start="698.77" dur="4.26">creep up behind you and now it&amp;#39;s like oh</text><text start="700.81" dur="3.87">you you almost can hear them now which</text><text start="703.03" dur="3.03">is so bizarre right we could never hear</text><text start="704.68" dur="4.02">them before and now we can hear them</text><text start="706.06" dur="6.21">which is really strange so how did you</text><text start="708.7" dur="6.24">get involved in the company so the</text><text start="712.27" dur="4.92">founder I lived in this house called the</text><text start="714.94" dur="4.95">crypto castle in San Francisco very San</text><text start="717.19" dur="4.44">Francisco it was basically a three-story</text><text start="719.89" dur="4.23">townhouse in downtown San Francisco with</text><text start="721.63" dur="6.06">a bunch of people who were interested in</text><text start="724.12" dur="5.91">Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and George</text><text start="727.69" dur="4.53">the founder moved into the basement of</text><text start="730.03" dur="3.84">this house he was basically looking to</text><text start="732.22" dur="3.3">start his own self-driving car start up</text><text start="733.87" dur="6.84">and needed a basement where he could</text><text start="735.52" dur="9.57">pack away a car and so I&amp;#39;m and became</text><text start="740.71" dur="6.81">friends he I like just lived and saw him</text><text start="745.09" dur="7.71">develop this company for the first like</text><text start="747.52" dur="8.48">seven or eight months and then in about</text><text start="752.8" dur="5.73">a year later three and a half years ago</text><text start="756" dur="5.62">he was looking for an Operations person</text><text start="758.53" dur="6.03">and I went up to him and I said he</text><text start="761.62" dur="3.57">should hire me and definitely took some</text><text start="764.56" dur="4.95">convincing</text><text start="765.19" dur="6.54">um and yeah about two weeks later I</text><text start="769.51" dur="4.11">think I was offered the job and I took</text><text start="771.73" dur="3.96">it with very little operations</text><text start="773.62" dur="3.6">experience that&amp;#39;s really cool okay so</text><text start="775.69" dur="3.93">you guys got involved he saw it in the</text><text start="777.22" dur="4.47">earliest sort of early stages and then</text><text start="779.62" dur="8.34">you went to and you did you launched it</text><text start="781.69" dur="10.68">disrupt in New York yeah yeah so I mean</text><text start="787.96" dur="7.5">yes that was 2016 13 early stages we we</text><text start="792.37" dur="6.12">had done a Bloomberg article in 2015</text><text start="795.46" dur="4.86">which launched I think that it was like</text><text start="798.49" dur="3.87">really the first of first unofficial</text><text start="800.32" dur="4.17">official launch of just comma as a</text><text start="802.36" dur="4.53">company and people were intrigued to see</text><text start="804.49" dur="5.1">what he was up to what he was doing and</text><text start="806.89" dur="5.25">then in at TechCrunch we announced this</text><text start="809.59" dur="4.53">whole you know shebang of a product kind</text><text start="812.14" dur="4.23">of trying to fall into the hype of</text><text start="814.12" dur="4.41">self-driving cars before you quickly</text><text start="816.37" dur="6.54">realized that all of that is dangerous</text><text start="818.53" dur="6.69">to fall into and then we open sourced so</text><text start="822.91" dur="5.64">yeah correct myself we open sourced the</text><text start="825.22" dur="4.77">software in 2016 we had no hardware we</text><text start="828.55" dur="3.24">had and we had hardware be an</text><text start="829.99" dur="4.11">open-source the hardware required to run</text><text start="831.79" dur="8.04">on the software but we weren&amp;#39;t selling</text><text start="834.1" dur="7.32">it and then we had a community of people</text><text start="839.83" dur="3.99">just like building out this harder and</text><text start="841.42" dur="4.86">and and working on the product and then</text><text start="843.82" dur="4.83">we if we launched the comedy on the</text><text start="846.28" dur="4.65">hardware that supports open pilot if if</text><text start="848.65" dur="4.92">people want it also we launched it was a</text><text start="850.93" dur="5.07">dash cam so you know for people that</text><text start="853.57" dur="4.79">came development kit launched that in</text><text start="856" dur="6.72">2017 and kind of have consistently been</text><text start="858.36" dur="6.94">you know updating with with new versions</text><text start="862.72" dur="7.8">of both Eon and open pilot how are you</text><text start="865.3" dur="8.46">funded so through a 16 ca-16 zeal we</text><text start="870.52" dur="8.13">were still serious seed a 16 z led our</text><text start="873.76" dur="6.75">to our two rounds yeah we did two series</text><text start="878.65" dur="4.869">seeds how much have you raised so far</text><text start="880.51" dur="7.059">the 8.1 mountain</text><text start="883.519" dur="6.24">that&amp;#39;s pretty substantial for a seed yes</text><text start="887.569" dur="4.62">it was to seed so the first seed was 3.1</text><text start="889.759" dur="4.89">million the second seed was 5 million we</text><text start="892.189" dur="5.07">have we have revenue um we have revenue</text><text start="894.649" dur="7.581">and we keep our power we keep operations</text><text start="897.259" dur="9.3">very very lean we&amp;#39;re team of 13 12 or 13</text><text start="902.23" dur="6.82">you know it&amp;#39;s yeah if the real goal has</text><text start="906.559" dur="5.31">been how do we become profitable which</text><text start="909.05" dur="5.579">is not a question that startups asked</text><text start="911.869" dur="4.861">themselves but I think it was you know</text><text start="914.629" dur="3.841">kind of a it was important to be like if</text><text start="916.73" dur="3.959">this is gonna be sustainable how can we</text><text start="918.47" dur="4.109">make money along the way as opposed to</text><text start="920.689" dur="4.051">just blowing through millions and</text><text start="922.579" dur="3.841">millions of dollars to technology that</text><text start="924.74" dur="4.079">you can&amp;#39;t even ship you know yeah yeah I</text><text start="926.42" dur="4.829">led I I was brought in as a coach for</text><text start="928.819" dur="3.93">the team at HootSuite about four or five</text><text start="931.249" dur="3.63">years ago and I led their strategic</text><text start="932.749" dur="3.991">planning retreat and I pushed them to</text><text start="934.879" dur="4.56">consider profitability as a way to scale</text><text start="936.74" dur="4.319">instead of more equity in debt financing</text><text start="939.439" dur="3.09">and they decided to go for it and I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="941.059" dur="3.301">like I don&amp;#39;t understand why people don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="942.529" dur="4.441">like it&amp;#39;s so simple to actually build a</text><text start="944.36" dur="4.11">real company if you decide to and you</text><text start="946.97" dur="4.559">have what any more control so that is</text><text start="948.47" dur="5.099">that is that is your focus then yeah and</text><text start="951.529" dur="4.68">what you said was build a real company</text><text start="953.569" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s exactly what we do and we yeah</text><text start="956.209" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s way more control it&amp;#39;s also</text><text start="957.529" dur="3.961">just the easiest we didn&amp;#39;t know that</text><text start="959.959" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re actually adding value to the</text><text start="961.49" dur="4.289">world is you know are you - yeah if</text><text start="964.459" dur="2.701">people are buying it you&amp;#39;re making money</text><text start="965.779" dur="2.61">off of it and it keeps you lean and</text><text start="967.16" dur="3.69">keeps you smart and scrappy it&amp;#39;s so</text><text start="968.389" dur="4.44">amazing when we think when whatsapp sold</text><text start="970.85" dur="4.56">for like 1.4 billion they only had 50</text><text start="972.829" dur="4.8">employees yeah you know so you&amp;#39;re on the</text><text start="975.41" dur="4.049">same trajectory so I love that that he</text><text start="977.629" dur="3.661">was working with getting some</text><text start="979.459" dur="3.84">early-stage free PR Ezra well I wrote a</text><text start="981.29" dur="3.599">book about a year ago called free PR and</text><text

dur="3.33">that what&amp;#39;s been that would have been</text><text start="1073.429" dur="3.451">the I guess what are the hassles would</text><text start="1075.41" dur="2.759">have been the pitfalls and they the</text><text start="1076.88" dur="2.13">struggles with the whole open source</text><text start="1078.169" dur="7.14">side of the business</text><text start="1079.01" dur="8.78">I mean honestly there are not many I</text><text start="1085.309" dur="2.481">mean</text><text start="1087.98" dur="6.09">the beauty of being an open-source</text><text start="1090.83" dur="4.26">business is that it forces you to like</text><text start="1094.07" dur="2.7">you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not going to just</text><text start="1095.09" dur="3.6">open-source your software and then be</text><text start="1096.77" dur="4.41">very secretive about everything else you</text><text start="1098.69" dur="5.16">do you&amp;#39;re gonna be an open company it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1101.18" dur="6.72">gonna approach what you do with an open</text><text start="1103.85" dur="8.25">mindset and so kind of a default mindset</text><text start="1107.9" dur="6.24">of kamma is like publicise what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1112.1" dur="5.55">happening be honest about what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1114.14" dur="6.03">happening you know like yeah there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1117.65" dur="4.29">nothing we don&amp;#39;t want to have things to</text><text start="1120.17" dur="3.06">hide because if you have secrecy you</text><text start="1121.94" dur="4.26">probably don&amp;#39;t have anything at all is</text><text start="1123.23" dur="6.51">the idea and so I think that that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1126.2" dur="5.04">definitely a just like a positive a very</text><text start="1129.74" dur="4.38">positive reinforcement of what</text><text start="1131.24" dur="5.07">open-source does for me like from a</text><text start="1134.12" dur="4.44">personal perspective I had come</text><text start="1136.31" dur="5.07">I joined comma from like a tech PR firm</text><text start="1138.56" dur="5.13">that was

of</text><text start="1146.09" dur="4.68">comma where all of these people are deep</text><text start="1149.18" dur="5.55">you know deeply admire the open-source</text><text start="1150.77"

use this or get</text><text start="1159.8" dur="3.78">a leg up on whatever they&amp;#39;re doing but</text><text start="1162.35" dur="3.66">then you really said that&amp;#39;s exactly the</text><text start="1163.58" dur="5.76">point where like if you do open-source</text><text start="1166.01" dur="4.95">this and you do give even you know even</text><text start="1169.34" dur="3.99">like people who aren&amp;#39;t necessarily</text><text start="1170.96" dur="3.84">direct competitors but if this</text><text start="1173.33" dur="3.36">information is out there in the world</text><text start="1174.8" dur="4.41">then everyone already has a plus-one to</text><text start="1176.69" dur="5.91">having this information we just like</text><text start="1179.21" dur="4.71">help you know and also like if if a</text><text start="1182.6" dur="2.82">competitor comes along and builds a</text><text start="1183.92" dur="3.03">better hardware system that&amp;#39;s gonna run</text><text start="1185.42"

that your system</text><text start="1191.03" dur="4.71">is always promising you know the the</text><text start="1193.34" dur="4.05">better experience for users so</text><text start="1195.74" dur="3.39">definitely for me initially it was kind</text><text start="1197.39" dur="4.14">of like a jolt of a different way of</text><text start="1199.13" dur="3.48">thinking that&amp;#39;s cool so you said you</text><text start="1201.53" dur="2.94">came in and you didn&amp;#39;t have any</text><text start="1202.61" dur="3.09">operations experience so how did you how</text><text start="1204.47" dur="9.03">have you learned it</text><text start="1205.7" dur="9.71">I mean on the job yeah yeah I think the</text><text start="1213.5" dur="3.24">the thing I quickly realized was that</text><text start="1215.41" dur="3.28">operations</text><text start="1216.74" dur="3.9">you don&amp;#39;t want glory in operations you</text><text start="1218.69" dur="3.81">want to be like as behind-the-scenes as</text><text start="1220.64" dur="4.02">possible because it means the company&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1222.5" dur="3.9">being run and people aren&amp;#39;t realizing</text><text start="1224.66" dur="3.95">that something&amp;#39;s an issue if that you</text><text start="1226.4" dur="6.21">know you don&amp;#39;t want there to be issues</text><text start="1228.61" dur="5.92">which was a very interesting just just a</text><text start="1232.61" dur="4.14">different approach of like okay how do I</text><text start="1234.53" dur="4.62">you know how do I go about this how do i</text><text start="1236.75" dur="6">how do I make sure that the things that</text><text start="1239.15" dur="5.85">are happening are happening in a way</text><text start="1242.75" dur="6.18">that that people don&amp;#39;t like people can</text><text start="1245" dur="5.19">do their job and thankfully like comma</text><text start="1248.93" dur="3.59">grew with me</text><text start="1250.19" dur="5.04">you know comma when I joined comma was I</text><text start="1252.52" dur="4.57">think we had ten or eleven people</text><text start="1255.23" dur="3.48">because we had interns and those interns</text><text start="1257.09" dur="4.11">left so we were like down to six at one</text><text start="1258.71" dur="4.05">point so six person company if you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1261.2" dur="3.3">never done operations before you can</text><text start="1262.76" dur="4.53">learn and you can like manage quickly</text><text start="1264.5" dur="5.13">and because common has scaled that like</text><text start="1267.29" dur="5.13">a very I think like appropriate rate</text><text start="1269.63" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s been a good a good way of like</text><text start="1272.42" dur="6.03">learning and yeah I mean when you&amp;#39;re in</text><text start="1276.77" dur="3.69">San Francisco every other person does</text><text start="1278.45" dur="6.15">operations to some extent right</text><text start="1280.46" dur="5.19">Moses yeah how about attracting talent I</text><text start="1284.6" dur="3.15">mean the Bay Area&amp;#39;s got to be one of the</text><text start="1285.65" dur="4.14">most competitive areas for tech talent</text><text start="1287.75" dur="3.63">for sure and for even for the Ontario</text><text start="1289.79" dur="4.56">students so how are you attracting</text><text start="1291.38" dur="4.23">talent yeah so this was very interesting</text><text start="1294.35" dur="3.69">and and one of the reasons we actually</text><text start="1295.61" dur="3.39">moved to San Diego oh right yeah you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1298.04" dur="4.59">in San Diego now too</text><text start="1299" dur="7.16">you&amp;#39;ve done San Diego yeah I think</text><text start="1302.63" dur="5.94">initially I mean working at comma is</text><text start="1306.16" dur="4.75">different than working at almost any</text><text start="1308.57" dur="3.69">other company so already with just like</text><text start="1310.91" dur="2.67">the open source factor you&amp;#39;re gonna</text><text start="1312.26" dur="2.67">attract people that are interested in</text><text start="1313.58" dur="4.38">the open source community and that was</text><text start="1314.93" dur="5.16">key so like number one way for us to</text><text start="1317.96" dur="4.26">attract count talent was like through</text><text start="1320.09" dur="3.51">get up pouring over people&amp;#39;s kid hopes</text><text start="1322.22" dur="2.82">making sure that you know like people</text><text start="1323.6" dur="3.42">were already contributing to the open</text><text start="1325.04" dur="3.84">source community people who are excited</text><text start="1327.02" dur="5.16">about those projects are gonna be really</text><text start="1328.88" dur="5.58">excited about you know open sourced your</text><text start="1332.18" dur="6.72">consistent system so that was kind of a</text><text start="1334.46" dur="4.92">helpful way also I think that so yeah it</text><text start="1338.9" dur="2.28">is real</text><text start="1339.38" dur="3.81">hard to you know when Google&amp;#39;s gonna pay</text><text start="1341.18" dur="3.39">a machine learning engineer hundreds of</text><text start="1343.19" dur="3.09">thousands of dollars and you&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="1344.57" dur="4.71">to keep your startup very lean and</text><text start="1346.28" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re not gonna offer that what you get</text><text start="1349.28" dur="2.7">on the flip side though is people that</text><text start="1350.63" dur="2.64">are in it because they really do believe</text><text start="1351.98" dur="4.83">that this company is going to succeed</text><text start="1353.27" dur="6.39">which is always the goal and so you know</text><text start="1356.81" dur="5.73">you people who come in and take you know</text><text start="1359.66" dur="4.41">you give a sliding scale of equity and</text><text start="1362.54" dur="3.6">salary and people who take like you know</text><text start="1364.07" dur="4.08">is the slowest salary and the highest</text><text start="1366.14" dur="3.96">equity because always like a positive</text><text start="1368.15" dur="3.63">you know reinforcement of where this</text><text start="1370.1" dur="3.84">person thinks the company is going</text><text start="1371.78" dur="4.62">moving to San Diego</text><text start="1373.94" dur="3.9">so it was hard it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s obviously super</text><text start="1376.4" dur="5.31">hard to recruit it&amp;#39;s obviously very hard</text><text start="1377.84" dur="5.91">to attract talent and going to San Diego</text><text start="1381.71" dur="3.48">one of the ideas was like okay maybe</text><text start="1383.75" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;ll be able to attract talent more</text><text start="1385.19" dur="5.34">easily qual comes here you know maybe</text><text start="1387.26" dur="4.62">will be different than the thousands of</text><text start="1390.53" dur="4.4">startups in the Bay Area that are all</text><text start="1391.88" dur="9.33">trying to attract the same people that</text><text start="1394.93" dur="8.62">played out so I Monica Lee we a lot of</text><text start="1401.21" dur="4.88">our employees not a lot but a decent</text><text start="1403.55" dur="5.64">amount now have come from our community</text><text start="1406.09" dur="5.68">and so that&amp;#39;s proven to be like more and</text><text start="1409.19" dur="4.53">more the best way to get people is</text><text start="1411.77" dur="3.3">people that are that find themselves in</text><text start="1413.72" dur="3.12">the common community are already</text><text start="1415.07" dur="4.38">interested and then if they you know</text><text start="1416.84" dur="4.5">contributed really positively floating</text><text start="1419.45" dur="6.36">the idea of joining a company it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="1421.34" dur="6.81">an exciting next step so and also just</text><text start="1425.81" dur="4.05">kind of realizing that San Diego is also</text><text start="1428.15" dur="4.83">a more pleasant place to live I think</text><text start="1429.86" dur="5.25">then the Bay Area barry smith says he</text><text start="1432.98" dur="4.32">was amazing yes you news great it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1435.11" dur="3.84">easier to attract people from you know</text><text start="1437.3" dur="3.63">wherever in the u.s. to move to San</text><text start="1438.95" dur="3.06">Diego than to move to San Francisco well</text><text start="1440.93" dur="3.36">in San Diego&amp;#39;s got a pretty good</text><text start="1442.01"

also that that</text><text start="1448.85" dur="3.75">helps because then we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="1450.62" dur="4.38">biotech so we&amp;#39;re different yeah I&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="1452.6" dur="3.45">a bunch of my for I&amp;#39;ve coached a lot of</text><text start="1455" dur="2.16">companies and I&amp;#39;ve got a number of</text><text start="1456.05" dur="2.31">different coaching clients that are in</text><text start="1457.16" dur="4.2">San Diego and then a couple of our</text><text start="1458.36" dur="4.59">members of our CEO or Alliance are in</text><text start="1461.36" dur="4.92">San Diego as well it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a great</text><text start="1462.95" dur="4.65">great market so what are you guys</text><text start="1466.28" dur="3.53">struggling with right now what are the</text><text start="1467.6" dur="2.21">pain points</text><text start="1472.35" dur="5.31">I think the main pain point is like what</text><text start="1475.59" dur="4.44">what do you want your company to look</text><text start="1477.66" dur="5.76">like you know we built this company and</text><text start="1480.03" dur="5.28">you were you you&amp;#39;re working towards</text><text start="1483.42" dur="4.08">profitability so this is the old this is</text><text start="1485.31" dur="5.19">for now the ultimate goal you know like</text><text start="1487.5" dur="5.64">in the immediate future but what kind of</text><text start="1490.5" dur="4.97">a company do you scale into what kind of</text><text start="1493.14" dur="5.13">company do you become how do you</text><text start="1495.47" dur="4.75">decentralize the responsibilities of the</text><text start="1498.27" dur="3.9">company so you don&amp;#39;t have like one</text><text start="1500.22" dur="5.49">single point of failure being your CEO</text><text start="1502.17" dur="6.45">or whatever how do you you know how do</text><text start="1505.71" dur="4.44">you work on I guess at the core of it</text><text start="1508.62" dur="4.05">like it&amp;#39;s our product in the company we</text><text start="1510.15" dur="4.05">talk about a lot stability so stability</text><text start="1512.67" dur="4.83">on the product and stability in the</text><text start="1514.2" dur="4.83">company and how do you build something</text><text start="1517.5" dur="4.77">that will outlast everyone that is</text><text start="1519.03" dur="5.9">currently at this company you know those</text><text start="1522.27" dur="4.68">kind of thoughts that you have when you</text><text start="1524.93" dur="3.52">yeah if you&amp;#39;re profitable you can</text><text start="1526.95" dur="4.08">self-sustained for hopefully a very very</text><text start="1528.45" dur="3.05">long time and then what does that look</text><text start="1531.03" dur="3.21">like</text><text start="1531.5" dur="3.94">how are you kind of giving the vision to</text><text start="1534.24" dur="3.21">your team right now how are you</text><text start="1535.44" dur="3.8">articulating it or getting them aligned</text><text start="1537.45" dur="4.83">and inspired and then how do you also</text><text start="1539.24" dur="5.04">keep a group of people super excited</text><text start="1542.28" dur="4.89">when they&amp;#39;re coming on for equity and</text><text start="1544.28" dur="5.05">the company&amp;#39;s seemingly moving towards a</text><text start="1547.17" dur="5.43">profitability focus does that distract</text><text start="1549.33" dur="4.89">them at all I mean in and by all rights</text><text start="1552.6" dur="4.05">they should be focused on profitability</text><text start="1554.22" dur="5.94">anyway but if it&amp;#39;s builder busts that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1556.65" dur="6.54">a different goal so how do you keep</text><text start="1560.16" dur="6.15">people incentive is an interesting less</text><text start="1563.19" dur="6.18">incentive eyes and more a more aligned</text><text start="1566.31" dur="6.39">more aligned and inspired you know it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1569.37" dur="6.81">the vision yeah they&amp;#39;re not just trying</text><text start="1572.7" dur="6.27">to focus on an exit I think what helps</text><text start="1576.18" dur="5.88">is having an actual user base so we have</text><text start="1578.97" dur="4.8">like a community discord and a lot of</text><text start="1582.06" dur="2.97">our users are on that discord and a lot</text><text start="1583.77" dur="4.08">of our employees are on that discord</text><text start="1585.03" dur="5.01">talking fusers you know like having beta</text><text start="1587.85" dur="4.35">programs and stuff like that that house</text><text start="1590.04" dur="4.5">because you literally see what you are</text><text start="1592.2" dur="6">doing affecting people that you were</text><text start="1594.54" dur="6.63">talking being a 13-person company what</text><text start="1598.2" dur="5.13">you work on has a big impact you know</text><text start="1601.17" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re not working on like a product</text><text start="1603.33" dur="3.81">project with IP</text><text start="1605.04" dur="4.44">bounine have that be scrapped like if</text><text start="1607.14" dur="5.1">you don&amp;#39;t do something it&amp;#39;s obvious and</text><text start="1609.48" dur="5.67">it hurts you know it hurts the company</text><text start="1612.24" dur="5.52">so I think that alignment like will come</text><text start="1615.15" dur="5.46">naturally just people seeing you know</text><text start="1617.76" dur="5.96">what their work has and then in terms of</text><text start="1620.61" dur="6.3">like the profitability equity think I</text><text start="1623.72" dur="5.56">don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s directly related</text><text start="1626.91" dur="3.93">to comma when people hear that I think</text><text start="1629.28" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s more of a realization of like the</text><text start="1630.84" dur="5.16">state of feces in the state of San</text><text start="1634.17" dur="3.9">Francisco Silicon Valley or like that</text><text start="1636" dur="3.75">money will dry up the money that they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1638.07" dur="3.66">just handing out to companies will dry</text><text start="1639.75" dur="3.48">up so if you do want to succeed if you</text><text start="1641.73" dur="4.44">do want to win at self-driving cars and</text><text start="1643.23" dur="5.19">solve self-driving cars what better way</text><text start="1646.17" dur="5.85">than to create a profitable company that</text><text start="1648.42" dur="6.09">doesn&amp;#39;t die on these investors and I</text><text start="1652.02" dur="5.22">think that mindset just helps in general</text><text start="1654.51" dur="5.85">you know people get on board with with</text><text start="1657.24" dur="4.32">yeah putting profit first can you and I</text><text start="1660.36" dur="2.82">know that you&amp;#39;re still privately held</text><text

numbers at all or did</text><text start="1667.32" dur="8.55">you to keep that stuff private still so</text><text start="1671.46" dur="9.12">we had I think was around 160 grand in</text><text start="1675.87" dur="10.77">revenue um and you know we spend at a</text><text start="1680.58" dur="9.6">rate of about you know about probably</text><text start="1686.64" dur="6.66">180 grand a month is our burn rate so</text><text start="1690.18" dur="7.26">you know close to close to getting those</text><text start="1693.3" dur="8.37">two numbers very aligned which is yeah</text><text start="1697.44" dur="5.73">which would be great and ideally we</text><text start="1701.67" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t need to raise money again you know</text><text start="1703.17" dur="5.31">ideally we
