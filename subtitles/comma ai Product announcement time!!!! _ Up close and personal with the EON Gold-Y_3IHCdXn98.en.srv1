dur="7.409">key idea is to find it you know not</text><text start="100.049" dur="5.591">after it already took place but like</text><text start="103.299" dur="6.42">after the horses that were born that</text><text start="105.64" dur="6.78">meant some ladies trying to play with a</text><text start="109.719" dur="6">lot and we give like it&amp;#39;s like an early</text><text start="112.42"

no</text><text start="127.229" dur="5.29">you know one solution that is assault</text><text start="130.03" dur="4.62">everything it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text><text

don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="146.019" dur="4.261">think there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="148.24" dur="3.78">Tesla they haven&amp;#39;t publicized whether</text><text start="150.28" dur="4.11">they have it they have liked it some</text><text start="152.02" dur="3.9">elements of a people components but I</text><text start="154.39" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s many others</text><text start="155.92" dur="4.71">that have implemented that inside their</text><text start="157.84" dur="4.92">cars it will be a part of the overall</text><text start="160.63" dur="3.96">solution over time but we see the place</text><text start="162.76" dur="5.04">that most aliens are starting is</text><text start="164.59" dur="6.03">disliked about base where you can</text><text start="167.8" dur="7.62">actually have a level of detection which</text><text start="170.62" dur="7.62">is what it&amp;#39;s actually prescribed work</text><text start="175.42" dur="4.74">for the automakers you can happen today</text><text start="178.24" dur="4.98">if you have a basement data that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="180.16" dur="5.61">already collecting and this is the only</text><text start="183.22" dur="5.34">way to actually offer protection across</text><text start="185.77" dur="4.32">the fleet and not only individual</text><text start="188.56" dur="3.6">vehicles would we see both of these</text><text start="190.09" dur="5.01">solutions working together and</text><text start="192.16" dur="5.67">ultimately be consumed by when you see</text><text start="195.1" dur="4.41">here in the sock which i think is you</text><text start="197.83" dur="3.63">know the acceleration of the stocks</text><text start="199.51" dur="3.03">being built product but it was we dived</text><text start="201.46" dur="4.65">across the world</text><text start="202.54" dur="5.05">I think us may be ahead of the curve by</text><text start="206.11" dur="5.55">affecting</text><text start="207.59" dur="6.99">like a huge other thing for them yes</text><text start="211.66" dur="6.13">again preciate all of your information</text><text start="214.58" dur="5.07">is there&amp;#39;s a lot to go through here we</text><text start="217.79" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time but let&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="219.65" dur="6.66">talk real quick so couple things your</text><text start="222.5" dur="6.66">company finds things happening in dis</text><text start="226.31" dur="5.64">numbers misbehavior</text><text start="229.16" dur="4.37">solution for everyone out there how what</text><text start="231.95" dur="5.34">is the role of it I mean is it a</text><text start="233.53" dur="6.28">subscriber only it&amp;#39;s everyone</text><text start="237.29" dur="4.71">so we sell to two types of constituents</text><text start="239.81" dur="5.61">one is OEMs we some of them directly and</text><text start="242" dur="6.03">we sell to OEM a OMB does not benefit</text><text start="245.42" dur="4.83">and if they&amp;#39;re not our custom because</text><text start="248.03" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s away of the data and we will</text><text start="250.25" dur="4.41">predict their vehicles based and the</text><text start="253.13" dur="4.579">other constituent that we have is</text><text start="254.66" dur="5.82">complete it&amp;#39;s not only isolates like</text><text start="257.709" dur="6.041">enterprises that have connected people</text><text start="260.48" dur="6.45">police trucks or our companies that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="263.75" dur="5.22">very similar but a slightly different</text><text start="266.93" dur="3.989">organization but it&amp;#39;s basically they</text><text start="268.97" dur="4.949">they share the same problem because if</text><text start="270.919" dur="4.981">you know I was during lunch I was</text><text start="273.919" dur="6.171">telling this example imagine something</text><text start="275.9" dur="8.79">like the FedEx late day before Christmas</text><text start="280.09" dur="7.78">somebody accidentally nope no driver can</text><text start="284.69" dur="4.86">turn on the FedEx what I was thinking</text><text start="287.87" dur="4.29">this all the presses were coming to me</text><text start="289.55" dur="3.58">there but what are they herded - OH -</text><text start="292.16" dur="3.04">whoa</text><text start="293.13" dur="3.03">yeah but what about you know again this</text><text start="295.2" dur="3.69">whole conversation we&amp;#39;ve been having</text><text start="296.16" dur="5.37">about you know how important it is and</text><text start="298.89" dur="5.13">again I understand collaborates from the</text><text start="301.53" dur="3.99">CRC and everyone said this is but a</text><text start="304.02" dur="4.35">certain extent as we&amp;#39;re talking about</text><text start="305.52" dur="6.32">our learnings on the autonomous cars on</text><text start="308.37" dur="6.51">parts of that works and don&amp;#39;t work or</text><text start="311.84" dur="4.87">processes or algorithms on the other end</text><text start="314.88" dur="3.48">on the cybersecurity you know that all</text><text start="316.71" dur="6.3">of a sudden you realize oh my gosh this</text><text start="318.36" dur="7.02">product or or double or om you&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="323.01" dur="4.59">after or they&amp;#39;re going after the breaks</text><text start="325.38" dur="4.17">north of the steering you know that type</text><text start="327.6" dur="3.72">of thing is that become a shared economy</text><text start="329.55" dur="3.63">to work where does that what&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="331.32" dur="4.86">balance between you being an independent</text><text start="333.18" dur="6.39">company and you know that&amp;#39;s you helping</text><text start="336.18" dur="4.83">out so we share with the community in</text><text start="339.57" dur="3.9">the community shares with us and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="341.01" dur="6.74">been you know I think just last week we</text><text start="343.47" dur="8.28">were at Auto eyes that which is a data</text><text start="347.75" dur="6.76">sharing environment or both</text><text start="351.75" dur="6.45">for vendors to share share finding</text><text start="354.51" dur="6.81">spirit we&amp;#39;re part of that having said</text><text start="358.2" dur="5.55">that I think with anybody even you know</text><text start="361.32" dur="4.74">we can find things it&amp;#39;s not to say that</text><text start="363.75" dur="4.47">you look let&amp;#39;s say we&amp;#39;re serving okay if</text><text start="366.06" dur="4.8">he does not have capabilities to do</text><text start="368.22" dur="4.2">something with things that we found we</text><text start="370.86" dur="4.68">can share it and they might know about</text><text start="372.42" dur="6.26">know and they might not be able to do</text><text start="375.54" dur="8.79">anything about it and if you have I mean</text><text start="378.68" dur="8.37">we&amp;#39;re not number of poems or tabs or in</text><text start="384.33" dur="2.72">the danger zone</text><text start="389.24" dur="6.55">we&amp;#39;ve published privately nada nada the</text><text start="392.64" dur="8.25">public I can tell you that you know be</text><text start="395.79" dur="7.56">from this base the I wouldn&amp;#39;t say like</text><text start="400.89" dur="5.61">the best like the nation&amp;#39;s some some of</text><text start="403.35" dur="6.36">the components not the best title</text><text start="406.5" dur="6.72">security practices have used and was</text><text start="409.71" dur="4.86">rated so things that we know in the IT</text><text start="413.22" dur="4.38">side do not so true</text><text start="414.57" dur="4.59">and here&amp;#39;s you still see it like so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="417.6" dur="3.33">so happy we know it didn&amp;#39;t happen for</text><text start="419.16" dur="3.66">well people I&amp;#39;m talking about how the</text><text start="420.93" dur="4.799">the components were created so things</text><text start="422.82" dur="8.01">like no encryption on the data transfer</text><text start="425.729" dur="7.921">using UDP binary like kind of like basic</text><text start="430.83" dur="4.41">stuff are still there because you</text><text start="433.65" dur="3.21">haven&amp;#39;t you have trucks that have you</text><text

after you still</text><text start="443.88" dur="5.18">seeing people be lazy or not being this</text><text start="446.37" dur="4.92">exciting I think there&amp;#39;s way more on</text><text start="449.06" dur="4.66">understanding today things are</text><text start="451.29" dur="6.18">definitely improving but you still have</text><text start="453.72" dur="5.76">coding cars and that is very old but</text><text start="457.47" dur="3.63">final question on the test that you</text><text start="459.48" dur="3.45">brought them up and of course one of the</text><text start="461.1" dur="4.59">things with someone unique and then a</text><text start="462.93" dur="5.43">single box architecture</text><text start="465.69" dur="3.63">it says the way the future is that</text><text

is kind of like the</text><text start="482.43" dur="5.07">way that they tried to attack himself</text><text start="484.25" dur="7.35">bigger than anybody else&amp;#39;s in the space</text><text

of the aliens back then so they are</text><text start="497.34" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s one of their approaches they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="499.53" dur="4.11">using you know another thing that was</text><text start="501.24" dur="5.28">announces like how they use bounties</text><text start="503.64" dur="5.51">which is like you pay actors or quite</text><text start="506.52" dur="5.97">has to
