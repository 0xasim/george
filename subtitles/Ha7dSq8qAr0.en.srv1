of</text><text start="4.759" dur="3.27">read like so driving level one features</text><text start="6.74" dur="2.639">and so they can&amp;#39;t be the other will use</text><text start="8.029" dur="5.19">their art and for for having a better</text><text start="9.379" dur="5.491">perception however we want we strongly</text><text start="13.219" dur="7.381">believe in vision and we are moving away</text><text start="14.87" dur="7.89">from using data at all the distance</text><text start="20.6" dur="4.29">horizon for the radar how far out can</text><text start="22.76" dur="4.32">the radar see right now well so that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="24.89" dur="4.65">limitation that can be a specifically to</text><text start="27.08" dur="3.66">calculate the cap one of the twenty</text><text start="29.54" dur="3.36">meters it&amp;#39;s kind of like the meaning</text><text start="30.74" dur="3.75">with if gain saves at 120 when I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="32.9" dur="5.28">talking meter so it&amp;#39;s like when I like</text><text start="34.49" dur="7.14">35 yards it&amp;#39;s like the video that those</text><text start="38.18" dur="7.44">rather I can see but I mean like usually</text><text start="41.63" dur="6.15">they go up to 150 160 180 but then like</text><text start="45.62" dur="4.44">what use the purpose like sings so far</text><text start="47.78" dur="4.32">right it becomes like even if you see a</text><text start="50.06" dur="3.9">car when it&amp;#39;s like 180 meters away</text><text start="52.1" dur="3.42">becomes very hard to understand you see</text><text start="53.96" dur="3.93">the cavities clips I&amp;#39;m like in my lane</text><text start="55.52" dur="4.559">or it&amp;#39;s not like when it wins like so</text><text start="57.89" dur="4.77">far we know T if there is like a kukri</text><text start="60.079" dur="4.4">to all 180 meters away you won&amp;#39;t see it</text><text start="62.66" dur="5.159">right the like you just care about</text><text start="64.479" dur="5.14">understanding where we objects are and</text><text start="67.819" dur="3.87">out of their object that they should</text><text start="69.619" dur="3.831">care about or not then when it gets so</text><text start="71.689" dur="6.481">far becomes like I don&amp;#39;t like any port</text><text start="73.45" dur="7.9">okay it&amp;#39;s a curiosity some look at the</text><text start="78.17" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s the support cars I see Chevy bolt</text><text start="81.35" dur="5.609">and Prius which has you know has an</text><text start="84.38" dur="4.29">electric or hybrid drivetrain just kinda</text><text start="86.959" dur="5.82">curious is there any real difference</text><text start="88.67" dur="5.189">between developing open pipe or car that</text><text start="92.779" dur="3.711">uses an internal combustion engine</text><text start="93.859" dur="2.631">versus</text><text start="96.64" dur="5.47">it&amp;#39;s the same what&amp;#39;s up it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text><text start="99.77" dur="4.32">the same like everything is the same I</text><text start="102.11" dur="11.28">just said like if we go back to the</text><text start="104.09" dur="11.43">slide about how a pilot works so pretty</text><text start="113.39" dur="4.77">much every Kenichi VC from half of these</text><text start="115.52" dur="4.2">and Beyond is the same except like you</text><text start="118.16" dur="5.37">power it is that by effect are you</text><text start="119.72" dur="6.03">generate like the plane so if you can do</text><text start="123.53" dur="5.7">this like imagine like well actually we</text><text start="125.75" dur="5.16">do make like we might change the way</text><text start="129.23" dur="4.23">that the for example you generate the</text><text start="130.91" dur="4.26">flaming if your characters along with</text><text start="133.46" dur="4.92">the basics but like except your</text><text start="135.17" dur="4.77">prerogative that define the size of your</text><text start="138.38" dur="3.9">car everything that comes before</text><text start="139.94" dur="5.28">controls is up started from the specific</text><text start="142.28" dur="5.25">car every things that come after</text><text start="145.22" dur="3.9">controls and have to do with interfacing</text><text start="147.53" dur="4.65">with your gamma can be scarce Pacific</text><text start="149.12" dur="4.74">and generally like go back to your</text><text start="152.18" dur="3.09">question how much does it change its</text><text start="153.86" dur="2.31">combustion engine or like leather cap</text><text start="155.27" dur="4.29">not really</text><text start="156.17" dur="5.46">we found that casts that are hybrid are</text><text start="159.56" dur="4.71">a little more pleasant to control</text><text start="161.63" dur="6.829">because I feel it matters does it softer</text><text start="164.27" dur="4.189">off like it is the combustion engines</text><text start="176.03" dur="9.85">um so what the thing that I&amp;#39;m thinking</text><text start="182.24" dur="5.5">about is and this is you know me and my</text><text start="185.88" dur="4.5">my craziest and doesn&amp;#39;t have to do with</text><text start="187.74" dur="7.52">a lot with the self-driving car part but</text><text start="190.38" dur="6.48">with the the the the attention</text><text start="195.26" dur="3.97">measurement that you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="196.86" dur="4.26">looking at the person&amp;#39;s face yeah one</text><text start="199.23" dur="3.96">question I have is what&amp;#39;s your method</text><text start="201.12" dur="4.38">right now doing that are you looking for</text><text start="203.19" dur="4.29">you start training on a baseline of you</text><text start="205.5" dur="4.68">know 80% of the time somebody&amp;#39;s looking</text><text start="207.48" dur="4.59">in this orientation and so they deviate</text><text start="210.18" dur="4.32">from that for a certain period of time</text><text start="212.07" dur="4.44">and you sort of have a waiting algorithm</text><text start="214.5" dur="3.66">and finally when it trips you say okay</text><text start="216.51" dur="3.35">you&amp;#39;re not paying attention because you</text><text start="218.16" dur="4.26">haven&amp;#39;t been doing what you usually do</text><text start="219.86" dur="5.91">well so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text><text start="222.42" dur="5.67">abstracted like usually we found that we</text><text start="225.77" dur="4.3">iterated on the algorithm and we found</text><text start="228.09" dur="6.27">that actually people that pay attention</text><text start="230.07" dur="7.31">to their order they took straight your</text><text start="234.36" dur="6.12">hand is literally like kind of like like</text><text start="237.38" dur="5.32">thank you your eyes like your hand is</text><text start="240.48" dur="4.86">like perpendicular to today over them</text><text start="242.7" dur="4.08">yeah and we found that to be kind of</text><text start="245.34" dur="3.57">like the massed usable and best</text><text start="246.78" dur="4.08">indicator that makes the intention and</text><text start="248.91" dur="4.38">they makes it easy so what we do is like</text><text start="250.86" dur="4.08">we track like the angles like how your</text><text start="253.29" dur="4.199">head is oriented and then we have like</text><text start="254.94" dur="4.229">three shows over that depends like on</text><text start="257.489" dur="3.511">time for a longer you started and how</text><text start="259.169" dur="3.901">bad you like your to start out but</text><text start="261" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re looking away and so we combine</text><text start="263.07" dur="3.24">all those things and we have some sort</text><text start="264.45" dur="4.41">of like lay shoulder to issue like the</text><text start="266.31" dur="4.47">war and it makes it easy because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="268.86" dur="4.74">not for now it&amp;#39;s not going to dependent</text><text start="270.78" dur="4.08">for example life I like I like where</text><text start="273.6" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re looking because for example like</text><text start="274.86" dur="4.83">if you have a glasses sunglasses still</text><text start="277.38" dur="5.07">works however we want to make it back</text><text start="279.69" dur="5.64">there and when possible start to track</text><text start="282.45" dur="5.559">Isis where you can</text><text start="285.33" dur="5.47">this is the system are really not meant</text><text start="288.009" dur="4.41">to be not suitable like if you wanted to</text><text start="290.8" dur="3.569">see if you can the point of this system</text><text start="292.419" dur="3.54">is that they should they should remind</text><text start="294.369" dur="5.22">you how you should be you should be</text><text start="295.959" dur="4.8">eight right and still it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text><text start="299.589" dur="3.45">that it should be should it be better</text><text start="300.759" dur="3.63">than what they are and so everyone like</text><text start="303.039" dur="3.48">if you don&amp;#39;t have sunglasses you should</text><text start="304.389" dur="4.29">be able to try to track the ice movement</text><text start="306.519" dur="3.57">where your eyes are looking at and so</text><text start="308.679" dur="3.74">they are supposed to become better but</text><text start="310.089" dur="4.711">for now is like mainly like annotations</text><text start="312.419" dur="5.8">how far from from the what you are</text><text start="314.8" dur="6.239">looking for a lot and is that all that</text><text start="318.219" dur="4.831">module is that abstracted away from all</text><text start="321.039" dur="4.83">the rest of the open pilots stuff enough</text><text start="323.05" dur="4.53">to where you know you could install that</text><text start="325.869" dur="3.06">in a in a vehicle just to get those</text><text start="327.58" dur="4.739">alerts yes</text><text start="328.929" dur="5.28">so okay okay to clarify this is a very</text><text start="332.319" dur="5.19">good point I think you should topic type</text><text start="334.209" dur="5.01">IDs so they they come here which is like</text><text start="337.509" dur="5.61">the platform that we they are a platform</text><text start="339.219" dur="5.581">that we sell he by default doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="343.119" dur="4.681">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that doesn&amp;#39;t drive your</text><text start="344.8" dur="4.829">cover it comes with the driver system</text><text start="347.8" dur="4.349">feature this is called passive tiger</text><text start="349.629" dur="3.84">system features so he warns you if you</text><text start="352.149" dur="3.27">are about to collide with the cars it as</text><text start="353.469" dur="4.11">for a collision warning and it has two</text><text start="355.419" dur="4.381">other monitoring it s like speed sign</text><text start="357.579" dur="4.531">recognitions things that we can just</text><text start="359.8" dur="5.759">leverage without having to interact or</text><text start="362.11" dur="5.909">like control your account in addition to</text><text start="365.559" dur="5.97">that can become a development kit that</text><text start="368.019" dur="4.86">you can install any software it&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="371.529" dur="3.12">but the pilot which is the use of</text><text start="372.879" dur="3.96">software they can actually like to IDF</text><text start="374.649" dur="4.02">can actually but bots software starts</text><text start="376.839" dur="4.44">they are pretty much like very similar</text><text start="378.669" dur="4.89">to each other like the software that</text><text start="381.279" dur="3.57">comes before with the system and open</text><text start="383.559" dur="4.11">pilot they&amp;#39;re very short each other</text><text start="384.849" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re both open source and so yes you</text><text start="387.669" dur="3.21">don&amp;#39;t need to have like a sister that</text><text start="388.99" dur="3.87">you drive your car she just wanted</text><text start="390.879" dur="6.54">futures care about like system it tracks</text><text start="392.86" dur="6.899">your intentions works as a dash cam so</text><text start="397.419" dur="5.31">of course your drive but what driving</text><text start="399.759" dur="6.8">driver like the older and the internal</text><text start="402.729" dur="5.33">of the car and so yeah you can</text><text start="406.559" dur="3.21">you don&amp;#39;t need to use the specific</text><text start="408.059" dur="5.63">driving feature if you just care about</text><text start="409.769" dur="6.09">the Monaco features and are there any</text><text start="413.689" dur="4.3">sensors that you&amp;#39;re reading off of the</text><text start="415.859" dur="4.89">canvas that you absolutely have to have</text><text start="417.989" dur="4.59">there or there so you could actually</text><text start="420.749" dur="3.66">have a complete separated from any of</text><text start="422.579" dur="2.76">the electronics of the car is still</text><text start="424.409" dur="3">getting some of that</text><text start="425.339" dur="4.2">well yeah you should use TV and wiring</text><text start="427.409" dur="3.87">at least yeah monitoring for sure on a</text><text start="429.539" dur="4.97">speed sign of course because I can just</text><text start="431.279" dur="9.03">rely on like GPS like we have like GPS</text><text start="434.509" dur="10.81">like what open apps obvious like man he</text><text start="440.309" dur="7.5">was obviously mad no it&amp;#39;s like let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="445.319" dur="4.44">level level one like like here&amp;#39;s step</text><text start="447.809" dur="3.75">one is like you just you just have to</text><text start="449.759" dur="3.66">hear like in your car and it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="451.559" dur="3.96">connected to the can system of your of</text><text start="453.419" dur="4.32">the car and it just works as a dashcam I</text><text start="455.519" dur="3.18">still like dude a diaper monitoring if I</text><text start="457.739" dur="2.76">were cuz your warning</text><text start="458.699" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s all worse that&amp;#39;s that too is like</text><text start="460.499" dur="3.63">but you have a supported car you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="462.119" dur="4.14">connected to can see TV you don&amp;#39;t take</text><text start="464.129" dur="3.81">advantage of the driving features but</text><text start="466.259" dur="3.81">things are going to be better because</text><text start="467.939" dur="3.81">you take care of like you know exerted</text><text start="470.069" dur="4.17">by the speed of the carrier&amp;#39;s etc then</text><text start="471.749" dur="3.9">the next step after these it&amp;#39;s like when</text><text start="474.239" dur="4.38">you actually is lot of the pilot you</text><text start="475.649" dur="4.83">have this is too much really okay okay</text><text start="478.619" dur="6.9">so sort of like you can get like 25</text><text start="480.479" dur="7.23">things from from the system was that</text><text start="485.519" dur="4.7">sorry if I miss that you know I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="487.709" dur="2.51">say action</text><text start="493.439" dur="4.35">so in some cities with poor</text><text start="495.599" dur="4.35">infrastructure such as Albuquerque you</text><text start="497.789" dur="6.36">may have noticed some of the places you</text><text start="499.949" dur="6.601">can barely see lane markings and street</text><text start="504.149" dur="4.86">signs are missing or knocked over stuff</text><text start="506.55" dur="4.229">like that how well will the software</text><text start="509.009" dur="3.45">Adela learn to adapt for things like</text><text start="510.779" dur="4.74">that are you just gonna have to take</text><text start="512.459" dur="5.401">over anytime that the city you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="515.519" dur="5.341">driving and it has been infrastructure</text><text start="517.86" dur="6.299">well so we do I know for example we are</text><text start="520.86" dur="4.56">relying on the lane lines quite at least</text><text start="524.159" dur="3.3">okay kind of the right without lane</text><text start="525.42" dur="3.39">lines but it doesn&amp;#39;t work like a job</text><text start="527.459" dur="3.06">yeah it&amp;#39;s getting back there so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="528.81" dur="4.259">getting over the time is getting better</text><text start="530.519" dur="4.471">it&amp;#39;s getting like it is let you realize</text><text start="533.069" dur="3.27">less and less on the actual feature like</text><text start="534.99" dur="2.789">being pressed like pretty much like at</text><text start="536.339" dur="4.35">you but that&amp;#39;s a chemical driving if you</text><text start="537.779" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t say yeah one of us are driving and</text><text start="540.689" dur="3.71">there&amp;#39;s no lines we can kind of</text><text start="542.399" dur="4.531">extrapolate from where everyone else&amp;#39;s</text><text start="544.399" dur="4.151">yeah exactly so right now I would say</text><text start="546.93" dur="4.589">like it kind of depends on like for</text><text start="548.55" dur="15.87">example I clean lines safely but I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="551.519" dur="14.341">know I came down route 66 there&amp;#39;s a park</text><text start="564.42" dur="3.81">that have no lines for probably</text><text start="565.86" dur="5.25">quarter-mile and identified the sand one</text><text start="568.23" dur="8.45">side of the right line just the color of</text><text start="571.11" dur="5.57">the dirt out here Apple to do that yeah</text><text start="581.65" dur="5.8">we were teaching the system to identify</text><text start="584.42" dur="6.45">a license just abstract it from a</text><text start="587.45" dur="6.08">specific line line Caesar but the next</text><text start="590.87" dur="2.66">release is like</text><text start="613.09" dur="42.21">and so-and-so</text><text start="683.15" dur="3.33">what Soviet rip just cast away with</text><text start="685.85" dur="2.76">Megaten</text><text start="686.48" dur="4.5">and it&amp;#39;s an ongoing process I believe</text><text start="688.61" dur="4.44">that as of now we still have to do some</text><text start="690.98" dur="4.59">more homework and like making the system</text><text start="693.05" dur="4.11">better but like in parallel yes we will</text><text start="695.57" dur="4.8">be open to discuss we have done in the</text><text start="697.16" dur="3.869">past we want to keep doing it but yeah I</text><text start="700.37" dur="8.75">think they&amp;#39;re usually two people</text><text start="701.029" dur="10.801">homework it should be a good path yes</text><text start="709.12" dur="5.19">University supported vehicles the</text><text start="711.83" dur="4.74">different different cars have different</text><text start="714.31" dur="3.91">lower speed limits where they lose</text><text start="716.57" dur="3.93">steering their acceleration</text><text start="718.22" dur="6.48">functionality is a sense of limitation</text><text start="720.5" dur="7.8">or actuators and DC is that improving or</text><text start="724.7" dur="6.66">the cars getting better the figure is</text><text start="728.3" dur="5.49">getting better the point is that so</text><text start="731.36" dur="4.8">certain cars like we have to make it</text><text start="733.79" dur="3.57">with the cats so we are like MSL</text><text start="736.16" dur="2.85">everything is kind of abstracted from</text><text start="737.36" dur="4.02">the car but then at certain point the</text><text start="739.01" dur="4.35">last the end is like a dependent and so</text><text start="741.38" dur="4.08">we have to obey to attack there are</text><text start="743.36" dur="4.44">their constraints of the specific car</text><text start="745.46" dur="4.68">hands so if the specific cars locks you</text><text start="747.8" dur="4.83">are for controlling like the brake</text><text start="750.14" dur="4.8">giving to steal for
