dur="7.35">install up and pilot on it and you will</text><text start="334.26" dur="6.24">literally get dis this way no car but</text><text start="339.42" dur="2.85">you know okay</text><text start="340.5" dur="5.07">well let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s at least talk about how</text><text start="342.27" dur="6.15">I think I mean this is just people who</text><text start="345.57" dur="5.58">are behind but I think this is at least</text><text start="348.42" dur="4.98">this tastes right like this is much like</text><text start="351.15" dur="7.02">our Drive you right this is nothing

some</text><text start="368.22" dur="4.08">yes so just something to be aware of</text><text start="370.08" dur="4.41">they talk about how it&amp;#39;s 99% in</text><text start="372.3" dur="2.73">autonomous mode that doesn&amp;#39;t really mean</text><text start="374.49" dur="4.89">anything</text><text start="375.03" dur="6">um when 99% autonomous mode would mean</text><text start="379.38" dur="7.53">they do have a huge screen that does a</text><text start="381.03" dur="8.49">big Russian screen no but um 99 percent</text><text start="386.91" dur="5.31">doesn&amp;#39;t

also</text><text start="470.639" dur="3.24">probably get the BAE do satellites</text><text start="472.139" dur="4.77">bay-do uses the same frequency as GPS</text><text start="473.879" dur="6.361">beta

good</text><text start="481.349" dur="6.15">idea where would I put the mirrors know</text><text start="485.219" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;ll see what the solution is it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="487.499" dur="4.35">probably what you expect in order to get</text><text start="490.199" dur="3.661">to anything that requires that it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="491.849" dur="3.271">cameras but guys a lot of the</text><text start="493.86" dur="2.789">disengagement sweer still getting an</text><text start="495.12" dur="5.34">open pilot our biggest source of</text><text

dur="3.091">we&amp;#39;re gonna try to really drive</text><text start="502.8" dur="3.869">disengagement down but our biggest</text><text start="504.99" dur="4.199">source of disengage now is cutting and</text><text start="506.669" dur="4.68">there are visible cuttings so open pilot</text><text start="509.189" dur="4.861">only detects the cars in front of you</text><text start="511.349" dur="4.38">using the radar it doesn&amp;#39;t use the</text><text start="514.05" dur="3.45">camera it uses the camera for fusion</text><text start="515.729" dur="6.781">confirmation if the radar detects a</text><text start="517.5" dur="7.079">stopped object this is I mean you see</text><text start="522.51" dur="3.3">the auto pilot cars you see all the time</text><text start="524.579" dur="3.151">they crash into things in front of them</text><text start="525.81" dur="4.68">and this is the same bug because you</text><text start="527.73" dur="4.41">can&amp;#39;t just trust and we&amp;#39;ll get to why we</text><text start="530.49" dur="4.829">don&amp;#39;t use lidar in a minute you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="532.14" dur="4.92">just trust the radar because sometimes</text><text start="535.319" dur="5.13">radars will detect like manhole covers</text><text start="537.06" dur="4.95">or bridges as stopped cars and if you</text><text start="540.449" dur="3.69">guys in the Toyota sometime will</text><text start="542.01" dur="4.559">experience false braking so it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="544.139" dur="4.921">trade-off right a false positive means</text><text start="546.569" dur="4.351">hard braking but a true positive means</text><text start="549.06" dur="3">you crash into something right so you</text><text start="550.92" dur="3.719">want to get hit from the front of the</text><text start="552.06" dur="5.5">back so you got it you got to kind of</text><text start="554.639" dur="6.281">tune these things it&amp;#39;s a no-win scenario</text><text start="557.56" dur="7.71">the aschen marui why don&amp;#39;t we use</text><text start="560.92" dur="4.98">lighter so um the problem thank you</text><text start="565.27" dur="4.31">thank you</text><text start="565.9" dur="7.74">the problem with lidar is twofold one</text><text start="569.58" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s very expensive you if you what was</text><text start="573.64" dur="2.88">show me what lidar you can buy today</text><text start="575.02" dur="2.819">that&amp;#39;s reasonably priced and you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="576.52" dur="4.35">point I don&amp;#39;t look I can buy the slider</text><text start="577.839" dur="4.741">for five hundred dollars but just</text><text start="580.87" dur="3.39">because they&amp;#39;re both called lidar it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="582.58" dur="4.08">nothing like the kind of lidar you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="584.26" dur="4.56">find on lame-o cars so you say twelve</text><text start="586.66" dur="5.52">thousand which light are you talking</text><text start="588.82" dur="5.16">about and let me also remind you at</text><text start="592.18" dur="4.62">twelve thousand you can for twelve</text><text start="593.98" dur="4.83">thousand dollars you can buy twelve Eon</text><text start="596.8" dur="3.12">giraffe panda combinations that&amp;#39;s even</text><text start="598.81" dur="3.74">midnight black eons</text><text start="599.92" dur="4.98">maybe maybe normally on grey panda</text><text start="602.55" dur="8.11">giraffe with international shipping so</text><text start="604.9" dur="7.11">you can buy twelve exactly there are</text><text start="610.66" dur="6.78">certain control changes that can address</text><text start="612.01" dur="7.89">that let them yeah vision mark radar</text><text start="617.44" dur="4.649">yeah those things we can do better there</text><text start="619.9" dur="4.68">why can&amp;#39;t lie to our be made in mass</text><text start="622.089" dur="6.091">scale for much cheaper so there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="624.58" dur="5.16">fundamental reason that it can&amp;#39;t but no</text><text start="628.18" dur="3.03">companies have done it yet all right so</text><text start="629.74" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re not gonna spin up the comma a I</text><text start="631.21" dur="3.72">lied our division and try to make lidar</text><text start="633.52" dur="2.79">it makes no sense</text><text start="634.93" dur="4.83">Oster twelve thousand dollars is still</text><text start="636.31" dur="5.76">too much money now so there&amp;#39;s that</text><text start="639.76" dur="3.75">aspect to it um you know could you make</text><text start="642.07" dur="2.82">ladders cheaper yeah someone probably</text><text start="643.51" dur="4.23">well and then at that point we can we</text><text start="644.89" dur="4.8">can reevaluate our usage of lidar I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="647.74" dur="4.5">show you a Bosch radar image not sure</text><text start="649.69" dur="4.05">exactly we mean by that ladder will be</text><text start="652.24" dur="3.12">cheap is still five thousand is still</text><text start="653.74" dur="3.69">too much and then there&amp;#39;s also a</text><text start="655.36" dur="4.86">question of I&amp;#39;m not sure what you think</text><text start="657.43" dur="5.49">lighter gets you right lidar doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="660.22" dur="4.95">tell you how to drive a car all lidar</text><text start="662.92" dur="3.81">gives you is a depth based point cloud</text><text start="665.17" dur="4.38">of an environment you can do very</text><text start="666.73" dur="4.58">similar things today using even a single</text><text start="669.55" dur="5.85">camera combined with deep learning</text><text start="671.31" dur="10.21">obviously you can use let&amp;#39;s find mono</text><text start="675.4" dur="7.95">cam depth that&amp;#39;s right yeah that&amp;#39;s why I</text><text start="681.52" dur="2.369">mean by the $500 liners that aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="683.35" dur="8.779">really what you</text><text start="683.889" dur="19.62">what um so this one good this one&amp;#39;s old</text><text start="692.129" dur="12.46">there&amp;#39;s very good ones now let me find</text><text start="703.509" dur="3.83">the cityscapes</text><text start="704.589" dur="2.75">yep tonight</text><text start="709.65" dur="6.15">so my point is lidar is pretty similar</text><text start="713.76" dur="5.34">to a camera plus a depth now we used to</text><text start="715.8" dur="6.21">troll that we were going to put make a</text><text start="719.1" dur="9.36">box with a GPU and a camera and then</text><text start="722.01" dur="8.43">sell it as a lidar so you see the depths</text><text start="728.46" dur="4.44">there that are being returned as I</text><text start="730.44" dur="6.56">believe this is mono cabin might be</text><text start="732.9" dur="4.1">stereo cabinets it&amp;#39;s all very similar</text><text start="737.06" dur="7.27">yeah like you can infer depth this depth</text><text start="741" dur="7.41">ground truth was probably taken with a</text><text start="744.33" dur="5.94">liner and this is uh without the liner</text><text start="748.41" dur="3.09">you see this is even picking up on some</text><text start="750.27" dur="5.43">things that are not in the ground truth</text><text start="751.5" dur="5.85">like that tree over there oh yeah I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="755.7"
