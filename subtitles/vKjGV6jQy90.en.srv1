start="3037.97" dur="4.889">thanks Tesla</text><text start="3038.859" dur="5.771">so yeah so this text which is not</text><text start="3042.859" dur="4.081">visible on the UI with my current setup</text><text start="3044.63" dur="3.75">is now visible and I agree with George</text><text start="3046.94" dur="3.63">it does look better with the picture as</text><text start="3048.38" dur="3.66">the background so but then I noticed</text><text start="3050.57" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s this new line break between</text><text start="3052.04" dur="5.19">those two sets of data so I asked Gregg</text><text start="3055.04" dur="4.65">is there a reason for that because you</text><text start="3057.23" dur="5.07">can see actually apparently one of the</text><text start="3059.69" dur="5.159">ways in the smoking weed era to show my</text><text start="3062.3" dur="4.41">break is to just do none and that added</text><text start="3064.849" dur="4.311">the line break so but clearly that was</text><text start="3066.71" dur="4.47">an atom for no reason so I asked great</text><text start="3069.16" dur="6.01">great what the reason was he wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3071.18" dur="5.64">quite sure but he guessed that there is</text><text start="3075.17" dur="5.04">some sort of categorical separation</text><text start="3076.82" dur="4.86">there so in an attempt to retain the</text><text start="3080.21" dur="4.62">category separation categorical</text><text start="3081.68" dur="4.26">separation without without having a new</text><text start="3084.83" dur="2.789">line there because it was taking it more</text><text start="3085.94" dur="4.399">space I just removed the new line and</text><text start="3087.619" dur="6.271">then change this lower frost to orange</text><text start="3090.339" dur="5.981">had to find out how to do all that and</text><text start="3093.89" dur="3.66">was successful and there&amp;#39;s gonna be sort</text><text start="3096.32" dur="2.37">of a reveal at the end or whatever I</text><text start="3097.55" dur="2.7">just show you all that change limit</text><text start="3098.69" dur="11.07">anyway give us the reveal in one minute</text><text start="3100.25" dur="13.02">ok ok other other change I did was there</text><text start="3109.76" dur="6.599">was there&amp;#39;s a video that shows the</text><text start="3113.27" dur="5.16">trajectories on top of the area of</text><text start="3116.359" dur="3.901">interest and I wanted to put that up</text><text start="3118.43" dur="3.179">here because there&amp;#39;s a lot of wasted</text><text start="3120.26" dur="2.7">space just from a usability perspective</text><text start="3121.609" dur="3.061">there&amp;#39;s a lot of wasted space going on</text><text start="3122.96" dur="3.78">up here and basically anything outside</text><text start="3124.67" dur="4.26">of the bounding box we don&amp;#39;t really care</text><text start="3126.74" dur="3.629">about so from a visual perspective it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3128.93" dur="3.03">better just to have it in there so I</text><text start="3130.369" dur="3.151">kept this text</text><text start="3131.96" dur="3.69">move it over here get it up here put</text><text start="3133.52" dur="5.46">that put the other box up here to the</text><text start="3135.65" dur="8.4">divinium video which is a shout out of</text><text start="3138.98" dur="6.33">it and then yeah and then starting</text><text start="3144.05" dur="3.299">something massaging text moving things</text><text start="3145.31" dur="3">around massages and then the plot moves</text><text start="3147.349" dur="22.791">out of the way so I started massaging</text><text start="3148.31" dur="24.51">plot spacing in my UI oh so so yeah so</text><text start="3170.14" dur="4.27">now we have the video in video so as</text><text start="3172.82" dur="3.779">we&amp;#39;re taking advantage of the wasted</text><text start="3174.41" dur="4.08">space above all so it&amp;#39;s aligned with the</text><text start="3176.599" dur="4.801">image below in order to basically have a</text><text start="3178.49" dur="5.04">little easier visual acuity this is</text><text start="3181.4" dur="5.07">still taking advantage of being on top</text><text start="3183.53" dur="5.04">of the background and now because the</text><text start="3186.47" dur="3.78">default setting on the text for enabled</text><text start="3188.57" dur="3.9">and brake light is black we can actually</text><text start="3190.25" dur="5.22">see you know when it&amp;#39;s not being engaged</text><text start="3192.47" dur="4.56">effectively also I moved this map up so</text><text start="3195.47" dur="2.82">we can make sure and see the car and the</text><text start="3197.03" dur="2.94">reason why this text is alright to</text><text start="3198.29" dur="4.25">overlap is because the farther we get</text><text start="3199.97" dur="5.45">away from the front of the car the less</text><text start="3202.54" dur="6.49">is effectively so it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="3205.42" dur="5.11">enjoin the on the you whatever the</text><text start="3209.03" dur="3.87">debugging aspect of which is what we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="3210.53" dur="4.829">using this for and then I got the plot I</text><text start="3212.9" dur="4.89">you know matplotlib as we all know is</text><text start="3215.359" dur="4.771">not easy to use but I was able to</text><text start="3217.79" dur="4.65">massage these into space so that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="3220.13" dur="3.479">still seeing the data and the last thing</text><text start="3222.44" dur="5.88">that I was working on but wasn&amp;#39;t able to</text><text start="3223.609" dur="6.301">do was get these labels to match the</text><text start="3228.32" dur="4.83">color of the gas line that would seem to</text><text start="3229.91" dur="10.89">be that makes a lot more sense than a</text><text start="3233.15" dur="9.48">little parenthesis that we have the UI</text><text start="3240.8" dur="3.36">has not been shown much longer okay so</text><text start="3242.63" dur="2.85">now the very last that was that was</text><text start="3244.16" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s mostly what I did and then the</text><text start="3245.48" dur="7.23">very last little thing is that as we can</text><text start="3248.93" dur="5.909">see here with this system is based on</text><text start="3252.71" dur="4.2">pygame and pygame</text><text start="3254.839" dur="5.191">works quite well but here&amp;#39;s the thing</text><text start="3256.91" dur="5.04">pygame quite understandably has self</text><text start="3260.03" dur="4.829">promotion needs and so as you can see</text><text start="3261.95" dur="3.55">every time we invoke the UI piking gets</text><text start="3264.859" dur="2.651">their little</text><text start="3265.5" dur="3.63">husband in that hello from the PI game</text><text start="3267.51" dur="3.54">community which is overwhelming you know</text><text start="3269.13" dur="3.09">okay well so then I didn&amp;#39;t like that I</text><text start="3271.05" dur="2.52">don&amp;#39;t want I mean no offense the flag</text><text start="3272.22" dur="3.06">game we love them and all that but I</text><text start="3273.57" dur="4.92">just personally didn&amp;#39;t want to see that</text><text start="3275.28" dur="4.77">so I first got rid of it and I thought</text><text start="3278.49" dur="20.61">no but we still want to prompt so I</text><text start="3280.05" dur="25.44">added a combo prompt everyone in 2%</text><text start="3299.1" dur="7.5">preventer no no all right I said we were</text><text start="3305.49" dur="6.36">gonna shout it out but we&amp;#39;re not really</text><text start="3306.6" dur="6.93">gonna oh well actually gonna all go in</text><text start="3311.85" dur="4.83">the back home employees after this and</text><text start="3313.53" dur="32.7">decide who wins the prizes oh we can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3316.68" dur="31.02">be bribed yeah but you&amp;#39;re do that</text><text start="3346.23" dur="3.41">dashboard</text><text start="3347.7" dur="6.629">people love dashboards I don&amp;#39;t know why</text><text start="3349.64" dur="9.01">and so basically what I did</text><text start="3354.329" dur="7.17">2092 k-19 and flipped around the process</text><text start="3358.65" dur="6.27">readers to a non processed readers it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3361.499" dur="5.22">running currently on a branch and might</text><text start="3364.92" dur="4.679">get a hackathon if you want to get a</text><text start="3366.719" dur="5.78">ticket do whatever you want with it but</text><text start="3369.599" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s really cute I to be aware of that</text><text start="3372.499" dur="8.44">instead of numpy basically we&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="3375.119" dur="8.19">burning all of everything this one it</text><text start="3380.939" dur="5.64">should be what is that</text><text start="3383.309" dur="6.69">yes we&amp;#39;re downloading the entire 22 K 19</text><text start="3386.579" dur="5.91">data set right and then we go and we</text><text start="3389.999" dur="5.22">extract all the values which was kind of</text><text start="3392.489" dur="5.25">hard to do but that&amp;#39;s good so I just</text><text start="3395.219" dur="4.23">simplify the whole bunch for loops and</text><text start="3397.739" dur="4.141">then I brought them in and I made a</text><text start="3399.449" dur="4.711">dashboard which doesn&amp;#39;t really work but</text><text start="3401.88" dur="3.659">should eventually we have some display</text><text start="3404.16" dur="3.75">issues around saying there&amp;#39;s a for some</text><text start="3405.539" dur="7.23">reason and so you just go down here just</text><text start="3407.91" dur="8.159">running off iPod widgets as well a few</text><text start="3412.769" dur="5.55">other simple technologies and you should</text><text start="3416.069" dur="5.4">be let&amp;#39;s do just put spacer and we&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="3418.319" dur="5.37">get the full dear friend there with the</text><text start="3421.469" dur="5.001">query and then we can do is coordinate</text><text start="3423.689" dur="6.351">map which is not gonna be out</text><text start="3426.47" dur="4.74">it was taken I like this one I think we</text><text start="3430.04" dur="5.789">can do better and I think we can scale</text><text start="3431.21" dur="6.659">it and then the speed verse bearing just</text><text start="3435.829" dur="3.691">to show it&amp;#39;s kind of possible and this</text><text start="3437.869" dur="2.761">is the Geo map to show that a map was</text><text start="3439.52" dur="6.599">supposed to be there but I couldn&amp;#39;t get</text><text start="3440.63" dur="9.449">a display that&amp;#39;s all hey yeah could you</text><text start="3446.119" dur="4.921">tell people to get their asking you okey</text><text start="3450.079" dur="3.51">whoa cool</text><text start="3451.04" dur="3.539">okay um so remember how I said YouTube</text><text start="3453.589" dur="3.48">was gonna come in the back to the</text><text start="3454.579" dur="10.021">judgment session they&amp;#39;re not sorry you</text><text start="3457.069" dur="10.001">two bye bye you two</text><text start="3464.6"
