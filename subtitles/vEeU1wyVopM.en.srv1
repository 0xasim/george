dur="4.081">wear that twenty billion miles that we</text><text start="79.56" dur="3.629">have driven actually so what it means is</text><text start="81.99" dur="3.419">that the more data you have the

how many</text><text start="646.87" dur="11.969">you have a lidar I would say</text><text start="657.12" dur="4.24">pragmatically we gotta get rid of the</text><text start="658.839" dur="4.951">lidar but we use it down University</text><text start="661.36" dur="5.57">currently because it makes some things a</text><text start="663.79" dur="3.14">lot simpler so yeah</text><text start="670.51" dur="4.87">to symbol is also a vision based</text><text start="672.769" dur="5.491">solution our camper actually can be over</text><text start="675.38" dur="5.25">a thousand meters away which is quite</text><text start="678.26" dur="3.96">substantial especially for turkey you</text><text start="680.63" dur="4.5">have to longer stop with a search for</text><text start="682.22" dur="4.65">big

start="699.44" dur="6.12">redundancy and bring out somewhere in a</text><text start="701.899" dur="5.461">stable system yeah it&amp;#39;s just all about</text><text start="705.56" dur="3.51">redundancy and kind of giving the</text><text start="707.36" dur="4.08">impression to people that they are safe</text><text start="709.07" dur="3.959">I mean yes we do have dual ice and we</text><text start="711.44" dur="2.759">trust our eyes sometimes we take them</text><text start="713.029" dur="3.601">take our bikes off the road and instead</text><text start="714.199" dur="4.44">expect a partner to write itself but</text><text start="716.63" dur="4.949">leaving that aside I mean if I gave you</text><text start="718.639" dur="4.38">a car with just one camera people do</text><text start="721.579" dur="3.391">tend to get a little bit nervous so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="723.019" dur="3.361">probably more of a phase where we need</text><text start="724.97" dur="3.21">to tell you that no there&amp;#39;s more than</text><text start="726.38" dur="4.139">one non sensor that&amp;#39;s taking care of you</text><text start="728.18" dur="5.339">so it&amp;#39;s all about no pun intended</text><text start="730.519" dur="5.82">perception but over time yes I do think</text><text start="733.519" dur="4.771">mission will I mean there&amp;#39;s nothing grew</text><text start="736.339" dur="3.99">enough to communicate of us being safe</text><text start="738.29" dur="3.85">in our cars but it&amp;#39;s just more of an</text><text start="740.329"
