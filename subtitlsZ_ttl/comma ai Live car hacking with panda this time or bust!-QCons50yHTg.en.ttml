<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">time you can see that I&#39;ve added</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">something to the Panda examples repo</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">called query VIN you can see right here</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">this is the VIN number of my car what</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be playing with today is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">it turns out that a lot of cars don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">actually have messages being sent on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">canvas you&#39;re gonna have to send</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">commands to it in order to get the car</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">to tell you things if you look at these</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">obd2 pigs so you know when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">every other car dongle this is what they</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">can get these standard PIDs close up the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">window standard PID so to show you PID</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.229" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">supported engine load fuel pressure rpm</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">vehicle speed that kind of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try to make some of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">queries today so I&#39;ve written a script</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">called query VIN I committed it to panda</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:59.150" style="s2">examples this morning we take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.150" end="00:02:04.470" style="s2">it sends some stuff it&#39;s really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">terribly written code um so we should do</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.470" end="00:02:12.200" style="s2">a little bit of refactoring so can you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.200" style="s2">guys we&#39;ll see if I make them that big</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:23.670" style="s2">ice OTP is a standard on top of can that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">let&#39;s it kind of packet eyes can because</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.670" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">can has only a eight byte limit per</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">message so if you want to send things</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">that are more than eight bytes you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">to packetize them</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">so first let&#39;s try something so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">actually setting the safety mode on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">panda remember pandas can&#39;t transmit by</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:43.940" style="s2">default setting the safety mode to wall</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">output so let&#39;s see if we can instead</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.940" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">set the safety mode to elm isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">documented here so we&#39;re gonna add this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:03:03.299" style="s2">we can find this in the board go get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:09.299" style="s2">safety cage yeah e3 to 7 is Elm let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.299" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">just add this here also we have safety</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.299" end="00:03:29.549" style="s2">toyotas board here better way yes make</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:35.549" style="s2">sure my panda repose update everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.549" end="00:03:38.580" style="s2">origin that&#39;s very cool already okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.549" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">cool so let&#39;s see what happens if I set</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.580" end="00:03:42.390" style="s2">the safety mode so first of all I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">show you guys what happens if I set the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.390" end="00:03:48.450" style="s2">safety mode to no out shouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">yeah so it sends but it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.450" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">send it sounds nothing so if I set the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:56.820" style="s2">safety mode instead to elm327 I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">to look up every once in a while to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.820" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">you guys on the chat still doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">works if I set it to all output but only</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:30.460" style="s2">all output when I was working I set it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:35.130" style="s2">out interest maybe LM isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.460" end="00:04:35.130" style="s2">triggering a reinitialize ation of can</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.600" end="00:04:54.010" style="s2">read the code so if I look in main here</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:56.100" style="s2">this is set safety mode should trigger a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.010" end="00:05:02.889" style="s2">cannon at all</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.100" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">why doesn&#39;t work so it&#39;s weird if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.889" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">toggle from no outputs or it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:14.860" style="s2">work then I changed elm327 it still</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t know it works the second</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.860" end="00:05:23.139" style="s2">time okay so the first time I just must</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">be clogged up with crap cool so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.139" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">good to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:28.360" style="s2">so now let&#39;s see if we can make some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">these other queries to the car the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.360" end="00:05:34.680" style="s2">request that I&#39;m making for the VIN is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">own I know to equals gab move in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.680" end="00:05:42.010" style="s2">then I&#39;m doing a iso TP receive so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:45.789" style="s2">believe if I recall correctly 7d F is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.010" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">broadcast address and 78 is the address</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.789" end="00:05:51.190" style="s2">I expect to hear back from the ECU on</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:54.370" style="s2">let&#39;s see what other queries I can make</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">here I hope this is still visible to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">guys yeah I still read the Wikipedia I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">just on the obd2 bids Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:08.600" style="s2">yeah this will be in the Panda repo I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:10.130" style="s2">gonna push whenever I&#39;m done um that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.600" end="00:06:12.290" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the can bus that was finicky I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.130" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">find the campus is actually super</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.290" end="00:06:18.740" style="s2">reliable so you see right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:21.140" style="s2">sending a PID 9 yeah text is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.740" end="00:06:27.800" style="s2">read okay I can try to zoom in a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.140" end="00:06:30.890" style="s2">bit more mode 9 PID 2 is the vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.800" end="00:06:33.980" style="s2">identification number it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.890" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">unreadable shouldn&#39;t be it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.980" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">readable here oh yeah okay I can see why</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of hard to read let me zoom</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">in a little more I&#39;ll keep it at 100</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:57.230" style="s2">I&#39;ll make it fullscreen if I have to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:07:03.350" style="s2">is 4 bytes what&#39;s 4 bytes so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.230" end="00:07:07.340" style="s2">send a mode 9 that can request the VIN</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.350" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">message count in pit usually value will</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.340" end="00:07:16.670" style="s2">be 5 calibration ID what&#39;s a calibration</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:18.410" style="s2">ID so I found that cars call things I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.670" end="00:07:20.480" style="s2">need to start live streaming on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:22.040" style="s2">you have people tell me this I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.480" end="00:07:29.870" style="s2">Twitter fanboy you know you know I love</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.040" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">the Twitter let&#39;s see what the ECU name</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.870" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">is let&#39;s see if we can request that Oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.550" end="00:07:52.670" style="s2">ECM engine control cool so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:54.290" style="s2">break out my ISO teepee library a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.670" end="00:07:57.920" style="s2">bit I think we can actually eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.290" end="00:08:02.600" style="s2">just make this part of Panda so this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.920" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">a 2017 rav4 so up here is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.600" end="00:08:07.930" style="s2">ISO TV library so let me just break that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:07.930" style="s2">out to ISO GP dot</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.000" end="00:08:13.630" style="s2">so much worse at using computers when</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.620" end="00:08:18.490" style="s2">people are watching me even anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.630" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">people on the Internet oh yeah cool so</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.490" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">now I can say from ISO TP in porch</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:28.380" style="s2">I said TP send this computer see you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:31.030" style="s2">pass in the Panda as the first argument</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.380" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">so won&#39;t push this little library here</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.030" end="00:08:36.729" style="s2">on so you guys will be able to do this</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">stuff in your car so that&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.729" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">broadcast let&#39;s see if we can find any</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">other ECU&#39;s in this car</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:44.709" style="s2">let&#39;s also just text up that red because</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t actually think I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.709" end="00:08:56.529" style="s2">getting more information than what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">there yeah look I&#39;m getting this well</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.820" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s part of the VIN response oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">I&#39;m not you unpacking that cool I&#39;m so</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.410" end="00:15:22.569" style="s2">know it works yeah that works</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.999" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">no that one&#39;s responded to me</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.589" end="00:16:16.819" style="s2">deal with the vision only ACC before if</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.869" end="00:16:20.869" style="s2">somebody shows me that they have a car</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.819" end="00:16:23.389" style="s2">that they can control then I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.869" end="00:16:30.199" style="s2">happily spend some time and fix it for</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.389" end="00:16:32.419" style="s2">you it already kind of works too I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.199" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">know if anyone&#39;s actually tried it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.419" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">if you comment up the other radar it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:38.329" style="s2">work okay cool so it looks like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:43.779" style="s2">actually getting responses from these</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.329" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">ECU&#39;s what&#39;s ever on B 0 C 0 and D 0</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.779" end="00:16:50.379" style="s2">they&#39;re just not so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">do right now is two things first off I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.379" end="00:16:54.819" style="s2">have to add Elm support to a not male</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:57.910" style="s2">but like ad standard PID support to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.819" end="00:17:00.279" style="s2">shiver um the other thing I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.910" end="00:17:03.790" style="s2">is figure out how to knock out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.279" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">driving support ECU in the Toyotas so</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.790" end="00:17:08.740" style="s2">the driving support ECU is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:11.860" style="s2">responsible for the onboard fairly low</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.740" end="00:17:13.240" style="s2">quality adaptive cruise control we want</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.860" end="00:17:14.260" style="s2">to knock it out and we wanna replace it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:16.059" style="s2">with comet adaptive cruise control</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.260" end="00:17:18.339" style="s2">because it&#39;s way better so for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.059" end="00:17:20.650" style="s2">lateral we can actually just unplug the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.339" end="00:17:22.900" style="s2">the camera module the driving support</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.650" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">ECU is hidden much deeper in the car and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.900" end="00:17:26.919" style="s2">we want to keep our brand-new rav4 as</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.289" style="s2">pristine as possible so we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.919" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">to do it with software now realistically</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.289" end="00:17:36.520" style="s2">probably the right idea here is for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">to get the Toyota text stream software</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.520" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">hey do I want Japanese food that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:44.740" style="s2">of tempting but then I gotta switch off</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">periscope um yes oppa violet can already</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.740" end="00:17:50.169" style="s2">do vision uh yeah yeah I could go for</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:22.450" style="s2">out radar D it&#39;s gonna take a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.970" end="00:18:25.059" style="s2">effort than that no no no we have an</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.450" end="00:18:27.010" style="s2">internal slack but we need more</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.059" end="00:18:30.100" style="s2">computers no we need that we walk the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.010" end="00:18:35.740" style="s2">talkies right I need more phone so have</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.720" end="00:19:19.590" style="s2">gonna deal with the main ECU for now but</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.820" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that those things do</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.590" end="00:19:30.929" style="s2">respond Jessie the contractor who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">the panda elm software for us had some</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.929" end="00:19:35.850" style="s2">pretty good comments about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:47.700" style="s2">let&#39;s see what you wrote so our stuff is</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.370" end="00:21:59.500" style="s2">what we can find that&#39;s not I self and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.220" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">so this is like yeah how to request you</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.870" end="00:22:06.140" style="s2">game this is how I figured out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">that VIN request you know what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.140" end="00:22:10.030" style="s2">just figure it off a little Kapiti pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.030" style="s2">just can&#39;t be that hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.990" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">so these pigs are like the standard ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.380" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">they&#39;re used by like emissions people</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">see mode five just modify redo they come</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:31.910" style="s2">in with the different modes of arson</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:34.010" style="s2">where this motor mold want the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.910" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">exceptions are PID one which is only</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.010" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">available in mode one and PID two which</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:41.480" style="s2">is only available in mode tool oh here</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">we go show current data all right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:46.850" style="s2">that&#39;s mode once</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:54.980" style="s2">let me just try sending a100 and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.850" end="00:22:57.860" style="s2">what happens so we&#39;re sending engine ECU</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.980" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">we&#39;re receiving it from the engine ECU I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.860" end="00:23:02.350" style="s2">just read that it&#39;s supposed to be +8</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">let&#39;s see what this does</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.350" end="00:23:08.780" style="s2">well cool gives me some stuff okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:10.850" style="s2">this is allegedly the PIDs supported and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.780" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">I believe it&#39;s bit encoded yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.850" end="00:23:18.790" style="s2">been encoded okay so let me just start</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.390" end="00:23:36.020" style="s2">writing this standard quickly um very</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.790" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">poor dead PIDs then it looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.020" end="00:23:42.470" style="s2">cons responds from MSB to LSB he&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:44.390" style="s2">first aw I guess it starts with 1</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.470" end="00:23:49.040" style="s2">because 0 pit is always supported and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.390" end="00:23:54.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m sending ok so just make</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.040" end="00:23:56.420" style="s2">a get PID D I should name the thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.410" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">correctly the mode 1 what didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.420" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">where did they use get get current now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:26.120" style="s2">just say red equal get data for PID 0</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:36.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the works I remove this extra</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.120" end="00:24:38.150" style="s2">debug crap from here yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.530" end="00:24:46.790" style="s2">don&#39;t really write in a Python 3</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.150" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">compatible way Python 3 is a disaster so</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.790" end="00:24:53.419" style="s2">we can find out this getting bin doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.870" style="s2">any more cool so those are my supported</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.419" end="00:24:56.679" style="s2">pets</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.870" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">now it&#39;s MSB for</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.679" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">so what&#39;s the easiest way to do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.609" end="00:25:25.299" style="s2">support it equals that I wanna do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.379" end="00:25:25.299" style="s2">too strong and I should see anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:53.329" style="s2">page 132 was the max you see below X 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.479" end="00:25:54.709" style="s2">is the max 20 yeah y equals 1 to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.329" end="00:26:02.899" style="s2">infinity I mean you can do that if your</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.709" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">language is lazy I think your Friday</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.899" end="00:26:10.789" style="s2">equals 1 to infinity I mean just wow I</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:16.729" style="s2">plus 1 box if supported and 1 2 3</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.789" end="00:26:26.839" style="s2">watch it watch oh I support it if left</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.729" end="00:26:28.339" style="s2">equals y guy should standardize</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.839" end="00:26:37.339" style="s2">something I shouldn&#39;t call one of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.339" end="00:26:38.989" style="s2">query and one of them yeah let&#39;s did I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.339" end="00:26:40.249" style="s2">take that word query from somewhere I</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.989" end="00:26:48.589" style="s2">try to make things as standard as</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.249" end="00:26:55.159" style="s2">possible unsupported types for tuple and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.589" end="00:26:57.950" style="s2">Aunty add extract okay cool so those are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.159" end="00:27:01.070" style="s2">the supported pads for the car so we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.950" end="00:27:07.369" style="s2">get calculated engine load we can get</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:10.220" style="s2">long term fuel trims we can get intake</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.369" end="00:27:15.650" style="s2">manifold pressure wait I can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.220" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">engine rpm now that&#39;s weak I just made a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.650" end="00:27:46.419" style="s2">mistake trihex thumping get current-day</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:46.419" style="s2">- my flat for PID 168 I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:28:00.409" style="s2">data for PID let&#39;s try okay so 12 should</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.990" end="00:28:06.770" style="s2">be the engine rpm seem like it says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.409" end="00:28:10.730" style="s2">not supported and yet stepper motor</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.770" end="00:28:14.330" style="s2">designed to control car all question the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.730" end="00:28:16.070" style="s2">safety of those things uh but if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.330" end="00:28:21.530" style="s2">have one I mean I&#39;m not sure we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.070" end="00:28:23.419" style="s2">really review it I mean I can look at it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.530" end="00:28:25.539" style="s2">like you posted on everything really the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.419" end="00:28:29.270" style="s2">way to do it is like posted on github</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.539" end="00:28:30.530" style="s2">and yeah so you got you got to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.270" end="00:28:33.860" style="s2">you do it safely so if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.530" end="00:28:35.960" style="s2">build a external steering control you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.860" end="00:28:39.289" style="s2">need two things to be enforced by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.960" end="00:28:41.750" style="s2">hardware practically you need a torque</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.289" end="00:28:45.740" style="s2">limit and you need a disengagement</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.750" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2"> side so yeah I mean posted on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.740" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.250" end="00:28:55.059" style="s2">we have a community going our slack and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">see what you love to say okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.059" end="00:29:00.190" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:29:09.640" style="s2">oh that&#39;s the PID wait</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.190" end="00:29:09.640" style="s2">mode 1 PID zero our quest for this PID</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.610" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.510" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">like I&#39;m sure this car can fetch the RPM</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.560" end="00:29:33.230" style="s2">between monitor idea supported okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:36.860" style="s2">let&#39;s look at this mode thing happens if</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.230" end="00:29:38.390" style="s2">Neo CPU fails um also they&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.860" end="00:29:40.220" style="s2">sending messages to the car</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.390" end="00:29:46.910" style="s2">so the dashboard will turn orange you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.220" end="00:29:49.220" style="s2">get the lights you&#39;ll get beeps well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.910" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">can request trouble codes with mode</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.220" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">three wow that&#39;s actually really easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:30:03.680" style="s2">updo that only other easy use as well by</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">the way I&#39;m watching the stream and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.680" end="00:30:09.350" style="s2">really laggy is it lagging for you too</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:10.760" style="s2">well you&#39;re actually seeing up to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.350" end="00:30:13.100" style="s2">minute what I&#39;m doing like when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.760" end="00:30:18.500" style="s2">I&#39;m like I ran query van I ran query van</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.100" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">does that work no like okay it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.500" end="00:30:22.370" style="s2">likes for me weird um that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:24.200" style="s2">thought it was broken before</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.370" end="00:30:30.020" style="s2">silky-smooth that&#39;s what I like to hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.200" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the engine rpm um let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.020" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">see community according to this can we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:39.020" style="s2">request the throttle position position</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">is 17 which isn&#39;t here either yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.020" end="00:30:49.850" style="s2">know it works</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:55.270" style="s2">weird did I write this code wrong all</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.850" end="00:30:55.270" style="s2">maybe things aren&#39;t sent as MSB</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.460" end="00:31:01.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">each bit from MSB to LSB I did that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.850" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">right seven eight nine oh oh oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:27.409" style="s2">cuz this is that after after the big</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:30.950" style="s2">endian here actually let me actually do</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.409" end="00:31:31.340" style="s2">proper big endian like that ah much</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.950" end="00:31:34.820" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.340" end="00:31:36.740" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a lot more sensible now can</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.820" end="00:31:46.460" style="s2">I get things like the wattle position in</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.740" end="00:31:50.779" style="s2">rpm yes I can 17 and 12 so let&#39;s make a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.460" end="00:31:52.820" style="s2">little loop here want extract the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.779" end="00:31:56.200" style="s2">current data for the pin so I know that</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.940" end="00:36:16.700" style="s2">well 20 gets you more pids for to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.779" end="00:36:20.289" style="s2">you more PIDs okay so we&#39;ll have those</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.700" end="00:36:21.559" style="s2">two might get supported pids function</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.289" end="00:36:23.450" style="s2">all right</p>
