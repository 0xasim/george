<p begin="00:18:38.809" end="00:18:43.700" style="s2">want to make the experience as good as</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.000" end="00:18:45.649" style="s2">possible right but think of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.700" end="00:18:47.059" style="s2">experience more like maybe the hard part</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.649" end="00:18:48.860" style="s2">of the experience not the soft part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.059" end="00:18:50.299" style="s2">the experience mistakes maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.860" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">change our email to the hardware support</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.299" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">a comment oh it&#39;s not a bad idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:58.490" style="s2">yeah I think that does make it a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">bit more clear yeah because to be only</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.490" end="00:19:04.899" style="s2">said yeah cuz we only sell hardware yeah</p>
