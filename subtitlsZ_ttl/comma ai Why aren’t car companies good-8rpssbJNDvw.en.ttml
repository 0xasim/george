<p begin="00:00:47.140" end="00:00:53.500" style="s2">the CoV Gail put it against code names</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.430" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">here we got code names gonna be on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.500" end="00:01:04.420" style="s2">phone mount for now okay get in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">frame turn it sideways we&#39;re excited to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.420" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">hear about power companies yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:12.939" style="s2">yeah welcome to uh his periscope good</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:14.799" style="s2">thing I&#39;m on my high quality iPhone X</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.939" end="00:01:19.869" style="s2">here where you can see great things on</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.799" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">camera top yeah so what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.869" end="00:01:23.890" style="s2">about is is you know I&#39;ve been hacking</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:26.890" style="s2">cell phones for a long time it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.890" end="00:01:28.420" style="s2">what I do how I used to be and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.890" end="00:01:30.070" style="s2">just having the Toyota ECU&#39;s and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.420" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">talking about how Toyota you see you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.070" end="00:01:34.540" style="s2">look a lot like 1990s cell phones I</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:35.890" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t even mean this is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.540" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">insult right I don&#39;t even mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.890" end="00:01:40.060" style="s2">like oh yeah we&#39;re ripping on Toyota but</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:42.280" style="s2">when you think about what was added like</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.060" end="00:01:44.860" style="s2">there&#39;s not only no security and these</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.280" end="00:01:46.750" style="s2">ECU&#39;s there&#39;s no integrity checks really</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.860" end="00:01:48.460" style="s2">there&#39;s no like strong integrity checks</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.750" end="00:01:50.710" style="s2">they don&#39;t do like a Shah of the data</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.460" end="00:01:53.020" style="s2">and compare it to a hash right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.710" end="00:01:55.750" style="s2">think of it like you can&#39;t have security</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.020" end="00:01:58.300" style="s2">without integrity integrity is checking</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.750" end="00:02:03.130" style="s2">for accidental bit flips security is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.300" end="00:02:06.310" style="s2">checking for malicious bit flips but</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.130" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">yeah so they don&#39;t there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.310" end="00:02:10.420" style="s2">security but oh these issues all filled</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:11.470" style="s2">by the companies that ship the cars no</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.420" end="00:02:15.090" style="s2">sword</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.470" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">these Toyota use user felt like again so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.090" end="00:02:21.400" style="s2">practically den so I don&#39;t own by Toyota</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:22.870" style="s2">like react built Honda but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">really owned by Toyota because genso</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.870" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">also built easy use for Subarus</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.430" end="00:02:38.099" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an awesome build CPU search</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">they&#39;ll decease ubers yeah so I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.099" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">know to be honest I always talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:43.709" style="s2">how the car companies are really just</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">marketing agencies and integrators yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.709" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">they yeah so this is a Paul Graham tweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">that we just talked about and it said</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">when the iPhone came out every phone</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">manufacturer understood that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:59.250" style="s2">to copy the iPhone when the Model S came</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">out the car manufacturers still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">understand that they need to copy the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">Model S I mean maybe they understand but</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">they&#39;re just not don&#39;t have the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:10.290" style="s2">company to to make these changes right</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">if they buy all these easy-to-use from</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.290" end="00:03:14.430" style="s2">other companies you have this five year</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.799" style="s2">cycle like they&#39;re just not theirs can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.430" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s not even like and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.799" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">what&#39;s next in the five year cycle right</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:23.069" style="s2">their development roadmaps are not very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">secret it&#39;s not like they&#39;re planning to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.069" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">put big powerful Linux computers in cars</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:32.299" style="s2">any time soon I just don&#39;t see it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">maybe maybe they have this fear of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.299" end="00:03:36.750" style="s2">computers in general because of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:38.549" style="s2">five-year like updates right maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">don&#39;t want to put like didn&#39;t use them</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.549" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">Danis thin because they&#39;re like in five</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">years gonna be old anyway and then as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">result they put even older shit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:47.579" style="s2">yeah I mean yeah I guess what they would</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">have to do is really separate out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.579" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">hardware and the car base from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">software yeah yeah yeah make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">them I think it&#39;s all kind of it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">kind of you the same but like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">even 2000 era cellphones I used to hack</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">2007 is like Motorola RAZR kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:03.900" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re not the security&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">nowhere near on the level of like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.900" end="00:04:09.870" style="s2">iPhone security but it&#39;s way better than</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">these ECU&#39;s which look literally like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.870" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">like they look like Nokia you know Nokia</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.120" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">shit phones I mean for example you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">just go by how much flash they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">right so so then the old Toyota ECU&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:29.100" style="s2">had 512 K of flash and the new Toyota</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">issues have 1.5 mix this Wow and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.100" end="00:04:32.850" style="s2">even more horrifying is that it uses all</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">this code like the code is is spaghetti</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.850" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">code written in C I mean at first when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">saw this code at first when I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:41.940" style="s2">reversing the first ECU the accurate ups</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">I thought it had to be generated I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.940" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">thought that it had to be like okay this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">is written and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">MATLAB and then there&#39;s some plugin</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:52.350" style="s2">which but it&#39;s not like the more you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:55.020" style="s2">look at it you realize that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:56.670" style="s2">handwritten C that&#39;s being compiled yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.020" end="00:04:58.170" style="s2">but maybe that&#39;s exactly weather so they</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.670" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">have so much trouble going away from me</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.170" end="00:05:02.760" style="s2">because they can either start again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s unavailable right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.760" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">even that it&#39;s unobtainable so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:08.970" style="s2">problem of field updates cars are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:11.190" style="s2">actually updatable they just don&#39;t ship</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.970" end="00:05:14.340" style="s2">like they&#39;re afraid to do field updates</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.190" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">and they should be Toyota&#39;s calibration</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.340" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">update wizard if you unplug your thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:22.770" style="s2">halfway through it&#39;ll break your ECU</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:23.460" style="s2">like there&#39;s no the Honda one is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.770" end="00:05:25.890" style="s2">little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.460" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">well the Honda checksum is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.890" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">the Toyota the Toyota has a verify step</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:30.990" style="s2">which is a little bit better than a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.540" style="s2">check so you actually send all the data</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.990" end="00:05:36.330" style="s2">twice right you send it once for a flash</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.540" end="00:05:37.640" style="s2">and then once for verifying no this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.330" end="00:05:41.850" style="s2">not particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.640" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">it just reverts it&#39;s not the same no no</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.850" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t pervert it just says verify</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">failed and like you know you can try</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">flashing again they&#39;re kind of fucked</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:50.790" style="s2">right no but this isn&#39;t even good right</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:52.920" style="s2">because big flips are likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.790" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">correlated when you send bits down the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.920" end="00:05:57.030" style="s2">wire once right when you send them down</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">the same wire if some bits flipped</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.030" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a nonzero chance that the exact</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.160" end="00:06:03.540" style="s2">same bits gonna flip again yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">it&#39;s much better to do an integrity</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.540" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">check even something like a crc32 is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">better than this you know if you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.630" style="s2">that what are we uncorrelated on it&#39;s 4</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:16.050" style="s2">billion to 1 right and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.630" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">simple so the same corruption happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.050" end="00:06:21.890" style="s2">is probably higher than lower or like</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">the one yeah or you can just use a sha</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.890" end="00:06:26.370" style="s2">all right like it takes it took an</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:28.320" style="s2">incredible effort of like thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.370" end="00:06:29.910" style="s2">GPUs and some of Google&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.320" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">researchers to find a shot collision</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.910" end="00:06:34.040" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna you&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.270" style="s2">stumble upon a cut shot collision yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.040" end="00:06:38.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s just this is the way that like</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.270" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">Security&#39;s thought about and discussed</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.040" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">that&#39;s just absurd</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:45.030" style="s2">right like how can they improve how can</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:46.740" style="s2">they improve I mean none of us armed</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.030" end="00:06:48.120" style="s2">let&#39;s start with that they could take it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:50.780" style="s2">out signature checking but please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.120" end="00:06:50.780" style="s2">have a signature check</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:55.490" style="s2">please add an integrity check how could</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.020" end="00:06:58.250" style="s2">they improve this they could write a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.490" end="00:07:01.160" style="s2">function in the flasher that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.250" end="00:07:03.500" style="s2">compute a shot edge of the flash right</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.160" end="00:07:04.970" style="s2">and then you know you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.500" end="00:07:08.990" style="s2">without leaking any information you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:10.610" style="s2">you put in shot hash should be this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.990" end="00:07:12.680" style="s2">it computes the shot hash of the flash</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.610" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">but do they do many of these updates in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.680" end="00:07:16.940" style="s2">general or do they just usually just</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.380" style="s2">keep using the same well they don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.940" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">like that you know anyone who like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.380" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">understands what modern kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.020" style="s2">practices are for any kind of code</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:26.510" style="s2">development is you know you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.020" end="00:07:29.540" style="s2">to have rarely-used paths in your code</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.510" end="00:07:31.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to have this updater path</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.540" end="00:07:32.870" style="s2">that okay will use it like once a year</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.430" end="00:07:35.000" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.870" end="00:07:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know why not update much</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.000" end="00:07:37.910" style="s2">more frequently even if you&#39;re updating</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:40.550" style="s2">nothing right it&#39;s like making sure all</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.910" end="00:07:41.870" style="s2">your keys are rotated doing stuff maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.550" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a pro maybe they&#39;re in this like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.870" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">suboptimal there&#39;s local optima we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:49.730" style="s2">updating is just become so hard yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:52.040" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of like I don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.730" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">I think they have like completely</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.530" end="00:08:00.980" style="s2">literally right now if you want to if</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">you want to people talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.980" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">Toyota forms I&#39;ve been reading the forms</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:16.340" style="s2">lately like BMW mercedes-benz they might</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">be better I know a lot less about their</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.850" end="00:09:27.660" style="s2">sued for honestly I don&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.740" end="00:09:29.850" style="s2">actually a buck my understanding about</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.660" end="00:09:33.149" style="s2">the pedal sticking thing was literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.850" end="00:09:35.670" style="s2">like on two cars the mechanical pedal</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.149" end="00:09:38.519" style="s2">got stuck down and then you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.670" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">that&#39;s okay yeah someone like spills a</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:57.269" style="s2">unintended acceleration yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.850" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">what it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.269" end="00:10:06.750" style="s2">um do I think BMW Mercedes Toyota will</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.589" end="00:10:26.370" style="s2">die I think that they have roles in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.440" end="00:10:29.209" style="s2">in the future think about Toyota is they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.370" end="00:10:31.890" style="s2">do build a really nice cheap safe car</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.209" end="00:10:33.899" style="s2">Toyota should not be stupid and should</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.890" end="00:10:37.649" style="s2">you know it let somebody else build</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.899" end="00:10:38.820" style="s2">their build it I mean you and you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.649" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">the thing is you wouldn&#39;t actually give</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:50.449" style="s2">spend my whole time convincing people</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.890" end="00:10:50.449" style="s2">that like this yeah I&#39;m not doing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.610" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">what car companies are good Tesla to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:11:01.140" style="s2">honest it that&#39;s it yeah but that&#39;s part</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:05.550" style="s2">so these companies car companies don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.370" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.550" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">because nobody&#39;s gonna yeah yeah I mean</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:21.180" style="s2">Tesla yeah um Tesla has production</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.089" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">difficulties and Tesla also is never</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.079" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">right there I will see Tesla going back</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.779" style="s2">right sometime maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:36.120" style="s2">Tesla wants the Motul right yeah the</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.810" end="00:12:00.750" style="s2">sports car and it&#39;s very safe I do like</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.440" end="00:12:02.010" style="s2">that but that&#39;s not you know you look at</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:13.589" style="s2">integrate your tech into their car</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.209" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s all the source I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.589" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">love to see Toyota integrate it the</p>
