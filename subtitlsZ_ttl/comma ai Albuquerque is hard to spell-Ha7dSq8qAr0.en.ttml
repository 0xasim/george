<p begin="00:00:00.260" end="00:00:04.759" style="s2">we refine the most of the castle today</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.080" end="00:00:06.740" style="s2">that mustard castle they already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.759" end="00:00:08.029" style="s2">read like so driving level one features</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.740" end="00:00:09.379" style="s2">and so they can&#39;t be the other will use</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.029" end="00:00:13.219" style="s2">their art and for for having a better</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.379" end="00:00:14.870" style="s2">perception however we want we strongly</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.219" end="00:00:20.600" style="s2">believe in vision and we are moving away</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.870" end="00:00:22.760" style="s2">from using data at all the distance</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.600" end="00:00:24.890" style="s2">horizon for the radar how far out can</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.760" end="00:00:27.080" style="s2">the radar see right now well so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.890" end="00:00:29.540" style="s2">limitation that can be a specifically to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.080" end="00:00:30.740" style="s2">calculate the cap one of the twenty</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.540" end="00:00:32.900" style="s2">meters it&#39;s kind of like the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.740" end="00:00:34.490" style="s2">with if gain saves at 120 when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.900" end="00:00:38.180" style="s2">talking meter so it&#39;s like when I like</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.490" end="00:00:41.630" style="s2">35 yards it&#39;s like the video that those</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.180" end="00:00:45.620" style="s2">rather I can see but I mean like usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.630" end="00:00:47.780" style="s2">they go up to 150 160 180 but then like</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.620" end="00:00:50.060" style="s2">what use the purpose like sings so far</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.780" end="00:00:52.100" style="s2">right it becomes like even if you see a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.060" end="00:00:53.960" style="s2">car when it&#39;s like 180 meters away</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.100" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">becomes very hard to understand you see</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.960" end="00:00:57.890" style="s2">the cavities clips I&#39;m like in my lane</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">or it&#39;s not like when it wins like so</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.890" end="00:01:02.660" style="s2">far we know T if there is like a kukri</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">to all 180 meters away you won&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.660" end="00:01:07.819" style="s2">right the like you just care about</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.619" style="s2">understanding where we objects are and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.819" end="00:01:11.689" style="s2">out of their object that they should</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.619" end="00:01:13.450" style="s2">care about or not then when it gets so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.689" end="00:01:18.170" style="s2">far becomes like I don&#39;t like any port</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.450" end="00:01:21.350" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a curiosity some look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.170" end="00:01:24.380" style="s2">what&#39;s the support cars I see Chevy bolt</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.350" end="00:01:26.959" style="s2">and Prius which has you know has an</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.380" end="00:01:28.670" style="s2">electric or hybrid drivetrain just kinda</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.959" end="00:01:32.779" style="s2">curious is there any real difference</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.670" end="00:01:33.859" style="s2">between developing open pipe or car that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.779" end="00:01:36.490" style="s2">uses an internal combustion engine</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.859" end="00:01:36.490" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.640" end="00:01:42.110" style="s2">it&#39;s the same what&#39;s up it&#39;s pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.770" end="00:01:44.090" style="s2">the same like everything is the same I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.110" end="00:01:53.390" style="s2">just said like if we go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.090" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">slide about how a pilot works so pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.390" end="00:01:58.160" style="s2">much every Kenichi VC from half of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.720" style="s2">and Beyond is the same except like you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.160" end="00:02:03.530" style="s2">power it is that by effect are you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:05.750" style="s2">generate like the plane so if you can do</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.530" end="00:02:09.230" style="s2">this like imagine like well actually we</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.750" end="00:02:10.910" style="s2">do make like we might change the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.230" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2">that the for example you generate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.910" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">flaming if your characters along with</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.460" end="00:02:18.380" style="s2">the basics but like except your</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:19.940" style="s2">prerogative that define the size of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.380" end="00:02:22.280" style="s2">car everything that comes before</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">controls is up started from the specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.280" end="00:02:27.530" style="s2">car every things that come after</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">controls and have to do with interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.530" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">with your gamma can be scarce Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.860" style="s2">and generally like go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:35.270" style="s2">question how much does it change its</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.860" end="00:02:36.170" style="s2">combustion engine or like leather cap</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.270" end="00:02:39.560" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:41.630" style="s2">we found that casts that are hybrid are</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.560" end="00:02:44.270" style="s2">a little more pleasant to control</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.630" end="00:02:48.459" style="s2">because I feel it matters does it softer</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.270" end="00:02:48.459" style="s2">off like it is the combustion engines</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.030" end="00:03:05.880" style="s2">um so what the thing that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.240" end="00:03:07.740" style="s2">about is and this is you know me and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.880" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">my craziest and doesn&#39;t have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.740" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">a lot with the self-driving car part but</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:16.860" style="s2">with the the the the attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">measurement that you&#39;re doing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.860" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">looking at the person&#39;s face yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">question I have is what&#39;s your method</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.500" style="s2">right now doing that are you looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">you start training on a baseline of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.500" end="00:03:30.180" style="s2">know 80% of the time somebody&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">in this orientation and so they deviate</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.180" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">from that for a certain period of time</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">and you sort of have a waiting algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">and finally when it trips you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:39.860" style="s2">you&#39;re not paying attention because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">haven&#39;t been doing what you usually do</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.860" end="00:03:45.770" style="s2">well so it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">abstracted like usually we found that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.770" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">iterated on the algorithm and we found</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">that actually people that pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:57.380" style="s2">to their order they took straight your</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">hand is literally like kind of like like</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.380" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">thank you your eyes like your hand is</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">like perpendicular to today over them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">yeah and we found that to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:08.910" style="s2">like the massed usable and best</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">indicator that makes the intention and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">they makes it easy so what we do is like</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">we track like the angles like how your</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">head is oriented and then we have like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:19.169" style="s2">three shows over that depends like on</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">time for a longer you started and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.169" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">bad you like your to start out but</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">you&#39;re looking away and so we combine</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:26.310" style="s2">all those things and we have some sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:28.860" style="s2">of like lay shoulder to issue like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.310" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">war and it makes it easy because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.860" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">not for now it&#39;s not going to dependent</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">for example life I like I like where</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">you&#39;re looking because for example like</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">if you have a glasses sunglasses still</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:42.450" style="s2">works however we want to make it back</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">there and when possible start to track</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.450" end="00:04:48.009" style="s2">Isis where you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">this is the system are really not meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.009" end="00:04:52.419" style="s2">to be not suitable like if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:54.369" style="s2">see if you can the point of this system</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.419" end="00:04:55.959" style="s2">is that they should they should remind</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.369" end="00:04:59.589" style="s2">you how you should be you should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.959" end="00:05:00.759" style="s2">eight right and still it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.589" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">that it should be should it be better</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.759" end="00:05:04.389" style="s2">than what they are and so everyone like</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:06.519" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have sunglasses you should</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.389" end="00:05:08.679" style="s2">be able to try to track the ice movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.519" end="00:05:10.089" style="s2">where your eyes are looking at and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.679" end="00:05:12.419" style="s2">they are supposed to become better but</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.089" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">for now is like mainly like annotations</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.419" end="00:05:18.219" style="s2">how far from from the what you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">looking for a lot and is that all that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.219" end="00:05:23.050" style="s2">module is that abstracted away from all</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:25.869" style="s2">the rest of the open pilots stuff enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.050" end="00:05:27.580" style="s2">to where you know you could install that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.869" end="00:05:28.929" style="s2">in a in a vehicle just to get those</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:32.319" style="s2">alerts yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.929" end="00:05:34.209" style="s2">so okay okay to clarify this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.319" end="00:05:37.509" style="s2">good point I think you should topic type</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.209" end="00:05:39.219" style="s2">IDs so they they come here which is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.509" end="00:05:43.119" style="s2">the platform that we they are a platform</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.219" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">that we sell he by default doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.119" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that doesn&#39;t drive your</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:49.629" style="s2">cover it comes with the driver system</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.800" end="00:05:52.149" style="s2">feature this is called passive tiger</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.629" end="00:05:53.469" style="s2">system features so he warns you if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.149" end="00:05:55.419" style="s2">are about to collide with the cars it as</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.469" end="00:05:57.579" style="s2">for a collision warning and it has two</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:05:59.800" style="s2">other monitoring it s like speed sign</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.579" end="00:06:02.110" style="s2">recognitions things that we can just</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:05.559" style="s2">leverage without having to interact or</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.110" end="00:06:08.019" style="s2">like control your account in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.559" end="00:06:11.529" style="s2">that can become a development kit that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.019" end="00:06:12.879" style="s2">you can install any software it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.529" end="00:06:14.649" style="s2">but the pilot which is the use of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.879" end="00:06:16.839" style="s2">software they can actually like to IDF</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.649" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">can actually but bots software starts</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.839" end="00:06:21.279" style="s2">they are pretty much like very similar</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:23.559" style="s2">to each other like the software that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.279" end="00:06:24.849" style="s2">comes before with the system and open</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.559" end="00:06:27.669" style="s2">pilot they&#39;re very short each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.849" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">they&#39;re both open source and so yes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.669" end="00:06:30.879" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have like a sister that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:32.860" style="s2">you drive your car she just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.879" end="00:06:37.419" style="s2">futures care about like system it tracks</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.860" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">your intentions works as a dash cam so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.419" end="00:06:42.729" style="s2">of course your drive but what driving</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:46.559" style="s2">driver like the older and the internal</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.729" end="00:06:48.059" style="s2">of the car and so yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.559" end="00:06:49.769" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to use the specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.059" end="00:06:53.689" style="s2">driving feature if you just care about</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.769" end="00:06:55.859" style="s2">the Monaco features and are there any</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.689" end="00:06:57.989" style="s2">sensors that you&#39;re reading off of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.859" end="00:07:00.749" style="s2">canvas that you absolutely have to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.989" end="00:07:02.579" style="s2">there or there so you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.749" end="00:07:04.409" style="s2">have a complete separated from any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.579" end="00:07:05.339" style="s2">the electronics of the car is still</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.409" end="00:07:07.409" style="s2">getting some of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.339" end="00:07:09.539" style="s2">well yeah you should use TV and wiring</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.409" end="00:07:11.279" style="s2">at least yeah monitoring for sure on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.539" end="00:07:14.509" style="s2">speed sign of course because I can just</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.279" end="00:07:20.309" style="s2">rely on like GPS like we have like GPS</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.509" end="00:07:25.319" style="s2">like what open apps obvious like man he</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.309" end="00:07:27.809" style="s2">was obviously mad no it&#39;s like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.319" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">level level one like like here&#39;s step</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.809" end="00:07:31.559" style="s2">one is like you just you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:33.419" style="s2">hear like in your car and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.559" end="00:07:35.519" style="s2">connected to the can system of your of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.419" end="00:07:37.739" style="s2">the car and it just works as a dashcam I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.519" end="00:07:38.699" style="s2">still like dude a diaper monitoring if I</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.739" end="00:07:40.499" style="s2">were cuz your warning</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.699" end="00:07:42.119" style="s2">that&#39;s all worse that&#39;s that too is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.499" end="00:07:44.129" style="s2">but you have a supported car you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.119" end="00:07:46.259" style="s2">connected to can see TV you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.129" end="00:07:47.939" style="s2">advantage of the driving features but</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.259" end="00:07:50.069" style="s2">things are going to be better because</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.939" end="00:07:51.749" style="s2">you take care of like you know exerted</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.069" end="00:07:54.239" style="s2">by the speed of the carrier&#39;s etc then</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.749" end="00:07:55.649" style="s2">the next step after these it&#39;s like when</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.239" end="00:07:58.619" style="s2">you actually is lot of the pilot you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.649" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">have this is too much really okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.619" end="00:08:05.519" style="s2">so sort of like you can get like 25</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:07.709" style="s2">things from from the system was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.519" end="00:08:10.219" style="s2">sorry if I miss that you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.709" end="00:08:10.219" style="s2">say action</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.439" end="00:08:17.789" style="s2">so in some cities with poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:19.949" style="s2">infrastructure such as Albuquerque you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.789" end="00:08:24.149" style="s2">may have noticed some of the places you</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.949" end="00:08:26.550" style="s2">can barely see lane markings and street</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.149" end="00:08:29.009" style="s2">signs are missing or knocked over stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:30.779" style="s2">like that how well will the software</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.009" end="00:08:32.459" style="s2">Adela learn to adapt for things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.779" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">that are you just gonna have to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.459" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">over anytime that the city you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">driving and it has been infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">well so we do I know for example we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:45.420" style="s2">relying on the lane lines quite at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.459" style="s2">okay kind of the right without lane</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.420" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">lines but it doesn&#39;t work like a job</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.459" end="00:08:50.519" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s getting back there so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:53.069" style="s2">getting over the time is getting better</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.519" end="00:08:54.990" style="s2">it&#39;s getting like it is let you realize</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.069" end="00:08:56.339" style="s2">less and less on the actual feature like</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.990" end="00:08:57.779" style="s2">being pressed like pretty much like at</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.339" end="00:09:00.689" style="s2">you but that&#39;s a chemical driving if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.779" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">don&#39;t say yeah one of us are driving and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.689" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">there&#39;s no lines we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.930" style="s2">extrapolate from where everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:08.550" style="s2">yeah exactly so right now I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.930" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">like it kind of depends on like for</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.550" end="00:09:24.420" style="s2">example I clean lines safely but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:25.860" style="s2">know I came down route 66 there&#39;s a park</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.420" end="00:09:28.230" style="s2">that have no lines for probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.860" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">quarter-mile and identified the sand one</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.230" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">side of the right line just the color of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">the dirt out here Apple to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.650" end="00:09:47.450" style="s2">we were teaching the system to identify</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.420" end="00:09:50.870" style="s2">a license just abstract it from a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.450" end="00:09:53.530" style="s2">specific line line Caesar but the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.870" end="00:09:53.530" style="s2">release is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.090" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">and so-and-so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.150" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">what Soviet rip just cast away with</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:28.610" style="s2">Megaten</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:30.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s an ongoing process I believe</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.610" end="00:11:33.050" style="s2">that as of now we still have to do some</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.980" end="00:11:35.570" style="s2">more homework and like making the system</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.050" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">better but like in parallel yes we will</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.570" end="00:11:40.370" style="s2">be open to discuss we have done in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:41.029" style="s2">past we want to keep doing it but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.370" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">think they&#39;re usually two people</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.029" end="00:11:51.830" style="s2">homework it should be a good path yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:54.310" style="s2">University supported vehicles the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.830" end="00:11:56.570" style="s2">different different cars have different</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.310" end="00:11:58.220" style="s2">lower speed limits where they lose</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.570" end="00:12:00.500" style="s2">steering their acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.220" end="00:12:04.700" style="s2">functionality is a sense of limitation</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.500" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">or actuators and DC is that improving or</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.700" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">the cars getting better the figure is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:13.790" style="s2">getting better the point is that so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">certain cars like we have to make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.790" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">with the cats so we are like MSL</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:19.010" style="s2">everything is kind of abstracted from</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:21.380" style="s2">the car but then at certain point the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.010" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">last the end is like a dependent and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.380" end="00:12:25.460" style="s2">we have to obey to attack there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">their constraints of the specific car</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.460" end="00:12:30.140" style="s2">hands so if the specific cars locks you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:32.630" style="s2">are for controlling like the brake</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.140" end="00:12:34.940" style="s2">giving to steal for example below 10</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.630" end="00:12:38.630" style="s2">miles per hour then there&#39;s nothing we</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.940" end="00:12:40.790" style="s2">can do about that unless we last visited</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.630" end="00:12:44.060" style="s2">like change the former of your cameras</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.790" end="00:12:45.890" style="s2">which we don&#39;t want to do and instead</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.060" end="00:12:47.750" style="s2">like the point of an Impala should be</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.890" end="00:12:50.660" style="s2">really like creating something that ok</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.750" end="00:12:52.850" style="s2">has to deal with limitations that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.660" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">have a car specific at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.850" end="00:12:56.660" style="s2">important thing is that open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.190" style="s2">itself is capable of handling that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.660" end="00:13:00.770" style="s2">situation we care about vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.190" end="00:13:02.750" style="s2">pilots like a software that can is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.770" end="00:13:04.700" style="s2">actually up started and very general and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.750" end="00:13:05.370" style="s2">then of course like Africa is so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.700" end="00:13:07.020" style="s2">limitation</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.370" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">which is that we are forced to pay to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.020" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">them but the more we move forward the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:18.960" style="s2">lastest limitations are our present</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:20.670" style="s2">because cars that cheap now are less</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.960" end="00:13:22.920" style="s2">limited and Catholic worship like a year</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.670" end="00:13:24.630" style="s2">ago or two years ago like every car</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.920" end="00:13:26.370" style="s2">pretty much liked by the for tends to</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.630" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">add adaptive cruise control we stop and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.370" end="00:13:31.880" style="s2">go so it means that they can&#39;t braking</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:34.950" style="s2">and gas controllable from zero speed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.880" end="00:13:37.620" style="s2">whatever speed like 90 100 110 miles per</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.950" end="00:13:40.290" style="s2">hour so the directions get definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.620" end="00:13:41.580" style="s2">like more capable cars which we actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.290" end="00:13:51.750" style="s2">stop early align that with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.580" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">capability of the pie yes but as the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">data streaming app I can how</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:14:00.810" style="s2">standardized is that from one model to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">the next or sensor specific sensor to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.810" end="00:14:08.820" style="s2">the next so like if you&#39;re reading let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:10.950" style="s2">say speed data or for or radar how</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.820" end="00:14:14.520" style="s2">drastically different is it from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.950" end="00:14:18.030" style="s2">Toyota to a BMW or ever okay well so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.520" end="00:14:20.640" style="s2">among they they open source repositories</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.030" end="00:14:23.900" style="s2">between ever like when pilot is one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.640" end="00:14:26.430" style="s2">those repositories like software</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.900" end="00:14:28.260" style="s2">software market where you can find like</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.430" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">a complete complete like set of features</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.260" end="00:14:35.270" style="s2">we have we have another of the social</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">positive the disco like open D BC where</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.270" end="00:14:44.610" style="s2">so the DBC file is that the file that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:46.740" style="s2">describes your your can your CAD data</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.610" end="00:14:48.750" style="s2">this times are your candidate are like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.740" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">structure right and so this is like our</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">specific mainly car make and then within</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:58.110" style="s2">a car make almost every car are very</p>
