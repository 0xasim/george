<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">if we look at the US that sure looks</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.880" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">like an exponential curve to me can i</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:56.830" style="s2">zoom in on that you know we really try</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:04:00.970" style="s2">to stay away from news and we try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.830" end="00:04:11.800" style="s2">only focus on data I just downloaded I</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:20.610" style="s2">hospitalized the ICU it starts to matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.700" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">a lot more if you&#39;re if you&#39;re older</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.610" end="00:07:25.650" style="s2">they&#39;re a lot more likely to end up in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:34.530" style="s2">the ICU and you&#39;re a lot more likely to</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.630" style="s2">possible that China all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t report new cases let me show you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.630" end="00:08:20.310" style="s2">why China didn&#39;t report their cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:24.150" style="s2">here&#39;s my theory about that I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.439" end="00:10:43.049" style="s2">something good to grab for later you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.699" end="00:10:43.049" style="s2">never know when you&#39;re gonna need data</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.110" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">well you know more people have died in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.100" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">9/11 9/11 was was an attack on US soil</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:16.820" style="s2">though and I think that&#39;s why so little</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:16.820" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.710" end="00:11:32.260" style="s2">China was not behind the attack guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.380" end="00:11:41.720" style="s2">though I mean it&#39;s interesting thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.470" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">about China originally really downplayed</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.720" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">this and then they went they did like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:52.910" style="s2">complete 180 from downplaying it to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:54.170" style="s2">know those propaganda posters but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.910" end="00:11:56.300" style="s2">think this is what you get if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.170" end="00:11:58.839" style="s2">actually get a smart government that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">cares most of all about economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.839" end="00:12:04.580" style="s2">and this isn&#39;t necessarily the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.930" style="s2">choice you know people in America are</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.580" end="00:12:08.390" style="s2">always like but you got to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.930" end="00:12:10.850" style="s2">people&#39;s lives the economy be damned I</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.390" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">mean if we&#39;re using the excess economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.850" end="00:12:16.700" style="s2">growth for you know bullshit maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:18.830" style="s2">is true but the standard of living in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.700" end="00:12:21.050" style="s2">China has risen so rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.830" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">China has pulled more people out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.050" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">global poverty in the last 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:28.640" style="s2">through their economic growth than any</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:57.710" style="s2">best way to estimate this what for some</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.609" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">dirty I mean this is simple math now</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.910" end="00:41:47.000" style="s2">that&#39;s just let&#39;s just look at</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">percentages right so assume that like</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.000" end="00:41:51.859" style="s2">the cruise ship fully circulated the air</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:56.990" style="s2">and there were seven hundred eleven</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.859" end="00:42:05.240" style="s2">cases and I&#39;ve heard that half of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.990" end="00:42:10.070" style="s2">were asymptomatic twenty percent so</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.240" end="00:42:13.310" style="s2">about if we assume that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.070" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">testing people without symptoms then ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.310" end="00:42:19.820" style="s2">percent of people look like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">gonna get the disease assuming that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.820" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">stuff doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.490" end="00:42:37.910" style="s2">so 10% of America is 30 million okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.440" end="00:42:40.809" style="s2">well I don&#39;t take the noise tank on</p>

<p begin="01:46:59.620" end="01:47:01.780" style="s2">find the proper general discourse</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.490" end="01:47:03.220" style="s2">talking about how the phagocytes kind of</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.780" end="01:47:04.480" style="s2">story positive another thing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.220" end="01:47:06.340" style="s2">is in make the pathogens to stick</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.480" end="01:47:07.810" style="s2">together which again makes it easier for</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.340" end="01:47:09.610" style="s2">pathogens to find them and above them</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.810" end="01:47:11.080" style="s2">but also every letter from all about its</p>

<p begin="01:47:21.340" end="01:47:24.040" style="s2">makes only one type of antibody am i</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.840" end="01:47:25.150" style="s2">took like a why don&#39;t we want to find</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.040" end="01:47:26.140" style="s2">the probability of site they can produce</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.150" end="01:47:27.820" style="s2">the record bodies to destroy the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.140" end="01:47:29.290" style="s2">packaging and the consequences you might</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.820" end="01:47:30.220" style="s2">get sick in the meantime before you</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.290" end="01:47:31.870" style="s2">already actually find the correct</p>

<p begin="01:47:35.370" end="01:47:38.280" style="s2">one thing that happens is that memory</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.840" end="01:47:39.930" style="s2">cells of that leukocytes are produced</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.280" end="01:47:41.070" style="s2">after fighting the infection</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.930" end="01:47:42.300" style="s2">so the copies are the specific with</p>

<p begin="01:47:42.300" end="01:47:45.239" style="s2">ordinary cells and what that means is if</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.239" end="01:47:47.880" style="s2">get it it could immediately start</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.650" end="01:47:49.110" style="s2">producing the only bodies that it needs</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.880" end="01:47:50.580" style="s2">and then it can fight off the package</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.110" end="01:47:52.140" style="s2">and before that time to make you sick so</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.580" end="01:47:55.460" style="s2">it&#39;s an inequality at City not sympathy</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.140" end="01:47:57.150" style="s2">to the second time this is immunity</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.460" end="01:47:58.410" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the next type of white</p>

<p begin="01:47:58.410" end="01:48:01.320" style="s2">to live at a very great different method</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.580" end="01:48:03.030" style="s2">of destroying packages first of all the</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.320" end="01:48:04.350" style="s2">pathogen enters the body and then the</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.030" end="01:48:05.760" style="s2">fungicide recognizes it and starts to</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.350" end="01:48:07.710" style="s2">move toward it then the thing that comes</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.760" end="01:48:08.760" style="s2">is the phagocytes engulfs the pathogen</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.710" end="01:48:10.230" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to use the correct</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.760" end="01:48:13.950" style="s2">vocabulary here don&#39;t say that the</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.230" end="01:48:15.840" style="s2">phagocyte it&#39;s a very different review</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.950" end="01:48:17.400" style="s2">then what did inside of the front of</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.840" end="01:48:19.260" style="s2">site it gets destroyed using enzymes and</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.400" end="01:48:21.360" style="s2">finally the homeless broken-down product</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.260" end="01:48:22.920" style="s2">of the of the pathogen are inserted from</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.360" end="01:48:24.540" style="s2">the cell and then it&#39;s been destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.920" end="01:48:26.120" style="s2">the the positivity destroying the far</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.540" end="01:48:27.960" style="s2">side were born I didn&#39;t go for new cells</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.120" end="01:48:29.610" style="s2">so whatever comes we&#39;ll examine</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.960" end="01:48:30.510" style="s2">questions well one possible one is that</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.610" end="01:48:33.000" style="s2">he might give you this sort of picture</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.510" end="01:48:34.710" style="s2">truly good what might look like these</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.000" end="01:48:36.720" style="s2">are red blood cells these are</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.710" end="01:48:38.840" style="s2">lymphocytes and these are phagocytes</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.720" end="01:48:41.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t given food to attack each other so</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.840" end="01:48:43.320" style="s2">now this is a red blood cell and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.580" end="01:48:45.989" style="s2">used to carry oxygen throughout your</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.320" end="01:48:47.580" style="s2">body this is a lymphocyte and it makes</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.989" end="01:48:49.710" style="s2">antibodies but it only makes a specific</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.580" end="01:48:51.480" style="s2">antibody and antibodies can do a whole</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.710" end="01:48:53.670" style="s2">bunch of things it can get they needs to</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.480" end="01:48:55.710" style="s2">stick together and this is phagocytes</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.670" end="01:48:56.580" style="s2">don&#39;t say that they eat pathogens they</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.710" end="01:48:58.739" style="s2">engulf them</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.580" end="01:49:00.360" style="s2">oh you&#39;re responsible for transporting</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.739" end="01:49:01.560" style="s2">oxygen via the lymphocyte and this</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.360" end="01:49:03.780" style="s2">function is to produce antibodies to</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.560" end="01:49:05.130" style="s2">help destroy pathogens and C is called a</p>

<p begin="02:13:31.100" end="02:13:41.090" style="s2">I wrote a GPU hash cracker to crack</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.740" end="02:13:43.220" style="s2">these these Nokia hashes I missed a</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.090" end="02:13:44.930" style="s2">stupid RSA exploiting that one that came</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.220" end="02:13:46.310" style="s2">out a few months later and then the GPU</p>

<p begin="02:13:46.310" end="02:13:50.680" style="s2">those GPUs to my Bitcoin and buy drugs</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.030" end="02:14:01.339" style="s2">yeah so like not all the projects</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.739" end="02:14:02.989" style="s2">succeed</p>

<p begin="02:14:52.419" end="02:14:56.389" style="s2">didn&#39;t promote it to part-time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.649" end="02:14:59.329" style="s2">true but yeah so I have some time I</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.389" end="02:15:01.099" style="s2">don&#39;t know I I kind of like hanging out</p>

<p begin="02:15:11.719" end="02:15:13.929" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.030" end="02:15:20.269" style="s2">but I mean like also like you know where</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.860" end="02:15:22.519" style="s2">is this project going I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.269" end="02:15:25.760" style="s2">know where we&#39;re learning first that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.519" end="02:15:33.860" style="s2">the the first step to any to exploit in</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.760" end="02:15:36.349" style="s2">any system is don&#39;t I still do a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.860" end="02:15:42.679" style="s2">work at comma but you know it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.349" end="02:15:44.949" style="s2">it&#39;s not a full-time job anymore you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.679" end="02:15:48.469" style="s2">hiring too if any of you are interested</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.949" end="02:15:52.369" style="s2">no it&#39;s a cool place to work like I</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.469" end="02:15:53.869" style="s2">think that we&#39;re I think that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.369" end="02:16:01.820" style="s2">really gonna track to solving</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.869" end="02:16:08.300" style="s2">self-driving cars I don&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.820" end="02:16:09.530" style="s2">really feel that way last year but what</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.300" end="02:16:10.729" style="s2">am I trying to achieve well the first</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.530" end="02:16:12.860" style="s2">thing that you do whenever you&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.729" end="02:16:15.889" style="s2">to have a system is you have to learn</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.860" end="02:16:19.070" style="s2">everything about it when I did the ps3 I</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.889" end="02:16:23.420" style="s2">had a wiki that documented everything on</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.070" end="02:16:28.670" style="s2">the ps3 for the iPhone I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.420" end="02:16:30.380" style="s2">had a wiki yet I think I just like the</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.670" end="02:16:36.139" style="s2">cool thing about roars engineering this</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.380" end="02:16:37.700" style="s2">is like Wikipedia has when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:16:36.139" end="02:16:39.229" style="s2">looking up something specific from the</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.700" end="02:16:44.019" style="s2">iPhone for example it was a binary</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.229" end="02:16:46.760" style="s2">called BB updater and BB update or was</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.019" end="02:16:51.170" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that updated the baseband</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.760" end="02:16:53.630" style="s2">oh man you know I think back I think</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.170" end="02:16:57.170" style="s2">back in like how long would it take to</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.630" end="02:16:59.380" style="s2">do that iPhone unlock today no time at</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.170" end="02:16:59.380" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.020" end="02:17:16.700" style="s2">I worked in uh I was an intern at SpaceX</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.110" end="02:17:21.110" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.800" end="02:17:32.620" style="s2">people work very hard there if people</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.710" end="02:17:35.859" style="s2">are very motivated by the mission um oh</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.620" end="02:17:39.389" style="s2">just cuz of my skills about the iPhone I</p>

<p begin="02:21:09.670" end="02:21:17.800" style="s2">computer security look when I did it</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.670" end="02:21:29.570" style="s2">like 15 years ago it was cool like</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.800" end="02:21:32.990" style="s2">hacking was this like true do you like</p>

<p begin="02:22:29.689" end="02:22:33.880" style="s2">that&#39;s spider beard video is very cool</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.319" end="02:22:57.109" style="s2">build api&#39;s around Corona solutions</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.729" end="02:22:58.310" style="s2">there but I&#39;ll give it a try what I know</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.109" end="02:23:01.449" style="s2">a great API</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.310" end="02:23:01.449" style="s2">it&#39;s called CSV</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.400" end="02:23:17.800" style="s2">a poly a site after the coding sequence</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.860" end="02:23:22.970" style="s2">an origin of replication and an</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.080" end="02:23:26.021" style="s2">antibiotic resistance gene yeah there</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.970" end="02:23:29.090" style="s2">and there in plasmids</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.021" end="02:23:31.910" style="s2">it&#39;s cool how it works the spider beer</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.090" end="02:23:34.100" style="s2">video describes it basically you only</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.910" end="02:23:35.540" style="s2">some of your bacteria are gonna take up</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.100" end="02:23:37.340" style="s2">the plasmid right and then the bacteria</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.540" end="02:23:39.140" style="s2">replicating a replicate the plasmid</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.340" end="02:23:41.800" style="s2">hopefully - but you&#39;re left with you a</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.140" end="02:23:44.240" style="s2">really large percentage of bacteria that</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.800" end="02:23:45.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have the plasmid and how do you</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.240" end="02:23:47.000" style="s2">separate the ones that don&#39;t from the</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.440" end="02:23:48.470" style="s2">ones that do well your plasmid includes</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.000" end="02:23:50.060" style="s2">an antibiotic resistance gene you put</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.470" end="02:23:53.740" style="s2">that antibiotic in the solution and then</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.060" end="02:23:53.740" style="s2">you&#39;re left with only the bacteria</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.350" end="02:24:05.870" style="s2">despite protein sequence will need to be</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.690" end="02:24:10.780" style="s2">synthesized by a third party so the</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.870" end="02:24:15.110" style="s2">spike protein is this many amino acids</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.780" end="02:24:23.810" style="s2">maybe cobble together can you synthesize</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.110" end="02:24:27.760" style="s2">a whole plasmid thank you fine if I go</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.810" end="02:24:27.760" style="s2">to one of these gene synthesis services</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.820" end="02:24:42.740" style="s2">how does it does the DNA just come in a</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.521" end="02:24:47.450" style="s2">vial oh they do cloning did they put it</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.740" end="02:24:55.930" style="s2">in a I mean there should be a service</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.450" end="02:25:01.390" style="s2">actually that can give me will be</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.930" end="02:25:06.920" style="s2">delivered dry in a circular eyes plasmid</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.390" end="02:25:10.970" style="s2">five thousand base pairs all right so I</p>

<p begin="02:41:14.500" end="02:41:23.021" style="s2">if it does go below 95 you need oxygen</p>
<p begin="02:41:17.790" end="02:41:25.990" style="s2">and then if the oxygen stops working you</p>
<p begin="02:41:23.021" end="02:41:28.061" style="s2">need a ventilator I&#39;m not gonna go so</p>
