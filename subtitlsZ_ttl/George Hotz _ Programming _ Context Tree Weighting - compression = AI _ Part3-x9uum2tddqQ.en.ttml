<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">I was trying to encode infinite</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.980" end="00:01:01.430" style="s2">precision but you don&#39;t you need</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:04.610" style="s2">infinite precision like it&#39;s fine just</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.430" end="00:01:06.229" style="s2">represent it as 32 bits key inside the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.610" end="00:01:11.720" style="s2">precision doesn&#39;t have to be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.229" end="00:01:12.950" style="s2">just the same on encode and decode um so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.720" end="00:01:14.830" style="s2">it&#39;s still saying we have zero viewers</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.950" end="00:01:19.660" style="s2">let&#39;s give people a little bit of time</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.170" end="00:02:05.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s a little bit hard to do coding</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.400" end="00:02:13.430" style="s2">because guys I&#39;ve fallen on rough times</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:11.389" style="s2">questions about integrals I promise you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.900" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">I haven&#39;t learned this stuff recently we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.389" end="00:05:18.470" style="s2">can do this I got a five on BC calc AP</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:19.849" style="s2">exam when I was when I was fifteen and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.470" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">don&#39;t really forget much of that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.849" end="00:05:23.780" style="s2">it was pretty new shit I remember how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:26.030" style="s2">press the integral symbol of my ti 89 so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.780" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">yes I know what an integral is and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.030" end="00:05:28.789" style="s2">you guys can ask me questions about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">and then I want everybody to go on</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.789" end="00:05:34.760" style="s2">YouTube and download that comment B this</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:38.270" style="s2">is bullshit man are you guys gonna stand</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.760" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">for that big news first you can ask me</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.270" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">first you can you can you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:44.870" style="s2">ask me questions right here and chat</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">about about integrals and in like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.870" end="00:05:48.139" style="s2">know here&#39;s here&#39;s here&#39;s here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">interview here&#39;s my interview I let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.139" end="00:05:53.210" style="s2">wants to ask me integral questions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:55.300" style="s2">give me like hard bullshit like if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.210" end="00:05:58.120" style="s2">ask me what the integral of like sine is</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.300" end="00:06:03.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like negative cosine or something</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.120" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">but is it negative cosine well so an</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.020" end="00:06:08.650" style="s2">integral is an area under the curve so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.020" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">if you think about the integral of sine</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.650" end="00:06:13.849" style="s2">here&#39;s sine well you really have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">about how you wanna how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.849" end="00:06:18.650" style="s2">define that integral but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.000" end="00:06:20.449" style="s2">probably want it to be your negative</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.650" end="00:06:22.729" style="s2">cosine because you wanted to start from</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.449" end="00:06:23.630" style="s2">here at minus one so yes the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.729" end="00:06:26.480" style="s2">integral of sine</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.630" end="00:06:28.550" style="s2">cosine what&#39;s the integral of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.480" end="00:06:31.610" style="s2">exponential an integral of like two to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.550" end="00:06:32.990" style="s2">the X well so the integral of e to the X</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.610" end="00:06:34.850" style="s2">is of course the same as the derivative</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:36.500" style="s2">of e to the X which is e to the X I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.850" end="00:06:39.530" style="s2">love you to the X for that so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.500" end="00:06:40.850" style="s2">what you mean by an exponential if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.530" end="00:06:44.360" style="s2">ask me what the I don&#39;t know if 2 to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.850" end="00:06:47.030" style="s2">X was I don&#39;t know maybe I should know</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.360" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">that what&#39;s the integral of 1 the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:53.330" style="s2">integral of 1 is X plus C of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:55.960" style="s2">don&#39;t forget your plus C&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.330" end="00:06:58.340" style="s2">that&#39;s right right the integral of 1 is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.960" end="00:07:00.980" style="s2">well yeah so the integral case so if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:07:04.700" style="s2">think about the line y equals 1 the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.980" end="00:07:06.890" style="s2">integral is going to be X oh yes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.700" end="00:07:08.570" style="s2">integral of the tangent of sine alright</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.890" end="00:07:13.820" style="s2">so I think for that we have to use the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.570" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">chain rule so yeah ok yeah that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.820" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond what I can do what I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:20.150" style="s2">do in my head III don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">alabaster integral or judicial a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.150" end="00:07:24.860" style="s2">function is though I have heard that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:27.410" style="s2">name before the up votes are going up</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.860" end="00:07:28.790" style="s2">fuck you guys you know you know I hate</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.410" end="00:07:31.160" style="s2">that fake news man</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.490" end="00:07:39.830" style="s2">convinced that the derivative of cosine</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.430" end="00:07:41.480" style="s2">is minus sine so yeah that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.830" end="00:07:43.490" style="s2">what I said you can take the - you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.480" end="00:07:47.990" style="s2">take the minus sign outside and integral</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.490" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">the integral of the derivative of sine</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.990" end="00:07:53.390" style="s2">would be cosine if you think like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:56.090" style="s2">slope of sine here is going to be 1 you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.390" end="00:07:59.050" style="s2">can convert the tan to sine cosine and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.090" end="00:08:04.130" style="s2">then do it tangent is sine over cosine</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.050" end="00:08:06.530" style="s2">hey guys don&#39;t spring fake news if</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.130" end="00:08:08.450" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be fake news we can&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.180" end="00:08:22.590" style="s2">aircon room tonight yeah all right all</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.220" end="00:08:24.450" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.590" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">well you know that&#39;s the thing you ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.450" end="00:08:28.230" style="s2">people on the Internet to do something</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:29.820" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna get that done this</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.230" end="00:08:32.340" style="s2">you like you gotta you gotta ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.820" end="00:08:33.990" style="s2">yourself difficult questions the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.340" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">integral of e to the X is e to the X</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.990" end="00:08:40.050" style="s2">plus C plus C for that wonder then okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:42.659" style="s2">so you can also have you can also have</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.050" end="00:08:44.550" style="s2">to have definite integrals where a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.659" end="00:08:46.470" style="s2">definite integral is when you have like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.550" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">here&#39;s your like weird integral e thingy</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:50.490" style="s2">and then there&#39;s like that guy and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">guy and you compute the integral with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.490" end="00:08:53.580" style="s2">that and then do minus the integral of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:54.120" style="s2">that and then you don&#39;t need a plus C</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.580" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.120" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">if you sedan didn&#39;t go but if C</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:08:59.490" style="s2">indefinite integral you have to put the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">plus C or you get little minus ones on</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.490" end="00:09:11.070" style="s2">your math test now guys I have them</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:18.180" style="s2">let&#39;s count my money one ringgit doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.070" end="00:09:20.100" style="s2">it mmm seven ringgit 57 ringgit and i do</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:28.950" style="s2">Harry Island tomorrow like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.030" end="00:09:32.220" style="s2">ask yourself tough questions do I drink</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.950" end="00:09:34.650" style="s2">the tap water or do we pay to ring it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.220" end="00:09:37.560" style="s2">for ice mountain it&#39;s cause to wring it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.650" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">guys what do you do for money I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.560" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">cowboy</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.570" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">you can tailor expand oh I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.030" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">and well I should begley know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:52.200" style="s2">that you don&#39;t think I really know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:54.510" style="s2">Taylor expansions is like that so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">can compute like there&#39;s a couple to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.510" end="00:09:59.790" style="s2">compute you can compute sine X that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:01.080" style="s2">and then that so you can get like PI if</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.790" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">you want if you want to do PI there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.080" end="00:10:05.400" style="s2">couple Taylor expansions I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:08.130" style="s2">the Taylor expansion of e to the X as</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:09.720" style="s2">well I know the edx thing has like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.130" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">factorials or something thank you for</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.150" end="00:10:53.150" style="s2">because yap yap yap yap yap yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:58.340" style="s2">well dude we don&#39;t talk about kama on</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.150" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">this stream i remember the basics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.340" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">calc nope like my point that I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:04.460" style="s2">trying to get it you know what let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.020" style="s2">revisit that integral since we&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.460" end="00:11:16.490" style="s2">a lot of time on the integral incident</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.020" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">now um I believe it was used year this</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.490" end="00:11:23.090" style="s2">is probably gonna be the last here we go</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">okay the KT probability of a binary data</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.090" end="00:11:33.980" style="s2">sequence is defined as this now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:41.450" style="s2">the integral of this I don&#39;t know I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.980" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">the A&#39;s and the B&#39;s are constant I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.450" end="00:11:49.490" style="s2">know what W is a W is this so I plug</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:52.460" style="s2">this in so now I have like weird PI&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.490" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">my integral they write all of this out</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.460" end="00:11:57.410" style="s2">and then they just say well here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:12:00.730" style="s2">equation for it right like my point is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.410" end="00:12:04.280" style="s2">we could have avoided and in to go there</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:06.290" style="s2">this sound and the guys I&#39;m amazed that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.280" end="00:12:08.660" style="s2">the internet works here at all I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.290" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">link Aoi Island if you if you&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">fuck you YouTube commenters I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">what the integral is but we&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">any well we&#39;ll do more math questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:21.470" style="s2">you know I always like math questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.960" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s good a judge you memory keeps</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.559" end="00:30:54.090" style="s2">so I think the problem was just that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.150" end="00:30:55.620" style="s2">wasn&#39;t creating those notes don&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.620" end="00:31:03.050" style="s2">I create those notes no maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:08.790" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t do better take that one back</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.050" end="00:31:12.660" style="s2">but yeah the promise is no way to really</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.790" end="00:31:16.200" style="s2">on create the notes so when I call</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.660" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">reverse it doesn&#39;t remove the node can I</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.200" end="00:31:20.940" style="s2">make it remove the note not really known</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:22.830" style="s2">as it&#39;s done and find so you okay it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:48:04.780" style="s2">watching an ad thank you um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.910" end="00:48:10.790" style="s2">unfortunately this one doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.780" end="00:48:12.350" style="s2">multiple stuff and the other one uses</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.790" end="00:48:23.810" style="s2">some other crazy stuff that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.350" end="00:48:24.950" style="s2">understand tutorials that&#39;s that I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.810" end="00:48:26.750" style="s2">I wrote a little I wrote a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.950" end="00:48:31.880" style="s2">compressor that uses the CTS</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.750" end="00:48:34.340" style="s2">implementation just to test the to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.880" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">the number of bits and yeah so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.340" end="00:48:38.980" style="s2">to encode it in under three dozen bytes</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:41.210" style="s2">so this is the best one</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.980" end="00:48:44.360" style="s2">now Malaysia&#39;s are super safe country</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.210" end="00:48:46.550" style="s2">guys so well it&#39;s really it&#39;s a really a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.360" end="00:48:51.020" style="s2">good story</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.550" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">yes I wrote this just a little thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.020" end="00:48:57.080" style="s2">that uses this thingy which is allegedly</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:49:00.410" style="s2">good but maybe you wait this gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.080" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2">sense oh that gives me the log</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.410" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2">probability of C okay I understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.660" end="00:49:14.610" style="s2">yeah so I can again iterate over all</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.950" end="00:49:14.610" style="s2">them to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:28.050" style="s2">well what&#39;s in the docks on the docks</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.570" end="00:49:28.050" style="s2">any good</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">whether I like these people they include</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.210" end="00:50:01.450" style="s2">their reference Python implementation</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:02.470" style="s2">because no one implement stuff and see</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.450" end="00:50:05.020" style="s2">on the first try</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.470" end="00:50:07.560" style="s2">why do that makes it work in Python</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.020" end="00:50:07.560" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.930" end="00:50:20.170" style="s2">all my boat buying plans I forgot all</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.010" end="00:50:20.170" style="s2">about that forgot all about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.850" end="00:50:31.180" style="s2">all right I think there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.220" end="00:50:36.120" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have to learn about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.180" end="00:50:36.120" style="s2">version works with large alphabets</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.580" end="00:51:15.980" style="s2">so probably what they&#39;re doing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.750" end="00:51:17.570" style="s2">yeah it does look like they&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.980" end="00:51:20.600" style="s2">kt estimate all right like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.570" end="00:51:23.780" style="s2">talk about it anywhere I just use Bayes</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.600" end="00:51:25.130" style="s2">rule here I mean if I have a prior I</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.780" end="00:51:29.090" style="s2">think the only question is like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.130" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">my prior right so this this this update</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.090" end="00:51:34.130" style="s2">can be replaced by Bayes rule</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:37.940" style="s2">I think that&#39;s effectively kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.130" end="00:51:41.230" style="s2">it is right cuz I&#39;m subtracting over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.940" end="00:51:41.230" style="s2">sum of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.430" end="00:51:49.540" style="s2">we don&#39;t talk about the past even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.410" end="00:51:52.170" style="s2">you&#39;re a subscriber we only talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.540" end="00:51:52.170" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.269" end="00:52:35.369" style="s2">okay so instead of using a KT estimator</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.449" end="00:52:35.369" style="s2">it&#39;s using a derisively estimator</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.900" end="00:53:04.339" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a multivariate generalization</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.390" end="00:53:06.289" style="s2">of the beta distribution so the beta</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.339" end="00:53:08.769" style="s2">distribution is what&#39;s discussed in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.289" end="00:53:08.769" style="s2">other paper</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.140" end="00:53:17.150" style="s2">this talks about the beta distribution</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.230" end="00:53:22.690" style="s2">we should understand what the beta</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.820" end="00:53:22.690" style="s2">distribution is</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.520" end="00:53:42.270" style="s2">yeah you know what you guys want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.350" end="00:53:43.650" style="s2">cheat you guys want to use you want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.270" end="00:53:49.310" style="s2">use there&#39;s let&#39;s see if we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.650" end="00:53:49.310" style="s2">make it a compressor let&#39;s do that first</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.269" end="00:54:32.950" style="s2">make sure the lightness is something</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.410" end="00:54:32.950" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.670" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">okay so this actually still doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.290" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">this problem trivial even though we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">cheating No</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.409" end="00:55:48.259" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give it the same interface as</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.819" end="00:55:55.009" style="s2">the other one the other one is it pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.259" end="00:55:58.719" style="s2">good interface I think model of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.009" end="00:55:58.719" style="s2">contextual sequence wall</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.900" end="00:57:16.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s the interface log prob</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.230" end="00:57:52.290" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get the number of those for</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.870" end="00:57:52.290" style="s2">this thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.140" end="00:58:04.390" style="s2">Oh see look yeah look they do the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.809" end="00:58:12.670" style="s2">thing have a special symbol call it</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.390" end="00:58:15.190" style="s2">starts in them it starts them so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.670" end="00:58:22.930" style="s2">actually doing the same trick as I am</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.190" end="00:58:26.579" style="s2">here instead of so they&#39;re just called</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.930" end="00:58:26.579" style="s2">soft up free bags that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.950" end="00:58:55.210" style="s2">called context Lance</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.480" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">number of bits like a moron um so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.359" end="00:59:07.509" style="s2">can think of this as cheating a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:09.339" style="s2">bit you can think of it kinda like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.509" end="00:59:10.599" style="s2">i&#39;m reading i&#39;m using this</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.339" end="00:59:12.009" style="s2">implementation but this is actually how</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.599" end="00:59:15.509" style="s2">you learn things like try to do things</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.009" end="00:59:19.960" style="s2">for yourself struggle to an extent and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.509" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">then really kind of mesh the two</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.960" end="00:59:23.559" style="s2">implementations together it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.039" style="s2">the most efficient way I&#39;ve really found</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.559" end="00:59:26.039" style="s2">to learn</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.109" end="00:59:50.349" style="s2">so if they call Preet with would they</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.349" style="s2">call context I call pre-tax</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.260" end="01:00:44.680" style="s2">here we want to say cgw okay I&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.730" end="01:00:47.790" style="s2">sure my shit still works self dot</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.680" end="01:00:47.790" style="s2">context Lane</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.060" end="01:01:00.260" style="s2">I&#39;ll spell it right just index out of</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.350" end="01:01:04.160" style="s2">rain</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.260" end="01:01:04.160" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s amazing fighter</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.020" end="01:01:38.030" style="s2">so that really shouldn&#39;t be global</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.910" end="01:01:50.100" style="s2">mmm if you subscribe no I mean I use the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.390" end="01:01:52.140" style="s2">top right as well it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.100" end="01:01:55.550" style="s2">hard I know you miss a little bit you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.140" end="01:01:55.550" style="s2">miss a little bit what&#39;s down here</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.590" end="01:02:04.930" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hard there kind of breaks</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.970" end="01:02:04.930" style="s2">the abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.460" end="01:02:21.589" style="s2">it&#39;s hacky is still gonna use a ball</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.050" end="01:02:21.589" style="s2">ball but</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.250" end="01:02:44.970" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.460" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">so I mean it&#39;s got a shitty compression</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.590" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">ratio but I think it still works</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.660" end="01:03:04.120" style="s2">he wrote a test very high quality test</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.980" end="01:03:19.430" style="s2">okay let&#39;s plug in their model because</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.750" end="01:03:21.860" style="s2">they actually understand what a DeRusha</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.430" end="01:03:23.210" style="s2">lay estimator and sampler is and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.860" end="01:03:24.650" style="s2">and one day we&#39;re gonna understand this</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.210" end="01:03:26.800" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s less fun to do one two</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.650" end="01:03:26.800" style="s2">edge</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.000" end="01:03:37.780" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:41.050" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.549" end="01:03:45.549" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.110" end="01:03:52.600" style="s2">from cts important</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.620" end="01:03:58.800" style="s2">and then we will just say cg w equals</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.920" end="01:04:06.750" style="s2">all about contextual sequence no okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.299" end="01:04:13.709" style="s2">so is it called update called up there</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.239" end="01:04:19.779" style="s2">where you switch that to bite chance</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.259" end="01:04:21.989" style="s2">that this is still wrong let&#39;s see if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.779" end="01:04:21.989" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.080" end="01:04:29.830" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.680" end="01:04:37.610" style="s2">I was logged problem so in order to</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.100" end="01:04:49.120" style="s2">convert a log prob to a real probability</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.610" end="01:04:49.120" style="s2">we have to do a map back course</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.630" end="01:04:56.869" style="s2">and also probably doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.099" end="01:04:56.869" style="s2">attribute notes does it</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.040" end="01:05:06.510" style="s2">and we have notes</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.070" end="01:06:08.760" style="s2">well look one byte of entropy how did we</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.150" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.760" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">okay okay okay we&#39;ll move the camera</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.090" end="01:06:35.900" style="s2">but no complaining if it&#39;s up here all</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.790" end="01:06:35.900" style="s2">right a little bit wrong</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.810" end="01:07:23.830" style="s2">hmm so it&#39;s very slow now see how slow</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.320" end="01:07:26.370" style="s2">it is so slow so small oh it takes so</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.830" end="01:07:26.370" style="s2">much bites</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.050" end="01:07:41.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not exactly right it really just</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.230" end="01:07:45.610" style="s2">one count yeah yeah every night you do</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.080" end="01:07:50.800" style="s2">count times eight so it&#39;s number of bits</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.610" end="01:07:53.070" style="s2">to encode the bytes is actually correct</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.800" end="01:07:53.070" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:04.190" style="s2">thank you thank you for the bet thank</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.950" end="01:08:04.190" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.869" end="01:08:26.980" style="s2">okay so now we&#39;re doing things at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.609" end="01:08:29.489" style="s2">fight level we&#39;re gonna see if we get</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.980" end="01:08:29.489" style="s2">better compression</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.030" end="01:08:39.860" style="s2">insanely slow</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.909" end="01:08:54.679" style="s2">and what it does compress better</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.089" end="01:09:00.409" style="s2">because ratios</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.729" end="01:09:16.619" style="s2">yeah such good ratios</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.819" end="01:09:24.509" style="s2">you know what I believe a bit is 10</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.920" end="01:09:24.509" style="s2">cents large I&#39;m probably wrong</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.890" end="01:23:53.030" style="s2">it might also have to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.230" end="01:23:53.030" style="s2">that I generate all the all the things</p>

<p begin="01:24:27.139" end="01:24:34.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know why all these people hype it</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.270" end="01:24:37.190" style="s2">out through all these papers hyping up</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.010" end="01:24:42.219" style="s2">this stupid algorithm and then like you</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.190" end="01:24:46.909" style="s2">write it I&#39;m like this is not that good</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.219" end="01:24:51.829" style="s2">no the only proof I have that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.909" end="01:24:55.849" style="s2">all terrible is there is the CGW</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.829" end="01:24:58.159" style="s2">baseline and they did better than they</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.849" end="01:24:59.840" style="s2">do better than Jesus this code is</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.159" end="01:25:02.659" style="s2">actually a compressor that does better</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.840" end="01:25:07.460" style="s2">than Jesus that skips egw to skip CTX</p>

<p begin="01:25:07.460" end="01:25:16.639" style="s2">there&#39;s people here listen to people -</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.980" end="01:25:18.440" style="s2">yeah the skips easiest thing I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.639" end="01:25:22.840" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t seem better when I generate</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.440" end="01:25:26.079" style="s2">all the probabilities of all the symbols</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.840" end="01:25:28.369" style="s2">so it was it was sneaking information it</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.079" end="01:25:30.670" style="s2">right like once I actually compute all</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.369" end="01:25:30.670" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.860" end="01:25:41.140" style="s2">the ratio seems garbage this isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:25:41.140" end="01:25:45.580" style="s2">well that doesn&#39;t really work see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.960" end="01:25:49.150" style="s2">the thing unless you actually have</p>

<p begin="01:29:30.710" end="01:29:34.929" style="s2">my compressors as good as theirs almost</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.540" end="01:29:43.760" style="s2">there is go-go bar when we go to go</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.940" end="01:29:43.760" style="s2">check my Oh symbol that&#39;s before</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.440" end="01:29:55.330" style="s2">I say</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.379" end="01:30:32.169" style="s2">okay it gets about 50% compression</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.050" end="01:30:34.449" style="s2">ratios and takes a long-ass time um in</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.169" end="01:30:39.879" style="s2">the future anybody who talks about the</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.449" end="01:30:40.869" style="s2">ps3 is banned the ps3 is a bad topic or</p>

<p begin="01:31:10.130" end="01:31:12.910" style="s2">actually anymore</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.560" end="01:31:29.090" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a working compressor but I</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.990" end="01:31:31.720" style="s2">think we are all disappointed with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.090" end="01:31:31.720" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.290" end="01:31:55.290" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.530" end="01:32:00.059" style="s2">and you guys can confirm that you can</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.479" end="01:32:05.070" style="s2">defend week four and and look for Dec</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.059" end="01:32:07.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re the same but the ratio is</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.070" end="01:32:11.729" style="s2">kind of shitty because the model is not</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.320" end="01:32:17.429" style="s2">that good even their model was still</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.729" end="01:32:20.519" style="s2">getting doing worse than gzip the only</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.429" end="01:32:22.769" style="s2">one I&#39;ve seen this better is this cgw</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.519" end="01:32:27.260" style="s2">baseline which is written by the authors</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.769" end="01:32:27.260" style="s2">of the paper by</p>

<p begin="01:32:31.860" end="01:32:36.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what people think when they made</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.150" end="01:32:43.230" style="s2">me talk we&#39;r disappoints weird</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.840" end="01:32:45.120" style="s2">disappoints um you know you guys if the</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.230" end="01:32:49.400" style="s2">compressor was good it was a good</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.120" end="01:32:49.400" style="s2">compressor I was gonna write it and rust</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.969" end="01:33:07.190" style="s2">thank you graduation Reagan Reagan oh</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.500" end="01:33:11.410" style="s2">thank you for subscribing so I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.190" end="01:33:14.180" style="s2">that kind of wraps up which CDW unless</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.410" end="01:33:17.449" style="s2">we get a lot better unless we figure out</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.180" end="01:33:19.580" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing something wrong if</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.449" end="01:33:21.920" style="s2">somebody out there can find a better</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.580" end="01:33:26.980" style="s2">implementation of this stuff that does</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.920" end="01:33:29.300" style="s2">like better than mine I&#39;d be impressed I</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.980" end="01:33:30.680" style="s2">mean I&#39;m sure there&#39;s like subtle ways</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.300" end="01:33:32.060" style="s2">it can do better but there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.680" end="01:33:34.699" style="s2">bug in mine too there&#39;s a little bug</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.060" end="01:33:35.890" style="s2">where it doesn&#39;t uncreate the node if it</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.699" end="01:33:38.330" style="s2">creates the nodes</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.890" end="01:33:45.730" style="s2">ya know wouldn&#39;t you like to see me code</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.330" end="01:33:45.730" style="s2">and rust sometimes sometimes it lazy yes</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.570" end="01:33:55.489" style="s2">what about basic probabilities</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.880" end="01:34:05.300" style="s2">completely theory it&#39;s got like only a</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.800" end="01:34:07.960" style="s2">few axioms I think then calm our graph</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.300" end="01:34:07.960" style="s2">is actually the one who</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.539" end="01:34:29.139" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.219" end="01:34:35.440" style="s2">No also if you haven&#39;t checked it out</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.550" end="01:34:37.840" style="s2">definitely check out quantum computing</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.440" end="01:34:42.639" style="s2">since Democritus it goes into how</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.840" end="01:34:44.979" style="s2">quantum stuff is just l to quantum</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.639" end="01:34:49.420" style="s2">probabilities amplitudes of the l2 norm</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.979" end="01:34:51.249" style="s2">of probability it&#39;s pretty cool yeah if</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.420" end="01:34:53.139" style="s2">you want to do that I don&#39;t know it just</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.249" end="01:34:55.809" style="s2">seemed boring and a lot like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.139" end="01:34:59.289" style="s2">tedious work and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.809" end="01:35:00.940" style="s2">gonna learn anything doing it I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.289" end="01:35:04.989" style="s2">sure I learned stuff but it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.940" end="01:35:07.329" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in anymore I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.989" end="01:35:08.800" style="s2">a lot more math stuff lately which is</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.329" end="01:35:17.619" style="s2">why I was particularly offended by the</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.800" end="01:35:19.979" style="s2">integral thing I read this book it was</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.619" end="01:35:19.979" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.320" end="01:35:28.820" style="s2">the first the first one was pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.389" end="01:35:28.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like three lectures by mr. Chayton</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.090" end="01:35:33.289" style="s2">guy shape this constant</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.909" end="01:35:39.710" style="s2">I&#39;ll get a lot of people on tonight&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.469" end="01:35:42.070" style="s2">stream yeah sorry twitch CW didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.710" end="01:35:42.070" style="s2">that well</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.760" end="01:35:48.469" style="s2">let&#39;s add an old mountain to read me</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.840" end="01:35:57.430" style="s2">it is a working</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.719" end="01:36:42.780" style="s2">no I&#39;ll say maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.630" end="01:37:10.260" style="s2">no I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t recommend shit</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.980" end="01:37:15.690" style="s2">for people man do whatever seems fun you</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.260" end="01:37:17.820" style="s2">know wine carry hey well so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.690" end="01:37:20.520" style="s2">gonna say this tool mildly but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.820" end="01:37:27.600" style="s2">come to langkawi okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.520" end="01:37:34.140" style="s2">I would avoid langkawi but Thailand lies</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.600" end="01:37:38.810" style="s2">ahead let&#39;s take a look at the map here</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.140" end="01:37:42.300" style="s2">I am in link Aoi on sinning Beach</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.810" end="01:37:47.940" style="s2">tomorrow we take an overpriced taxi to</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.300" end="01:37:54.830" style="s2">kueh and then we take it over priced</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.940" end="01:37:54.830" style="s2">ferry to probably koala Perlis</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.050" end="01:38:06.880" style="s2">and then we get on a train and we go to</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.020" end="01:38:08.320" style="s2">Thailand will decide halfway through</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.880" end="01:38:10.450" style="s2">whether we want to stop should we stop</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.320" end="01:38:14.500" style="s2">at the coast I worry that the cozaar</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.450" end="01:38:19.080" style="s2">gonna be just like link Aoi but talk in</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.500" end="01:38:19.080" style="s2">which case we can skip the coast</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.100" end="01:38:23.820" style="s2">definitely skip Phuket</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.280" end="01:38:29.630" style="s2">Sarat to me I just read the beach that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.190" end="01:38:38.030" style="s2">what I did for the last two days I read</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.630" end="01:38:42.260" style="s2">the beach not that not that not the</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.030" end="01:38:44.420" style="s2">movie it&#39;s a pretty good book and I kind</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.260" end="01:38:46.670" style="s2">of enjoyed it it&#39;s trash it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.420" end="01:38:55.010" style="s2">like easy to read trash but no this is</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.670" end="01:38:56.870" style="s2">enjoyable Bangkok yeah and I think this</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.010" end="01:38:59.570" style="s2">might be this might be it first dreams</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.870" end="01:39:02.270" style="s2">for a bet unless I have something new</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.570" end="01:39:04.280" style="s2">and good there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll do one</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.270" end="01:39:09.410" style="s2">more cgw stream if I figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.280" end="01:39:11.150" style="s2">actually fix this thing but so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.410" end="01:39:13.840" style="s2">take a quick overview of what it is if</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.150" end="01:39:17.470" style="s2">anybody wants to look through it</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.840" end="01:39:24.800" style="s2">basically the idea of a compressor is</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.470" end="01:39:29.840" style="s2">you have a you have a model and you have</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.800" end="01:39:32.980" style="s2">a coda so the model says the model</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.840" end="01:39:32.980" style="s2">answers the question</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.800" end="01:39:40.239" style="s2">given the probability actually yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.040" end="01:39:43.929" style="s2">know basically you want to ask the</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.239" end="01:39:50.710" style="s2">question what is probability of symbol X</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.929" end="01:39:54.449" style="s2">given symbol 1 through X minus 1 or</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.710" end="01:39:57.449" style="s2">really suppose there&#39;s much model</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.449" end="01:39:57.449" style="s2">answers</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.150" end="01:40:09.210" style="s2">and then we have the code now what the</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.770" end="01:40:13.410" style="s2">coder does is simple arithmetic code</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.210" end="01:40:15.770" style="s2">there two symbols what what the coder</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.410" end="01:40:18.390" style="s2">then does if you know this probability</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.770" end="01:40:21.960" style="s2">right so if you knew exactly what the</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.390" end="01:40:25.380" style="s2">next symbol was going to be you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.960" end="01:40:27.150" style="s2">need you wouldn&#39;t need a coder right you</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.380" end="01:40:29.550" style="s2">could just run them all on the model</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.150" end="01:40:30.870" style="s2">would generate your whole text but you</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.550" end="01:40:31.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly what the next symbol</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.870" end="01:40:33.120" style="s2">is gonna be you know with some</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.740" end="01:40:38.340" style="s2">probability what the next sentence gonna</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.120" end="01:40:41.190" style="s2">be so let&#39;s say you&#39;re 80% sure the next</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.340" end="01:40:43.110" style="s2">symbol is going to be a 1 and your 20%</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.190" end="01:40:44.280" style="s2">Shore therefore the 20% sure it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.110" end="01:40:47.040" style="s2">be a 0 if you&#39;re in a two symbol</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.280" end="01:40:52.520" style="s2">alphabet right so now we can do math log</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.040" end="01:40:52.520" style="s2">2 of 0.8 oh wait no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.889" end="01:41:06.940" style="s2">- lot log - we need Python 3 and then so</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.269" end="01:41:09.469" style="s2">if we yeah so if if the next let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.940" end="01:41:11.239" style="s2">about this for a sec</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.469" end="01:41:14.050" style="s2">this is a little bit what trip you have</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.239" end="01:41:29.539" style="s2">last time but but basically if you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.050" end="01:41:31.999" style="s2">your distribution better than if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.539" end="01:41:36.050" style="s2">a 50% chance for each if it&#39;s 50/50 oh</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.999" end="01:41:37.999" style="s2">it&#39;s 1 / ok if it&#39;s 50/50 then it takes</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.050" end="01:41:40.610" style="s2">one bit of information to cope right</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.999" end="01:41:42.949" style="s2">because it&#39;s 50/50 right but if you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.610" end="01:41:44.929" style="s2">that it&#39;s point 8 it takes point 3 bits</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.949" end="01:41:48.139" style="s2">of information to go point 3 2 bits of</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.929" end="01:41:49.909" style="s2">information but if you get it wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.139" end="01:41:52.219" style="s2">it actually turns out to be the point 2</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.909" end="01:41:53.059" style="s2">then it takes 2 point 3 bits of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.219" end="01:41:56.150" style="s2">all right because there&#39;s no free lunch</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.059" end="01:41:58.400" style="s2">so if your model is wrong it takes more</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.150" end="01:42:00.199" style="s2">than one bit to code that bit and if</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.400" end="01:42:03.679" style="s2">your model is right it takes less than</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.199" end="01:42:08.869" style="s2">one bit to code that back so the</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.679" end="01:42:15.590" style="s2">theoretical limit given your model is</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.869" end="01:42:19.550" style="s2">computed right here in CDW your</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.590" end="01:42:22.130" style="s2">theoretical limit is computed here so -</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.550" end="01:42:23.780" style="s2">that log tail so I think I add I just do</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.130" end="01:42:31.309" style="s2">this see how that works so it&#39;s so the</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.780" end="01:42:34.099" style="s2">identity right so that&#39;s theoretical the</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.309" end="01:42:36.019" style="s2">arithmetic coder gets really close to</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.099" end="01:42:37.729" style="s2">the optimal in fact the only place where</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.019" end="01:42:39.949" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong is is my floating-point</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.729" end="01:42:41.869" style="s2">rounding errors and my moving the</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.949" end="01:42:44.719" style="s2">probability is off of off of the rails</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.869" end="01:42:47.419" style="s2">because of course if you predict</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.719" end="01:42:48.919" style="s2">something with probability 1 it takes no</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.419" end="01:42:50.749" style="s2">bits at all to encode but if you predict</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.919" end="01:42:53.169" style="s2">something with probability 0 you get a</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.749" end="01:42:57.320" style="s2">math domain error so don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.169" end="01:43:00.039" style="s2">avoid math domain heiress oh I think my</p>
