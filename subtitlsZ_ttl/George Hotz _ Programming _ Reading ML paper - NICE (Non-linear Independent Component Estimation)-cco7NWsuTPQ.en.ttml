<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">to get before you read the paper all</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">right so the reason we&#39;re eating this</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">paper so I check out archived sanity a</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">called glow from open AI well okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this paper called wave glow and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">then I looked up below by open AI in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">general you know this is how citations</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">work right if you track them back you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">eventually get to better papers so then</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:01:00.350" style="s2">this paper came out called glue and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">this paper referred to this paper nice</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.350" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">nonlinear independent components</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">explanation estimation I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">understand what that means but on the</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">by by using whatever his trick is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">contained in this paper we propose a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">deep learning framework for modeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">complex high dimensional densities</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">called alright</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:18.620" style="s2">so let&#39;s try to figure out what a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">density means in this context oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.620" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">sorry my chat I haven&#39;t been looking at</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:35.329" style="s2">paper today oh I like that idea we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.799" end="00:02:37.459" style="s2">make a reading group oh with your new</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.329" end="00:02:40.939" style="s2">paper every day um so let me bring up</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.459" end="00:02:42.950" style="s2">the chat on my phone again so I can see</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.659" end="00:03:00.049" style="s2">figured that was the best way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.519" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">with the fact that my monitor is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.049" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">sixteen by nine it but it is 16 by 10 oh</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.920" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">you know like rice with terminal reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.769" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">paper shop yeah so do what are they all</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:24.819" style="s2">not supposed to talk loudly in the cloud</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:27.590" style="s2">but I went to the supermarket today guys</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.800" end="00:06:06.979" style="s2">so don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll also be coding on</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.740" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">this stream it won&#39;t just be a I know</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.979" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">you like eating stream it won&#39;t just be</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.500" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">when I call this one in 90 Solon</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.909" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">capitals so I have a theory that let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.860" end="00:06:42.430" style="s2">so we have this matrix</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.270" end="00:07:05.979" style="s2">and want to be rich with scam stream on</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.729" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">twitch and get people to subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.979" end="00:07:56.919" style="s2">you think that&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">so mmm I&#39;m not saying okay you have pip</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:08.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like pie pie - M pip or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:17.620" style="s2">um all right before we play around with</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.530" end="00:08:21.370" style="s2">this more let&#39;s read the paper we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.620" end="00:08:23.409" style="s2">reading this paper I don&#39;t know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">are gonna like reading stream but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.409" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">doing readings - don&#39;t be racist no</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:50.110" style="s2">racism on my stream all people eat the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:51.579" style="s2">same nope that&#39;s true we&#39;re reading this</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.110" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">paper we&#39;re gonna understand what all</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.579" end="00:08:57.850" style="s2">these words mean so this guy&#39;s famous</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:09:00.730" style="s2">y&#39;all know he&#39;s famous but here&#39;s a star</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.850" end="00:09:04.810" style="s2">next to his name oh well we got it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.730" end="00:09:11.740" style="s2">always a c4 senior fellow complex high</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.810" end="00:09:13.270" style="s2">dimensional densities so I think what</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.740" end="00:09:14.680" style="s2">they&#39;re saying here is like if you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.270" end="00:09:16.449" style="s2">like a picture right you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.680" end="00:09:18.579" style="s2">a picture where each pixels dimension</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.449" end="00:09:19.990" style="s2">and then you can think of like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.579" end="00:09:25.510" style="s2">pictures people&#39;s faces and those</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.990" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">pictures are embedded like they are in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.510" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">that high dimensional space first</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:36.339" style="s2">purpose nonlinear determinative</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.889" end="00:10:12.839" style="s2">okay so independent with respect to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.749" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">what is a factorize distribution and why</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.839" end="00:10:18.869" style="s2">do I need to know the determinant of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.740" end="00:23:56.450" style="s2">explain it to me I think I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:57.920" style="s2">sit here for an hour the only question</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.450" end="00:24:04.910" style="s2">is do I want to sit here with you guys I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.920" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sit here alone is this a</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.740" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m tempted to sit alone and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.650" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">is what I was doing tonight I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">I&#39;d bring you guys along make flappybird</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.330" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">do we want to make flappy bird but what</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.680" end="00:24:54.040" style="s2">is flappy bird all right let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:54.040" style="s2">flappy bird let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:01.400" style="s2">twitch flappy sure you sure you really</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.540" end="00:25:03.230" style="s2">do this this is really what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.400" end="00:25:04.310" style="s2">do we&#39;re not gonna learn anything doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.230" end="00:25:06.110" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.310" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">give you something gonna learn something</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.110" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">do it when I&#39;m making shitty flappy bird</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:24.680" style="s2">all right some scratch and see that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:25.670" style="s2">sounds awful you&#39;re not gonna learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.680" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">anything they&#39;re just gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.389" end="00:25:53.399" style="s2">no no no I knew what maximum likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.399" style="s2">estimation is I we can look it up</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:36.450" style="s2">I mean yeah it&#39;s okay use pencil and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.010" end="00:26:43.850" style="s2">paper to break the equations down and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.450" end="00:26:54.980" style="s2">why is it taking a log okay all right</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.850" end="00:26:54.980" style="s2">well okay so these are my new samples</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.170" end="00:27:03.210" style="s2">what should we call let&#39;s call them big</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.580" end="00:27:04.830" style="s2">X all right and now our goal is to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.210" end="00:27:08.280" style="s2">some function f that&#39;s going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.830" end="00:27:13.400" style="s2">this back into that I just multiplied it</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.280" end="00:27:13.400" style="s2">by a random matrix this should be doable</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.980" end="00:27:31.350" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right you&#39;re right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.150" end="00:27:41.040" style="s2">have MATLAB do I have that one I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.350" end="00:27:45.000" style="s2">that lap well no sirree knowledge okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.040" end="00:27:50.270" style="s2">they have topcoat I mean the codes</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:50.270" style="s2">probably easier not nice get up</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.290" end="00:28:29.770" style="s2">standard normal</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.750" end="00:28:43.720" style="s2">we only support MLP encoder we only</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:48.610" style="s2">support by objective layers with given</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.720" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">inference compute the log likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.610" end="00:28:57.430" style="s2">a batch according to the model</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:29:06.780" style="s2">distribution okay so we have this X we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.430" end="00:29:06.780" style="s2">can look at the shape of X get F prop</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.890" end="00:29:28.600" style="s2">okay so the log likelihood is the prior</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.570" end="00:29:33.850" style="s2">plus the log dat Jack get F prop and log</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.600" end="00:29:36.940" style="s2">dat dacovian the state of the layer and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.850" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">log have to go wow okay if self in code</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.940" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">or is not long great</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:47.580" style="s2">alright so we need the encoder now</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.139" end="00:30:02.729" style="s2">see the x4 how to use it</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.210" end="00:30:47.389" style="s2">okay so we have some log likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.419" end="00:30:50.869" style="s2">the prior then if we want a sample from</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.389" end="00:30:52.669" style="s2">the distribution we have to have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.869" end="00:30:59.809" style="s2">thing self encoder okay so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.669" end="00:31:03.649" style="s2">what that set so is instance encoder I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.809" end="00:31:05.690" style="s2">okay okay so that&#39;s the MLP here this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.649" end="00:31:09.049" style="s2">the encoder and it&#39;s written pi learned</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.690" end="00:31:16.369" style="s2">- I don&#39;t know the last person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.049" end="00:31:19.070" style="s2">written anything in PI learned to his</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.369" end="00:31:24.349" style="s2">instance encoder MLP so it should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.070" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">like class MLP we&#39;re actually the MLP is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.349" end="00:31:32.509" style="s2">just defined here and PI learn two</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:40.539" style="s2">models MLP I learned who hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.509" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">used in centuries multi-layer perceptron</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.539" end="00:31:45.379" style="s2">so I mean this is what they used to call</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">neural networks back in like forever ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.379" end="00:31:56.710" style="s2">like 2004 just see what the initializer</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:56.710" style="s2">is for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.580" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">this possible heart attack and will</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.870" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">appear to be okay so layers batch sighs</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.370" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">now I assume there&#39;s an activation</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.390" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">function is there an activation function</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.620" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">has a header encoder see where did these</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">things come from this sure doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.400" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">all right so maybe it&#39;s only here in</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.820" end="00:36:46.089" style="s2">matrices this is interesting well</p>

<p begin="00:36:48.859" end="00:36:54.440" style="s2">are simply the product of the diagonal</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.440" end="00:36:58.490" style="s2">test time okay I mean this is just an</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.810" end="00:37:06.890" style="s2">interesting idea and of itself right</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.490" end="00:37:15.230" style="s2">like if you have a neural network by</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.890" end="00:37:17.869" style="s2">ejective activation functions triangular</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.230" end="00:37:20.060" style="s2">Jacobian I mean this interesting idea in</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.869" end="00:37:25.819" style="s2">and of itself right like taking the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.060" end="00:37:29.890" style="s2">inverse of a neural network if you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.819" end="00:37:29.890" style="s2">a neural networks what&#39;s the Lu function</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:38.890" style="s2">the equation for tell you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.410" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just that so let&#39;s say like hey I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.839" end="00:38:10.349" style="s2">want to compute the Lu la Plata and V</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:10.349" style="s2">dot X X X minus 1 if less than zero oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.220" end="00:38:24.270" style="s2">yeah so we want to say is numpy and line</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.790" end="00:38:24.270" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.820" end="00:38:46.530" style="s2">yes we can just do it so I&#39;m gonna do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.020" end="00:38:46.530" style="s2">plot it we can do this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:55.300" style="s2">so that&#39;s an Lu which is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.150" end="00:38:58.250" style="s2">invertible function which is pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.300" end="00:38:59.840" style="s2">and matrices are invertible as well so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.250" end="00:39:03.310" style="s2">maybe those are the things that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.840" end="00:39:03.310" style="s2">this is what they&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.030" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">the architectural model is crucial to</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:14.600" style="s2">this computation is straightforward it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.920" end="00:39:16.130" style="s2">actually interesting how yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.600" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">really invertible most of these things</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.130" end="00:39:33.740" style="s2">are many square matrices M can also be</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:37.850" style="s2">expressed as a product of upper and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.740" end="00:39:56.750" style="s2">lower triangular matrices so this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.850" end="00:40:01.900" style="s2">like SVD because no SVD triangular</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.150" end="00:40:29.099" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s bioactive do I read books</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.380" end="00:40:29.099" style="s2">a lot sometimes sometimes you read books</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.140" end="00:40:40.109" style="s2">I eat of the axes like the best function</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:44.019" style="s2">ever don&#39;t read any articles</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.109" end="00:40:47.739" style="s2">news is for losers losers really do</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.019" end="00:40:57.819" style="s2">losers spread news tune out the modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.739" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">propaganda do your part there were some</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.819" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">news rise with loser</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.359" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">talking about how if you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.980" end="00:41:34.890" style="s2">understand a paper you gotta like write</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.680" end="00:42:20.030" style="s2">sampling all right let&#39;s just make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.590" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">little neural network and then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.030" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">take the inverse of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.300" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">well can we make an invertible M nest</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.660" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of an interesting idea so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.450" end="00:43:04.910" style="s2">cool as new Karass is built into tensor</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:11.710" style="s2">flow so you can say things like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.910" end="00:43:13.850" style="s2">I do import tensor flow dr. oz as cross</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.710" end="00:43:22.280" style="s2">and then can I say that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.850" end="00:43:24.080" style="s2">oh yeah doesn&#39;t work let&#39;s see it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.990" end="00:44:38.630" style="s2">mean it just kind of can we take an EM</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.630" end="00:44:40.430" style="s2">missed and can we train and can we train</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.630" end="00:44:43.430" style="s2">like the typical classifier in that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.430" end="00:44:53.170" style="s2">then can we invert that net and try to</p>

<p begin="01:11:57.420" end="01:12:06.430" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t buy a Bitcoin you can&#39;t buy a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.500" end="01:12:08.650" style="s2">Bitcoin I was talking to someone about</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.430" end="01:12:11.350" style="s2">like like why is Bitcoin priced at what</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.650" end="01:12:14.290" style="s2">it is and again you know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.350" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">really don&#39;t understand economics do you</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.290" end="01:12:20.050" style="s2">guys want to know why Bitcoin why</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:21.400" style="s2">bitcoin is priced at what it is I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.050" end="01:12:35.620" style="s2">tell you why bitcoin is priced at what</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.400" end="01:12:38.800" style="s2">it is go watch one Bitcoin oh it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.620" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">exactly one BTC one Bitcoin is worth six</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:49.630" style="s2">thousand five hundred thirty two dollars</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:51.930" style="s2">because exactly doesn&#39;t the official AWS</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.630" end="01:12:51.930" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.720" end="01:13:04.770" style="s2">well it&#39;s taking a long time to load</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.900" end="01:13:15.909" style="s2">I&#39;m in the cloud Bros no bitcoins price</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.230" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">is exactly what it is because of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.909" end="01:13:19.340" style="s2">because these people up here are willing</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:21.800" style="s2">to buy it</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.340" end="01:13:24.469" style="s2">and these people down here are willing</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.800" end="01:13:28.250" style="s2">to sell it and the price is just where</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.469" end="01:13:30.020" style="s2">those two things meet right here this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.250" end="01:13:32.510" style="s2">exactly what a Bitcoin is worth this</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.020" end="01:13:38.330" style="s2">much money because these are by orders</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.510" end="01:13:46.489" style="s2">and these are sell orders that to truly</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.330" end="01:13:52.670" style="s2">understand what markets are supply and</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.489" end="01:14:07.130" style="s2">demand well yeah I mean it&#39;s our what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.670" end="01:14:09.050" style="s2">on the AWS stream is it any good that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.130" end="01:14:15.100" style="s2">how the entire market works now really</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.050" end="01:14:15.100" style="s2">internalize those facts all right</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.380" end="01:14:36.050" style="s2">back to learning things here and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.490" end="01:14:37.700" style="s2">number of viewers really goes up yes I</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.050" end="01:14:41.330" style="s2">did I opened an order book and said</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.700" end="01:14:42.980" style="s2">that&#39;s why bitcoins that price oh hey I</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.330" end="01:14:44.510" style="s2">am machine learning at Amazon okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.980" end="01:14:46.490" style="s2">alright we got a competition all right</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.510" end="01:14:53.300" style="s2">let&#39;s start code all right</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.490" end="01:14:56.450" style="s2">so what we&#39;re gonna try to do first we</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.300" end="01:15:07.100" style="s2">got to understand where&#39;s that one with</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.450" end="01:15:09.250" style="s2">twitch I don&#39;t want to not torch pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.100" end="01:15:09.250" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.570" end="01:16:00.330" style="s2">as it works we&#39;re reading nice could</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:02.230" style="s2">someone link the paper please</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.330" end="01:16:03.670" style="s2">should I just figure out to put the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.230" end="01:16:05.850" style="s2">paper like in the description or</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.670" end="01:16:05.850" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.620" end="01:16:29.760" style="s2">all right now it&#39;s in the description</p>

<p begin="01:18:48.980" end="01:19:02.720" style="s2">here nothing is toxic</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.110" end="01:19:04.760" style="s2">here is toxic everyone here it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.720" end="01:19:06.140" style="s2">attitude if we get too many people will</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.760" end="01:19:08.900" style="s2">just shut it down and I won&#39;t stream on</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.140" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">Twitch anymore you know um math</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.900" end="01:19:13.160" style="s2">prerequisites I understand the paper I</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:16.610" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s that much like deep</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.160" end="01:19:19.880" style="s2">math involved um I mean you should</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.610" end="01:19:23.830" style="s2">understand what a Jacobian is like ass</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.880" end="01:19:26.210" style="s2">cuz they use the word a lot but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.830" end="01:19:27.500" style="s2">understand why all right let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.210" end="01:19:28.430" style="s2">want to figure this out I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.500" end="01:19:31.670" style="s2">still one of the best trees we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.430" end="01:19:37.670" style="s2">have to solve what is a Jacobian</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.670" end="01:19:41.000" style="s2">determinant jacobi imagination all first</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.670" end="01:19:44.620" style="s2">order partial derivatives post its</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.000" end="01:19:44.620" style="s2">matrix and the determinant</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.670" end="01:20:02.250" style="s2">yeah I mean you tell my basic calculus</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.780" end="01:20:07.260" style="s2">calculus hopefully I was understand</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.250" end="01:20:08.580" style="s2">calculus all right um so let&#39;s try what</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.260" end="01:20:21.000" style="s2">I was saying before about making it</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.580" end="01:20:52.740" style="s2">invertible so let&#39;s just go whoops 784</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.000" end="01:20:56.390" style="s2">784 and then tell you I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.740" end="01:20:56.390" style="s2">to make an invertible neural map</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.650" end="01:21:16.950" style="s2">so in theory what happens if I say like</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.240" end="01:21:42.780" style="s2">work it&#39;s not gonna work it on and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.950" end="01:21:45.720" style="s2">could make a sequential I think I have</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.780" end="01:21:48.030" style="s2">to make a tensor out of this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.720" end="01:22:11.010" style="s2">really know how to make just torch</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.030" end="01:22:17.730" style="s2">tensor so eyes much oh because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.010" end="01:22:27.050" style="s2">gonna want to say reshape one let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.730" end="01:22:27.050" style="s2">say for cool</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.830" end="01:22:36.640" style="s2">um it seems like they all went the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.140" end="01:22:38.130" style="s2">yeah I considered streaming from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.640" end="01:22:44.110" style="s2">transistor</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.130" end="01:22:47.830" style="s2">maybe maybe all right so I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.110" end="01:22:49.330" style="s2">know how to use pi torch but I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.830" end="01:23:27.130" style="s2">I should get better at it researchers</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.330" end="01:23:29.380" style="s2">tend to like it so big now something</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.130" end="01:23:31.210" style="s2">like I just you know just work right</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.380" end="01:23:37.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a slice like that I cool what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.210" end="01:23:45.210" style="s2">same thing it just seemed looks like as</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.270" end="01:23:45.210" style="s2">an image time pie</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.300" end="01:24:07.950" style="s2">take all numpy on the Vario that</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.430" end="01:24:09.480" style="s2">requires grad I so we&#39;re just we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.950" end="01:24:12.800" style="s2">running through the stupid little neuron</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.480" end="01:24:12.800" style="s2">that I made we&#39;re gonna see what we get</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.900" end="01:24:22.500" style="s2">can I do this so that&#39;s what M this</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.000" end="01:24:24.870" style="s2">looks like when you like visualize it</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.500" end="01:24:32.190" style="s2">like that you know is that my phone</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.870" end="01:24:33.450" style="s2">locked in her chest we&#39;ll probably like</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.190" end="01:24:35.130" style="s2">some of the highlights for this channel</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.450" end="01:24:35.910" style="s2">ever this channel is only gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.130" end="01:24:37.680" style="s2">downhill from here</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.910" end="01:24:40.200" style="s2">that&#39;s all I can this kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.680" end="01:24:41.550" style="s2">distribution looks like right so we can</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.200" end="01:24:52.980" style="s2">kind of see where things coming up with</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.550" end="01:24:59.550" style="s2">things from the distribution why I got</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.980" end="01:25:08.550" style="s2">dumped I can&#39;t call an umpire on</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.550" end="01:25:16.010" style="s2">variable that requires grad to last to</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.550" end="01:25:19.230" style="s2">be that&#39;s one way that didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.010" end="01:25:23.310" style="s2">can&#39;t call numpy on variable that</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.230" end="01:25:26.930" style="s2">requires grad these are detached on pi</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.310" end="01:25:26.930" style="s2">does anyone understand what that is</p>

<p begin="01:34:34.440" end="01:34:50.510" style="s2">that let&#39;s do one step few steps man</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.030" end="01:34:50.510" style="s2">that much steps</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.599" end="01:35:12.599" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.979" end="01:35:34.760" style="s2">not in man now I&#39;m stable you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.119" end="01:35:34.760" style="s2">what&#39;s always stable Adam here&#39;s Adam</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.270" end="01:35:57.900" style="s2">I&#39;ll look Adam always stable so slow</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.500" end="01:36:01.170" style="s2">though beautiful see what it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.900" end="01:36:04.740" style="s2">now okay good so now you can see that it</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.170" end="01:36:11.340" style="s2">matches all right so let&#39;s learn the</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.740" end="01:36:13.590" style="s2">inverse Adams an optimize our google it</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.340" end="01:36:18.090" style="s2">all right so this learns to inverted</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.590" end="01:36:26.610" style="s2">mists so now let&#39;s take a sample it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.090" end="01:36:40.020" style="s2">just a model extra choice works we have</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.610" end="01:36:50.490" style="s2">to say like X check this sob an</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.020" end="01:36:53.630" style="s2">inclusive or exclusive perfect probably</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.490" end="01:36:58.980" style="s2">you know it was a probabilistic test</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.630" end="01:37:04.560" style="s2">shape sub-zero model exchange CC sixty</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.980" end="01:37:06.300" style="s2">plus one detached numpy we should</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.560" end="01:37:07.200" style="s2">actually just say I wish you call this X</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.300" end="01:37:10.350" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.200" end="01:37:17.630" style="s2">- OH xx die already</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.350" end="01:37:25.260" style="s2">okay wait 28 all this one y model X X</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.630" end="01:37:28.220" style="s2">now we learn a nice numpy inverter built</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.260" end="01:37:28.220" style="s2">in our groups</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.980" end="01:37:36.280" style="s2">yeah look this upside down alright so</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.410" end="01:37:43.020" style="s2">you see my function learn to turn that</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.280" end="01:37:47.980" style="s2">into that oh yeah oh yeah get it get it</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.020" end="01:37:51.450" style="s2">alright let&#39;s add in a bunch more stupid</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.980" end="01:37:51.450" style="s2">layers and see if it gets to learn it I</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.600" end="01:37:56.250" style="s2">was gonna take forever because no GPU oh</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.700" end="01:38:14.640" style="s2">come on the GPU you guys I&#39;m poor and</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.020" end="01:38:17.950" style="s2">poor on GPU so learn that words ok</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.640" end="01:38:23.310" style="s2">inverter hi whoo ok so we&#39;re turning</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.950" end="01:38:27.060" style="s2">threes into backward 3 inverter hi cool</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.310" end="01:38:32.830" style="s2">that&#39;s good that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.060" end="01:38:35.740" style="s2">now let&#39;s invert the function and see if</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.830" end="01:38:38.440" style="s2">it can turn this into that well first</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.740" end="01:38:49.920" style="s2">let&#39;s just try it I mean this model</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.440" end="01:38:53.190" style="s2">hypothetically should just be so work</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.920" end="01:38:53.190" style="s2">let me go</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.540" end="01:39:12.830" style="s2">Oh to Python 3 now we have Python 3</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.110" end="01:39:16.580" style="s2">programmer that&#39;s 110 said oh so we have</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.830" end="01:39:17.180" style="s2">to say ten sir why why I want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.580" end="01:39:20.600" style="s2">up there</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.180" end="01:39:23.200" style="s2">name ten so it&#39;s not defined torch top</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.600" end="01:39:23.200" style="s2">ten center</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.639" end="01:39:35.860" style="s2">okay so it kind of works in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.880" end="01:39:37.300" style="s2">but like not really right so but that</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.860" end="01:39:39.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually invert the function I</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.300" end="01:39:40.900" style="s2">just like put it in because the function</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.010" end="01:39:43.090" style="s2">is like the inversor itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.900" end="01:39:45.300" style="s2">knocking now we should actually be able</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.090" end="01:39:51.730" style="s2">to completely invert this because</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.300" end="01:40:08.590" style="s2">matrices can be inverted and because Lu</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.730" end="01:40:11.320" style="s2">can be inverted when you figure how to</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.590" end="01:40:14.469" style="s2">do this there isn&#39;t that and</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.320" end="01:40:15.520" style="s2">sublime said some stuff about that I</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.469" end="01:40:41.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t pipe I this morning</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.520" end="01:40:44.889" style="s2">oh and D FAA yeah those four CTF no</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.050" end="01:40:46.710" style="s2">stupid coupling law thing no this is way</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.889" end="01:40:49.060" style="s2">better I&#39;m actually inverting the model</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.710" end="01:40:50.710" style="s2">so they made a claim in their paper</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.060" end="01:40:52.389" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to copy the paper</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.710" end="01:40:53.710" style="s2">exactly I don&#39;t totally understand the</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.389" end="01:40:54.790" style="s2">paper I think the best way to understand</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.710" end="01:40:58.420" style="s2">it is to like build something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.790" end="01:41:01.030" style="s2">like not exactly the right thing but</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.420" end="01:41:03.850" style="s2">yeah so they&#39;re saying they make some</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.030" end="01:41:05.679" style="s2">claim one way to use this observation</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.850" end="01:41:07.989" style="s2">would be to build a neural network with</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.679" end="01:41:10.630" style="s2">triangular weight matrices and by</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.989" end="01:41:12.370" style="s2">ejective activation functions so we are</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.630" end="01:41:19.449" style="s2">using a bioactive activation function</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.370" end="01:41:25.780" style="s2">the Lu function is by jected limiting</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.449" end="01:41:29.190" style="s2">design choices to depth to depth like</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.780" end="01:41:29.190" style="s2">get it okay fine</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.760" end="01:41:35.159" style="s2">so we have this thing called model we</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.650" end="01:41:35.159" style="s2">can say</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.909" end="01:41:45.340" style="s2">um can you guys see this okay by the way</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.420" end="01:41:50.610" style="s2">I didn&#39;t like my face is there should I</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.340" end="01:41:53.969" style="s2">put my face up here I can move my face I</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.610" end="01:42:02.110" style="s2">like code over there</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.969" end="01:42:03.580" style="s2">hey face up here so better cool and now</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.110" end="01:42:18.489" style="s2">I&#39;m like coding over here that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.580" end="01:42:20.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m sorry okay how the first one is</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.489" end="01:42:26.280" style="s2">a stupid one the first one is this</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.980" end="01:42:26.280" style="s2">sequential isn&#39;t what I want</p>

<p begin="01:42:47.550" end="01:42:55.200" style="s2">about a sequential okay so I should</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.460" end="01:42:57.810" style="s2">actually be able to invert that a linear</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.200" end="01:43:00.510" style="s2">layer oh they have biases should we</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.810" end="01:43:29.310" style="s2">retrain this without the bias bias is</p>

<p begin="01:45:56.860" end="01:46:09.060" style="s2">here and so I&#39;m gonna try to invert this</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.500" end="01:46:09.060" style="s2">neural network right and in that linear</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.300" end="01:46:20.770" style="s2">time equals a little in here down that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.200" end="01:46:26.260" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.770" end="01:46:35.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t work no it&#39;s the name of the cat</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.260" end="01:46:35.850" style="s2">allah go oh I cam that waits Waits</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.060" end="01:47:08.040" style="s2">yeah okay so why timed up by is touch it</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.030" end="01:47:13.560" style="s2">so what it is cool okay so now inverse X</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.040" end="01:47:20.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to say this we don&#39;t say so</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.560" end="01:47:26.910" style="s2">first we have to subtract the bias and</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.670" end="01:47:31.350" style="s2">then P and move m dot wait</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.910" end="01:47:33.600" style="s2">well first let&#39;s let&#39;s just do compute X</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.350" end="01:47:37.100" style="s2">and make sure I wrote this right they</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.600" end="01:47:37.100" style="s2">had a real name for it they called it</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.070" end="01:47:47.850" style="s2">yes forward inverse that&#39;s too forward</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.060" end="01:47:48.690" style="s2">first actually I understand how these</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.850" end="01:47:49.920" style="s2">things work</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.690" end="01:47:57.000" style="s2">this should be really easy if I did it</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.920" end="01:48:00.300" style="s2">right okay if type equals linear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.000" end="01:48:01.800" style="s2">probably like a nicer way to do this but</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.300" end="01:48:10.350" style="s2">what we want to say is okay so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.800" end="01:48:19.830" style="s2">claiming it&#39;s x transpose X and if you</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.350" end="01:48:22.520" style="s2">down x and wait T plus I&#39;m done Pius X</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.830" end="01:48:22.520" style="s2">eight-balls</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.770" end="01:48:31.940" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.139" end="01:48:47.830" style="s2">although he acts like you ways to do</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.010" end="01:48:51.040" style="s2">this and numpy isn&#39;t there yeah so we</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.830" end="01:48:51.730" style="s2">just say like an x equals x less than</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.040" end="01:49:01.780" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.730" end="01:49:08.199" style="s2">and we got X this is actually correct</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.780" end="01:49:29.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t that this x + X + NP down X minus</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.199" end="01:49:29.070" style="s2">1 X equals ax ax</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.210" end="01:49:49.880" style="s2">all right so if we did that right</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.260" end="01:49:49.880" style="s2">we should say y equals forward X X sub 0</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.180" end="01:50:08.070" style="s2">0 that parameter object has no attribute</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.670" end="01:50:18.750" style="s2">t1 point can&#39;t call a lump on variable</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.070" end="01:50:32.540" style="s2">that requires grad oh but I did detach</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.750" end="01:50:32.540" style="s2">to detach the bias probably 200 here</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.250" end="01:50:45.490" style="s2">unsupported type for nun type maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.390" end="01:50:53.620" style="s2">is just that parameter object has an</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.490" end="01:50:55.120" style="s2">electric t can&#39;t call number oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.620" end="01:50:58.360" style="s2">gonna have a name for the matrix here</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.120" end="01:51:03.040" style="s2">they call it a let&#39;s just say a little</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.360" end="01:51:17.890" style="s2">I&#39;m not waiting I&#39;m pi not te let&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.040" end="01:51:21.850" style="s2">move this here can&#39;t call numpy on</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.890" end="01:51:24.790" style="s2">variable that requires grant all right</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.850" end="01:51:26.640" style="s2">it&#39;s gold attached here whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.790" end="01:51:38.890" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.640" end="01:51:45.820" style="s2">okay seems good unsupported type oh I</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.890" end="01:51:48.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know a transpose or nun type X</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.820" end="01:51:48.510" style="s2">none type</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.400" end="01:52:02.060" style="s2">Wow turn acts oops</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.490" end="01:52:22.910" style="s2">um NP Tylenol stop transpose oops</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.820" end="01:52:35.210" style="s2">numpad transpose I&#39;m show xx we shape</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.680" end="01:52:49.200" style="s2">show why why are we shape okay that</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.720" end="01:52:55.130" style="s2">works cool all right so that&#39;s oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.200" end="01:52:55.130" style="s2">wait how did that work it has no bias</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.090" end="01:53:00.720" style="s2">that&#39;s so weird</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.140" end="01:53:04.760" style="s2">well actually I kind of understand it</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.720" end="01:53:04.760" style="s2">it&#39;s actually cause of how M show works</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.280" end="01:53:14.280" style="s2">cult</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.190" end="01:53:29.380" style="s2">so now just lets you know throwing up is</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.780" end="01:53:42.880" style="s2">easy here let&#39;s actually add this up</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.380" end="01:53:45.630" style="s2">here okay so that like kind of works but</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.880" end="01:54:20.250" style="s2">not really so let&#39;s try this with</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.630" end="01:54:27.460" style="s2">inverse okay runs up through some values</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.250" end="01:54:29.940" style="s2">okay so we want on Lu what&#39;s the inverse</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.460" end="01:54:32.199" style="s2">of the expo</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.940" end="01:54:38.590" style="s2">where&#39;s my graphic value it&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.199" end="01:54:40.179" style="s2">isn&#39;t it yeah so the inverse value is</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.590" end="01:54:44.199" style="s2">just going to be whatever the inverse of</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.179" end="01:54:58.189" style="s2">the X function is what is the university</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.199" end="01:55:11.119" style="s2">export universe and px who knows that</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.189" end="01:55:11.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just- alright it double negative</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.239" end="01:55:58.530" style="s2">okay so how do we undo that so you undo</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.249" end="01:56:00.389" style="s2">that is you multiply that by just the</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.530" end="01:56:11.789" style="s2">inverse of this and beat ugly now all</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.389" end="01:56:14.519" style="s2">the ton inv so if this worked this thing</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.789" end="01:56:21.989" style="s2">would look like that but it is I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.519" end="01:56:24.650" style="s2">I think my in value is correct we can</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.989" end="01:56:24.650" style="s2">test it quickly</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.989" end="01:56:51.550" style="s2">plot should be a straight line it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.130" end="01:56:51.550" style="s2">temesta</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.520" end="01:57:03.510" style="s2">does that not work even</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.180" end="01:57:16.360" style="s2">gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.470" end="01:57:52.920" style="s2">what are you wrong</p>

<p begin="01:58:32.599" end="01:58:44.750" style="s2">it seems crack just looks shitty when</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.040" end="01:58:44.750" style="s2">you&#39;re ok so it should be right</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.739" end="01:58:49.250" style="s2">no it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.400" end="01:59:11.670" style="s2">ok looks right but it&#39;s not right ok so</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.210" end="01:59:13.800" style="s2">a few things you know +1 in here the</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.670" end="01:59:22.020" style="s2">inverse function is different what is it</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.800" end="01:59:26.090" style="s2">do you know what it is not that not that</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.020" end="01:59:26.090" style="s2">ok whoa for mouth</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.050" end="01:59:41.200" style="s2">so what&#39;s the inverse wait isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.510" end="01:59:42.780" style="s2">inverse of e to the X just long there</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.200" end="01:59:46.180" style="s2">you go</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.780" end="01:59:48.670" style="s2">well I&#39;m dumb of course it&#39;s long this</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.180" end="01:59:53.050" style="s2">literally Wow okay I&#39;m stupid</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.670" end="01:59:55.960" style="s2">that&#39;s cool no jail I know it&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.050" end="01:59:57.460" style="s2">of the inverse value function and if I</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.960" end="02:00:01.360" style="s2">got my matrices right okay that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.460" end="02:00:16.500" style="s2">wrong so now let&#39;s think about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.360" end="02:00:50.770" style="s2">doing wrong with matrices just closed W</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.500" end="02:00:55.060" style="s2">Gavea nope no ox okay um if we have</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.770" end="02:01:05.940" style="s2">something and we dot it with something</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.060" end="02:01:05.940" style="s2">oh no I&#39;m the worst perhaps ever that No</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.800" end="02:01:45.070" style="s2">is it possible to just do inverse on</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.330" end="02:01:57.180" style="s2">this whole thing can I just say towards</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.070" end="02:01:57.180" style="s2">dot inverse model know what that means</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.780" end="02:02:02.680" style="s2">no chasing if it&#39;s the square matrix</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.890" end="02:02:04.210" style="s2">okay this is firm paychecks and we could</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.680" end="02:02:06.120" style="s2">write it but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.210" end="02:02:08.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty read the layers okay</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.120" end="02:02:19.600" style="s2">this is just good for now so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.140" end="02:02:26.460" style="s2">figure out why doesn&#39;t work NP the</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.600" end="02:02:26.460" style="s2">knowledge inverse okay so X dot W</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.790" end="02:02:48.720" style="s2">dot W to the minus one should be the</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.700" end="02:02:48.720" style="s2">opposite is it lagging lag what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.460" end="02:02:56.760" style="s2">okay this should look like something in</p>

<p begin="02:03:03.929" end="02:03:18.239" style="s2">I mean this work should unless these</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.719" end="02:03:21.330" style="s2">matrices are like poorly conditioned or</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.239" end="02:03:27.020" style="s2">something I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s lagging guys</p>

<p begin="02:03:47.550" end="02:03:51.530" style="s2">that&#39;s like a de transpose here</p>

<p begin="02:04:03.580" end="02:04:10.140" style="s2">yes and that breaks that so yeah you get</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.970" end="02:04:10.140" style="s2">this wrong it breaks</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.710" end="02:05:32.170" style="s2">you might check to see if these things</p>

<p begin="02:32:26.960" end="02:32:30.470" style="s2">real neural network stuff but we thought</p>
<p begin="02:32:29.000" end="02:32:34.100" style="s2">we thought a little about invertibility</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.470" end="02:32:34.580" style="s2">of neural networks today what is this</p>
