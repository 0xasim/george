<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:16.680" style="s2">be confused with these hashes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">not these hashes we don&#39;t record the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.680" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">videos anymore you have to watch them</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">live maybe we can make watching the old</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:29.820" style="s2">videos a perk for subscribers I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">know if that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.820" end="00:00:35.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not a twitch expert but you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">that might be possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.780" end="00:00:43.410" style="s2">yeah these brosman I did hear that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">British burned down can I do that can I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">make it a perk for subscribers I&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">into it after this trip I just hear that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:56.210" style="s2">the British burned down the White House</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:56.210" style="s2">at 1812 and that&#39;s why we gotta tax them</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.809" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">I&#39;m very amused the British burned down</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">the White House oh yeah man when I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:22.100" style="s2">bubblesort yesterday all those fun where</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:22.100" style="s2">were we you&#39;re eating crappy optimise</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:47.210" style="s2">winch afghans okay we have to define the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.049" end="00:01:47.210" style="s2">jacobi the fish bro need to Kate Ganim a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:54.140" style="s2">Jacobean ah this one</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:12.440" style="s2">this one really went too far into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:12.440" style="s2"> about your broken website bros</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.489" end="00:02:29.849" style="s2">so we don&#39;t care about these intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.130" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">parameters of the camera look they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.849" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">doing it symbolically oh so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:48.989" style="s2">thing called senpai which can do</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">symbolic jacobians I&#39;ll install actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.989" end="00:02:52.769" style="s2">you know what this might not be that bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:57.329" style="s2">right so we have the parameter vector</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.769" end="00:02:59.690" style="s2">and we have the measurement vector and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.329" end="00:03:11.549" style="s2">we have the function that relates them</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.690" end="00:03:15.139" style="s2">just wait 10 minute so let&#39;s see did</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:15.139" style="s2">some PI install will give senpai</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.980" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">[Music]</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.380" end="00:03:57.940" style="s2">so this doesn&#39;t seem bad so from simp I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">import matrix</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">say x equals matrix a like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.400" end="00:05:18.850" style="s2">right we wanted to find actually respect</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.260" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">to be yeah we&#39;re not save those dreams</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:23.710" style="s2">anymore gotta watch them live bro I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">think we don&#39;t make that a perk for</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.710" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">subscribers so if you are a subscriber</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">then you get that perk unless you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:42.790" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:51.729" style="s2">oh no maybe no sin pi let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.790" end="00:05:54.340" style="s2">try to understand perk for followers</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.729" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">always if I can do that I&#39;ll look right</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.340" end="00:06:04.380" style="s2">now you know what let&#39;s let&#39;s Google</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">together twitch old streams available to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.380" end="00:06:12.090" style="s2">followers not followers but subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:12.090" style="s2">is what I want people who pay me money</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.910" end="00:06:20.480" style="s2">five reasons no one is watching their</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.590" end="00:06:25.190" style="s2">two extremes let&#39;s learn how to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.480" end="00:06:28.790" style="s2">twister you just launched your channel</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.190" end="00:06:32.870" style="s2">no schedule we have a schedule we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.790" end="00:06:35.150" style="s2">communicate my stream is not about my</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.870" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">audience sorry people and I&#39;m certainly</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.270" end="00:07:43.810" style="s2">on the Rodrigues formula oh well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna have to solve dude</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.810" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">I could be a twitch stop I&#39;m gonna wear</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:08:00.340" style="s2">a wig twitch thats twitch that&#39;s okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:01.030" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting it never be like</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">modeled well I moved to New York when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.030" end="00:08:20.620" style="s2">moved to New York my house can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">man I already know what you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.620" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">nice to have to come hey guys it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.780" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">be sweet</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.290" end="00:09:02.439" style="s2">okay where we were watching tutorials</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.759" end="00:09:09.610" style="s2">again so we go right to that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.439" end="00:09:11.199" style="s2">keynote one was pretty good well the Mac</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:19.089" style="s2">App Store all I hear they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.199" end="00:09:29.970" style="s2">make the Mac App Store better I have an</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.089" end="00:09:29.970" style="s2">advertisement okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.850" end="00:09:40.890" style="s2">we learned yesterday how we were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.130" end="00:09:40.890" style="s2">estimate the Hessian from the Jacobian</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:10:05.650" style="s2">the hash shouldn&#39;t equals the jacobian</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:07.240" style="s2">transpose times w that&#39;s that&#39;s good so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:09.780" style="s2">we just need to define the Jacobi that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.240" end="00:10:09.780" style="s2">where you were yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:37.960" style="s2">yes okay five 3d features so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.010" end="00:10:39.730" style="s2">putting the features there the images</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.960" end="00:10:44.650" style="s2">there and they have camera calibrations</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.730" end="00:10:51.280" style="s2">so we don&#39;t we still put the camera</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.650" end="00:10:56.400" style="s2">calibration in no no there we go that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.280" end="00:11:01.710" style="s2">much okay so what is this a 1 a 2 okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.400" end="00:11:10.330" style="s2">so those are observations so on the each</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.710" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">row what is a parameter and each no each</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.330" end="00:11:17.860" style="s2">column is a parameter and each row oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">thank you thank you now danger 7 thank</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.860" end="00:11:33.540" style="s2">you for subscribing these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:33.540" style="s2">observations and these are parameters</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.980" end="00:11:48.430" style="s2">and like so then this is the jacobian so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.070" end="00:11:50.440" style="s2">so basically we&#39;re asking the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.430" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">what&#39;s the derivative of a with respect</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.440" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2">to a-1 which I don&#39;t think is anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s not like if you move</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.300" end="00:12:05.350" style="s2">the camera your observations gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">change well maybe a well no okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.350" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">the point yeah if I move the point it</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:19.150" style="s2">certainly will change and if I move the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:23.310" style="s2">camera it&#39;ll change as well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.150" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">same picture they use the same picture</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.310" end="00:12:30.580" style="s2">except they made this look terrible okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:31.930" style="s2">we haven&#39;t even written out the Jacobian</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.580" end="00:12:40.150" style="s2">yeah we haven&#39;t even gotten to any of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.930" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">this yet cameras for features okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.150" end="00:12:52.060" style="s2">the other problem is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">parameterize our mr. Oh a o40</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.060" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">thank you for subscribing to my channel</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.730" end="00:13:01.660" style="s2">no you can&#39;t get this hoodie anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.080" end="00:13:04.060" style="s2">this is this is the softest merch in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.660" end="00:13:05.410" style="s2">game after maverick March which is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.060" end="00:13:20.040" style="s2">real Sophos merch in the game and who I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.410" end="00:13:20.040" style="s2">stole that from okay so we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.580" end="00:13:33.190" style="s2">we do need to deal with how we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:38.520" style="s2">parameterize rotation and I do think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.190" end="00:13:38.520" style="s2">have to parameterize it as Euler angles</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:14:04.540" style="s2">okay the problem with a rotation matrix</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:14:07.390" style="s2">is rotation has three degrees of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.540" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">and a rotation matrix has nine so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.390" end="00:14:12.460" style="s2">have to figure out some way to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:13.330" style="s2">stuff about it figure out what I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.460" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">do to us</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.330" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">let&#39;s free GG well we&#39;re you guys</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:48.949" style="s2">let&#39;s see how they parameterize rotation</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.760" end="00:15:52.199" style="s2">is what I&#39;m interested in here Oh edge</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.949" end="00:15:54.230" style="s2">lots of ex-wife Wow look at these people</p>

<p begin="01:07:31.089" end="01:07:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s tiny and still yours take the mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.760" end="01:07:38.829" style="s2">gives one degree 10 will be minus 10</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.650" end="01:07:38.829" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="01:08:14.010" end="01:08:21.080" style="s2">divides by zero and now we get</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.380" end="01:08:33.840" style="s2">we want to compute this symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.980" end="01:09:27.310" style="s2">my favorite writer working we saw that</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.960" end="01:09:27.310" style="s2">as much higher when I mess it up</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.060" end="01:10:49.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.010" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">the idea exciting that you matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.599" end="01:11:18.139" style="s2">because you&#39;re doing a projection it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:18.139" style="s2">kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.690" end="01:12:41.330" style="s2">can actually do better than that so</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.739" end="01:12:46.429" style="s2">really we just need to differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.330" end="01:12:53.270" style="s2">that one function symbolically and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.429" end="01:13:02.860" style="s2">stick that in a lot of places so point</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.270" end="01:13:11.120" style="s2">TW this is so Point has three TW has six</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.860" end="01:13:14.300" style="s2">he has to go back to our bundle</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:19.460" style="s2">adjustment it&#39;s that paper that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.300" end="01:13:23.080" style="s2">liked no this one the bundle adjustment</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.460" end="01:13:23.080" style="s2">to Kobe and matrix okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.760" end="01:13:30.789" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know about camera constrains</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.929" end="01:13:32.799" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we need any of those but</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.789" end="01:13:37.780" style="s2">these projection constraints this is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.799" end="01:13:39.629" style="s2">jacobian so yeah this is this is where</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.780" end="01:13:52.119" style="s2">you get to by knowing from right</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.629" end="01:13:56.709" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t know don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.119" end="01:13:58.629" style="s2">are now but you see easy oh because this</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.709" end="01:14:00.789" style="s2">is this is the jacobian this is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.629" end="01:14:06.129" style="s2">jacobian of nine parameters with respect</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.789" end="01:14:07.179" style="s2">to two parameters if you like stick them</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.129" end="01:14:10.689" style="s2">together it doesn&#39;t really matter so</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.179" end="01:14:13.649" style="s2">it&#39;s like f of you know some nine</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.689" end="01:14:13.649" style="s2">parameter thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.830" end="01:14:36.590" style="s2">and that determines like the external</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.840" end="01:14:40.440" style="s2">encoding why do we use jacobian well</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.590" end="01:14:45.690" style="s2">because the paper says to know so</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.440" end="01:14:51.060" style="s2">Jacobian basically I want to ask the</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.690" end="01:14:54.720" style="s2">question how do I alter these things how</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.060" end="01:14:58.110" style="s2">do i order my input vector to make these</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.720" end="01:15:01.130" style="s2">projection constraints more true this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.110" end="01:15:03.150" style="s2">the question that we&#39;re asking here</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.130" end="01:15:04.650" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I can change I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.150" end="01:15:07.590" style="s2">move my cameras around and I can move my</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.650" end="01:15:12.210" style="s2">three space points around and these</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.590" end="01:15:14.040" style="s2">constraints are all fixed right so here</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.210" end="01:15:30.090" style="s2">we you know we have a measurement vector</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.040" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">of your parameter vector vector so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.090" end="01:15:34.560" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get the Jacobian of others</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:42.750" style="s2">the way to actually talk about this but</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.560" end="01:15:44.810" style="s2">like it&#39;s this with respect to this now</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.750" end="01:15:47.010" style="s2">I think if I could do it for just one</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.810" end="01:15:48.570" style="s2">numerically I think I can just like kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.010" end="01:15:50.190" style="s2">of write that out and once that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.570" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">now I just need to hit it all over the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.190" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">place like that all right</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.210" end="01:16:10.060" style="s2">so we have some big matrix it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.380" end="01:16:11.290" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like this shape by this shape</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.060" end="01:16:15.250" style="s2">let&#39;s make sure I got this right</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.290" end="01:16:19.570" style="s2">okay so each one of those things is</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.250" end="01:16:30.390" style="s2">gonna be a column so I should did that</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.570" end="01:16:35.020" style="s2">as a row so I did that backwards yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.390" end="01:16:44.410" style="s2">that makes sense okay so I can define</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.020" end="01:16:45.910" style="s2">the Jacobian cool but the problem is we</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.410" end="01:16:47.530" style="s2">have to actually get the Jacobian we</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.910" end="01:16:49.480" style="s2">have to actually take the Jacobian of</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.530" end="01:16:52.030" style="s2">this thing let&#39;s see if we can use simp</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.480" end="01:16:59.230" style="s2">I to do that the question is like what</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.030" end="01:17:36.940" style="s2">is J proj I don&#39;t know if that thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.230" end="01:17:40.890" style="s2">that we were using like that work okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.940" end="01:17:40.890" style="s2">so let&#39;s see you end up at five</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.560" end="01:18:02.620" style="s2">work grad only applies to real-valued ah</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.500" end="01:18:07.120" style="s2">try Jacobi and all they even have one</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.620" end="01:18:10.270" style="s2">called Jacobian from Otto grad important</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.120" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">to Colby in all let&#39;s try that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.270" end="01:18:21.130" style="s2">Oh being Raj all right so the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:22.929" style="s2">gradient only applies to scalar value</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.130" end="01:18:30.300" style="s2">output functions jacobians worked on</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.929" end="01:18:36.699" style="s2">vector oh it&#39;s praying something well</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.300" end="01:18:43.090" style="s2">that&#39;s not right this is Jay shape just</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.699" end="01:18:46.510" style="s2">not right like that&#39;s not the right</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.090" end="01:18:48.040" style="s2">shape but maybe cuz it&#39;s stupid and</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.510" end="01:18:58.600" style="s2">can&#39;t handle it maybe it just used that</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.040" end="01:19:01.900" style="s2">as extra parameters right so you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.600" end="01:19:02.610" style="s2">write this pretty easily just say I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.900" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">call it</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.610" end="01:19:21.550" style="s2">ptew well quality so before and after so</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:24.850" style="s2">ill-fortune kids now basically what we</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.550" end="01:19:27.270" style="s2">want to say is gonna concatenate these</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.850" end="01:19:27.270" style="s2">two arrays</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.320" end="01:19:44.260" style="s2">even use concatenate like that but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.389" end="01:19:47.349" style="s2">say projects to position or you ah</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.260" end="01:19:50.800" style="s2">perfect look at the shape of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.349" end="01:19:54.039" style="s2">Jacobian now it&#39;s two by nine and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.800" end="01:19:55.719" style="s2">what we want so then we just have to put</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.039" end="01:20:05.020" style="s2">the thingies in the right place</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.719" end="01:20:06.789" style="s2">oh ho ho we&#39;re rich guys we&#39;re rich the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.020" end="01:20:08.260" style="s2">numerical Jacobian of the projection</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.789" end="01:20:11.860" style="s2">function what does all be really care</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.260" end="01:20:13.539" style="s2">about I mean okay be kind of nice to</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.860" end="01:20:13.900" style="s2">symbolically but I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.539" end="01:20:25.980" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.900" end="01:20:25.980" style="s2">um this is slow boy slow what that is oh</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.400" end="01:20:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s still getting zeros yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.800" end="01:20:40.079" style="s2">want to compute the numerical code I</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.130" end="01:20:48.520" style="s2">think if I use Empire I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.599" end="01:20:50.440" style="s2">write this PGW don&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.520" end="01:20:53.130" style="s2">like it&#39;s easy it&#39;s better to think</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.440" end="01:20:53.130" style="s2">about it this way</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.300" end="01:21:10.140" style="s2">all right so for each basically you see</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.220" end="01:21:16.340" style="s2">oh there&#39;s an 2 by 9 for each row in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.140" end="01:21:16.340" style="s2">matrix so this returns a 2 by 9 thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.890" end="01:21:27.590" style="s2">I&#39;m doing a Jacobian now but let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.840" end="01:21:27.590" style="s2">this Empire coat</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.240" end="01:22:27.770" style="s2">this is going to compute the Jacobian</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.620" end="01:22:27.770" style="s2">symbolically matter like I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.790" end="01:22:58.950" style="s2">check Jacobian respect to x and y okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.790" end="01:23:03.260" style="s2">senpai all right some block matrix is</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.950" end="01:23:12.800" style="s2">fine let me just speak that as a matrix</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.260" end="01:23:12.800" style="s2">matrix a matrix symbol here we go now</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.889" end="01:23:31.419" style="s2">so say if you got your equals s P dot</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.639" end="01:23:46.629" style="s2">matrix are we going to need to redefine</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.419" end="01:23:49.569" style="s2">means to be seven powers that work array</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.629" end="01:23:53.349" style="s2">takes two one positional argument but</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.569" end="01:23:53.829" style="s2">two were given I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.349" end="01:23:57.549" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.829" end="01:24:00.479" style="s2">I mean I guess maybe we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.549" end="01:24:13.839" style="s2">use numpad you want to use like simp I</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.479" end="01:24:17.589" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I can do that one senpai</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.839" end="01:24:18.789" style="s2">has no attribute dot well it hasn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.589" end="01:24:22.659" style="s2">to be a square root we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.789" end="01:24:31.179" style="s2">actually need to do dot there we can say</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.659" end="01:24:35.409" style="s2">SP dots so does that work well senpai</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.179" end="01:24:38.429" style="s2">has no attributes some fine already not</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.409" end="01:24:38.429" style="s2">explicitly cash</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.909" end="01:25:03.310" style="s2">and object has no attribute so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.190" end="01:25:08.380" style="s2">pretty sure some PI does have side it</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.310" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have dot array takes one</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.380" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">positional argument but two we&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.810" end="01:25:34.300" style="s2">it through that okay seven PI matrix</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.040" end="01:25:44.739" style="s2">multiplication oh yes I think maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.300" end="01:25:46.630" style="s2">could just say times and I think you do</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.739" end="01:25:51.880" style="s2">that numpy - oh look at that</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.630" end="01:26:03.489" style="s2">that looks like some all right so</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.880" end="01:26:07.780" style="s2">this is symbolic Jacobian look at that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.489" end="01:26:09.790" style="s2">symbolic Jacobian guys actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.780" end="01:26:16.929" style="s2">doing a symbolically I might not need</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.790" end="01:26:19.810" style="s2">that EPS yeah okay good</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.929" end="01:26:22.770" style="s2">so that&#39;s the very complex symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.810" end="01:26:22.770" style="s2">Jacobian</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.420" end="01:26:42.240" style="s2">so we can say juv okay now simply has a</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.140" end="01:27:12.540" style="s2">way to actually compile that make it</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.240" end="01:27:28.160" style="s2">nice look at that that look right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.540" end="01:27:32.570" style="s2">uses autorap crap oh why am i straight</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.160" end="01:27:36.030" style="s2">guys why is a stupid question</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.570" end="01:27:38.250" style="s2">why do people do things I mean like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.030" end="01:27:39.450" style="s2">like I&#39;m nowhere near as nice as like we</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.250" end="01:27:41.520" style="s2">should find there would be about this</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.450" end="01:27:43.290" style="s2">but like yeah watch what you&#39;d find this</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.520" end="01:27:44.700" style="s2">thing about like like you know he asked</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.290" end="01:27:46.740" style="s2">the question like how to make this work</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:48.120" style="s2">and like you know he&#39;s very polite with</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.740" end="01:27:49.920" style="s2">the journalists but like it&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.120" end="01:27:52.290" style="s2">question like what do you mean how two</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.920" end="01:27:54.240" style="s2">magnets work but like with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.290" end="01:27:56.060" style="s2">what Paul is just like invisible rubber</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.240" end="01:28:00.780" style="s2">bands pulling things together</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.060" end="01:28:04.530" style="s2">Nothe stop at a magnets work go study</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.780" end="01:28:12.690" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s equations right and like aside</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.530" end="01:28:14.730" style="s2">from that there&#39;s no real so why I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.690" end="01:28:20.640" style="s2">don&#39;t question like what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.730" end="01:28:21.540" style="s2">why unclassifiable statement this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.640" end="01:28:28.910" style="s2">much more interesting what does that</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.540" end="01:28:33.860" style="s2">mean oh just trying to compile Fortran</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.910" end="01:28:33.860" style="s2">great it doesn&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.590" end="01:28:41.260" style="s2">okay well that was good while it lasted</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.699" end="01:28:51.010" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways to use autorap I</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.260" end="01:28:58.650" style="s2">think you simp I&#39;d coma its impose</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.010" end="01:29:09.190" style="s2">really great but it does always work</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.650" end="01:29:12.179" style="s2">okay right language equal see back-end F</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.190" end="01:29:13.590" style="s2">2 pi and language C are incompatible</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.179" end="01:29:18.239" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.590" end="01:29:18.239" style="s2">back then equals cipher</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.770" end="01:29:34.330" style="s2">no module name sighs oh oh oh now again</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.050" end="01:29:36.250" style="s2">history and small side well I you want</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.330" end="01:29:39.969" style="s2">me to keep if you enjoy my twitch</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.250" end="01:29:42.310" style="s2">channel please subscribe and send me</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.969" end="01:29:44.320" style="s2">bits and if I see that I&#39;m making money</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.310" end="01:29:45.630" style="s2">off this I will continue to stream</p>

<p begin="01:29:45.630" end="01:29:56.980" style="s2">so I&#39;m scripted value is neither already</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.030" end="01:29:59.670" style="s2">nor pointer what what are you</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.980" end="01:29:59.670" style="s2">complaining about</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.090" end="01:30:09.540" style="s2">ptew like didn&#39;t work that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.010" end="01:30:09.540" style="s2">totally fine see to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.460" end="01:31:11.100" style="s2">okay can I see the C code being</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.900" end="01:31:13.860" style="s2">generated oh man you funkify oh this</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.100" end="01:31:19.260" style="s2">looks so let&#39;s try you funcle&#39; oh oh i</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.860" end="01:31:22.190" style="s2">think i have to pass in don&#39;t get pass</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.260" end="01:31:22.190" style="s2">in something to autorap</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.230" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">try you funkify maybe you bug the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.880" end="01:31:36.719" style="s2">flowers I feel like I have to pass in</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:38.880" style="s2">well let&#39;s actually first just try that</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.719" end="01:31:41.040" style="s2">with I just found a PDW here I think it</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.880" end="01:31:52.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know I think I should that has</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.040" end="01:32:06.739" style="s2">to be an array to know you funkify pass</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.800" end="01:32:17.580" style="s2">it Kiki W and Jake watch mmm error</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.739" end="01:32:23.280" style="s2">passing double to parameter C this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.580" end="01:32:33.690" style="s2">what sucks about simp I like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.280" end="01:32:37.430" style="s2">know what&#39;s wrong now you ready this</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.690" end="01:32:37.430" style="s2">Python there&#39;s a way to do that</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.860" end="01:32:52.469" style="s2">we need binary function we&#39;ll try the</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.510" end="01:33:16.170" style="s2">last one binary function your my final</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.469" end="01:33:21.560" style="s2">hope f J fry huh back to this Fortran</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.170" end="01:33:21.560" style="s2"> that looks okay to me</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.530" end="01:33:39.280" style="s2">except for like what is all this maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.500" end="01:33:39.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.670" end="01:33:58.960" style="s2">okay the only thing I think that could</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.720" end="01:34:10.180" style="s2">be bad maybe is this NP dot array that</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.960" end="01:34:14.950" style="s2">work like I can play write that in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.180" end="01:34:19.860" style="s2">better way it&#39;s thinking about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.950" end="01:34:36.000" style="s2">actually doing there that date is fine</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.860" end="01:34:41.230" style="s2">good MP dot array parentheses like</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.000" end="01:34:45.250" style="s2">matter even though this finish this</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.230" end="01:34:48.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t can I call it I mean I can call</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.250" end="01:34:55.510" style="s2">it what I call like Jake rods with like</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.160" end="01:35:00.610" style="s2">and that zero line I kind of like my</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.510" end="01:35:04.000" style="s2">plus epsilon so we can so sin pi is a</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.610" end="01:35:07.240" style="s2">lot like the ATO in which it&#39;s total</p>

<p begin="02:06:39.690" end="02:06:45.570" style="s2">actually calling the the functions this</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.949" end="02:06:47.369" style="s2">takes a long time I hate when things are</p>

<p begin="02:07:11.900" end="02:07:23.420" style="s2">we can actually compute just I got to</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.240" end="02:07:34.960" style="s2">list here here we can get like JP equals</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.420" end="02:07:34.960" style="s2">F JP pz w JT j w JT f JW right</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.230" end="02:07:39.650" style="s2">each one of these if I did it right</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.700" end="02:07:40.820" style="s2">should be a three by three matrix and</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.650" end="02:07:43.040" style="s2">then we&#39;ll just have to put them in the</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.820" end="02:07:53.270" style="s2">right place and then we&#39;ll have a</p>

<p begin="02:08:17.720" end="02:08:26.840" style="s2">beautiful rotation functions and they</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.410" end="02:08:29.930" style="s2">returned things that are the right shape</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.840" end="02:08:31.430" style="s2">and that have numbers in them so if</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.930" end="02:08:33.950" style="s2">they&#39;re the right shape and they have</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.430" end="02:08:40.400" style="s2">numbers in them you&#39;re probably doing</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.950" end="02:08:42.380" style="s2">pretty well for yourself well I mean</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.400" end="02:08:46.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll go to Starbucks guys maybe we&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="02:09:11.860" end="02:09:23.600" style="s2">so we can save it J so I is the point ID</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.880" end="02:09:33.760" style="s2">you notice the frame ID so first we</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.600" end="02:09:36.230" style="s2">address the row in the matrix the row o</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.760" end="02:09:45.340" style="s2">which we&#39;re gonna die the X for again I</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.230" end="02:10:02.750" style="s2">think I don&#39;t know if we accidentally</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.340" end="02:10:06.890" style="s2">just gonna same j j x 2 plus 2 so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.750" end="02:10:09.050" style="s2">the row in the matrix the column in the</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.890" end="02:10:14.620" style="s2">matrix is of course the point ID which</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.050" end="02:10:14.620" style="s2">is this crap here let&#39;s write the same</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.040" end="02:10:24.590" style="s2">equal JP oh yeah now we set JP now we</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.780" end="02:10:27.560" style="s2">just need to set JT and J you so those</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.590" end="02:10:33.790" style="s2">are the same it&#39;s the same indexing as</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.560" end="02:10:33.790" style="s2">yes that&#39;s so ugly</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.120" end="02:11:10.290" style="s2">take your nap my ex : f by DX plus three</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.510" end="02:11:23.160" style="s2">and this one is Fi the X plus 3 : fi DX</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.290" end="02:11:51.470" style="s2">plus 6 now we have a big J to do because</p>
