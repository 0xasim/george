<p begin="00:00:14.920" end="00:00:18.880" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.640" end="00:00:18.880" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">so i was watching um</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.080" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">shkreli&#39;s finance lectures</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">and he gave</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">lectures with a list of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of financial advice and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">he starts out by saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">what is finance he breaks it down into</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">well okay if you want to get into it you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">have a choice you can either invest your</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:55.280" style="s2">own money or other people&#39;s money</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">um investing your own money probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.280" end="00:01:04.079" style="s2">only makes sense if you have a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:04.079" style="s2">you need tools to uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">right like there&#39;s no reason you should</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">be investing your money if somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">can invest it better</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">basically good advice um so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">i&#39;d do something similar for programming</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">i was watching i i googled</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">how to learn to program</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">uh let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s do this how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">to program</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">also again like you guys think i&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">drugs constantly i&#39;m really not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">um i smoke weed occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">i drink occasionally i don&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">harder drugs than that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve taken adderall or</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">any other stimulants this year</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why you guys all think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s something defective about</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">my brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m not going to teach you vim</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">if you think you want to learn park type</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">thank you for subscribing and i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">to get a lot of subscribers for this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">stream because</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try to educate instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">a lot of times when i talk i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">be made sense of i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to i&#39;m thinking out loud and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">explain things such that an audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">will understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">so we could say yeah look i can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">here here&#39;s lifehacker.com the best ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">to teach yourself to code</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">and really it comes down to just doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">like almost everything but i think a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">question a lot of people have is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">exactly do i do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">let&#39;s bring them up here and let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">about what a program</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">is okay so you have a program what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">definition of a program</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">you can think about it like this a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">program takes in some input</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">does some computation and produces some</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s an argument to be made that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">we should be teaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">kids how to program using functional</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">languages because functional languages</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">more closely match this paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">but computers don&#39;t operate</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">like functions computers operate a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">more like turing machines which we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">get into too so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">on one side of an extreme uh we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">like a high-level functional programming</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">language like haskell</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">and then let&#39;s not really go lower than</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">c c and assembly r</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">c and assembly are the same structurally</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">so you can treat c and assembly like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">same thing see this kind of assembly</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">with a bit of syntactic sugar around it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in c that doesn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">clearly map</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">to something in assembly um</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">please subscribe i hope you guys like</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">this kind of content okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s say like languages uh span the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">gamut</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">from c uh over to haskell right</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">um then you can take languages and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">languages go in a few directions</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">you can think of this as like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">functional spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">uh and then maybe there&#39;s c over to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">python</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">and this is kind of the ease of use</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">so in the 90s it was believed that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">object oriented programming</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">was going to be this revolution in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">programming that&#39;s c going to c</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">plus plus right um basically and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">you can take it even further microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">created these things called</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">com objects and everything was going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">be an object</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">to pass around small talk has this kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">of paradigm also</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">but it turned out this didn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">improve programmer productivity</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">the thing that improved programmer</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">productivity was garbage collection</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">so when you think of a computer first i</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">mean we kind of have to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">what is a computer</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">you can think about it like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">processor that runs a stream of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">instructions</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">and then you have ram um</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">now you can break ram into two things</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">there&#39;s two things stored in ram there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">instructions</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s data so most computers</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">really don&#39;t treat these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">very differently when i</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">make a program like hello world</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">and i compile this we can take a look</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">in this program</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s not even all of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">yeah uh so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">this section here this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">ascii for hello world</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s in the same memory space</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">um as the instructions itself which does</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">printing of hello world here&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">function it&#39;s called a dialed stub</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">binder is actually what calls the printf</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">um so yeah what is a computer uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">processor and ram</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">um then you can break down</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">your program so when you have a program</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">a program has text it&#39;s called dot text</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">which is the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">a program has a stack program has a heap</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">and a program has bss</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">right so bss are things like um</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">static data uh there&#39;s a stack and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a heap</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">heaps you get to through malik stacks</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">you get to through</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">uh you know anything like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">this is a variable on the stack</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">local vars also control flows on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">stack</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">right if i have a main function and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">a what this does is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">pushes the return location</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">to the stack</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">so you know when i call b down here</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">um this at the end here is returned by</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">popping off</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">stack okay so this is a basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">what a computer is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">now there&#39;s a whole other direction you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">can go with the idea of what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">right there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">practical like i want to get a job</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">right um programming for work</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">uh maybe we&#39;ll make a note too we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">call programming for</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">so what does this mean what does a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">software engineer do</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">well they don&#39;t really write algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">um you will never in any job have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">write</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:49.519" style="s2">a sort algorithm a binary search</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.519" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">anything like that um so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">write algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">um what else well</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">very few people actually work on uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">there&#39;s some people who work on</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">infrastructure but that&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">most software engineers are basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">translators</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">right and they translate a language</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">uh maybe we&#39;ll call the language</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">business requirements</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">into code</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole lot of frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">which exist</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">to make writing things</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">that meet business requirements easier</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">if you think of a business requirement</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">like you know we need a web page that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">allow users to say leave a phone number</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">where we can call them back right</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of frameworks that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">designed to do things like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">if you wanted to write something on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">you could use something like ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">rails right</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s why uh i hate when</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">does that i don&#39;t actually know right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">for like you know uh web apps</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">um there&#39;s also this paradigm of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">crud apps and you get what crud stands</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">uh the four basic types of sql command</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">create read</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">update delete all right</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">uh so let&#39;s say we want to build</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">ruby on rails or similar um</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">for web apps and you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">creating an app that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">create read update delete there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">front end uh the view</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">there&#39;s some database which is the model</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">and then there is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">uh business logic</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">which is a controller</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">so let&#39;s say the front end is let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">back to that um</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">i want to build a portal</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">where my customers can uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">add their phone number such that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">be able to call them</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">they have to be able to update their</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">phone number due to gdpr</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">they have to be able to delete their</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">profile you can see how it translates to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">this right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">um so this isn&#39;t this is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">you you&#39;re not just the same way the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">word doctor means so many things a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">doctor is someone who diagnoses a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">someone who prescribes a doctor or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">someone who has bedside manner</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">um a software engineer</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s kind of misleading and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">like what you do in school if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">school and you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">um how to write binary search algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing like what you do in</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">practice what you do in practice is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">really you&#39;re translating</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">from a really shitty language um</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">into these things that are like code and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">i meet these people and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">you&#39;re going to learn</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">um what you will</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">learn in boot camps right</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.839" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">um so for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">no one who&#39;s ever gone to a boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">would ever give get a job at comma ai</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">because at comma you don&#39;t do this um</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">nothing at comma looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">this stupid paradigm and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">be replaced pretty soon by by ai&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">i think about writing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">like if you want to write the low brow</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">version of backspace</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">backspace is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">basically this i mean so here step one</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">a crud app</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">contracting firm</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">step two</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">record all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">inputs of my contract</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">developers i don&#39;t know just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">contract developers will make fun of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">someone full-time</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">uh developers uh train</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">ai model to translate</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">business logic into code</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">right translators</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">um so yeah if you guys are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">uh about a job like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">really trash work</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">uh you can get paid some amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">but your your your monks used to do this</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">monks used to like spend time copying</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">they&#39;d have to before they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">printing presses they&#39;d have to well</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">someone&#39;s got to copy the bible so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">that&#39;s practically what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not very um</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">you know it&#39;s kind of trash right uh so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">notice how none of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">go back to this guy here none of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">has anything to do with this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">completely separate things</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">a software engineer a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">people who i meet who are software</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">engineers</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">know basically nothing about computers</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">uh what they know about</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">is how to translate this shitty language</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">into code is almost giving it too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">um and then here so let&#39;s think of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">ruby uh react right</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">um think of all all the very heavy</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">it almost has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">programming and it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">memorizing weird syntax of of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">something uh stupid right um</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about things that are that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">are more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">all right so uh i come from uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">i learned this stuff from from my kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">of hacking background</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">um what is happening well so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">again programs have input</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">computation output</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">so if you want to attack the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll call this a system right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">if you want to say get like a uh you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">want to get like remote code execution</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">on the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">right the question you ask is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">input uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">to the system achieves</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">my uh desired</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">outcome okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">again a lot of hacking is because like</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">the system didn&#39;t think to check uh for</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">what it is i&#39;m sending it and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">get the system to behave in ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">that aren&#39;t uh within the normal bounds</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">of output</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">so if you think this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">function right um what are the words in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">function you have a domain</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">which is the input to a function</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">function range</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">or like you know y equals f of x right</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">so this is a this is a pure model</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">um but most computation is impure</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">uh when it&#39;s impure the function doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">necessarily have to output something in</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">the range it can do something entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">so yeah i mean what is what is hacking</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s figuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">out how uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">the function uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">you know figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">to make the function uh behave</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">how uh you want</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">um now you can use the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">paradigm to analyze almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">anything right input system output</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">say you want to uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">say you want to change your flight on</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">united and you don&#39;t want to pay change</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">fees</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">well you can think of the input is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">can i do well</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">i have a i can call i can call the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">united customer support line</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">um the system is the customer support</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">agent and the output</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">is them clicking a button on their</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">computer that says wave change fees</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">probably written in some cred app right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">so if you think about it like that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">think okay how do i get the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">what inputs well what do i have control</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">over i can make multiple calls</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">i can change the words that i say on</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">each call</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">you can do things that are completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">out of bounds of the system entirely you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">you know get the person&#39;s real name you</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">can dox them uh you can threaten them</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">you might go to jail for these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not advising you do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s all within this this</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">paradigm of input</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">system output and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">what is programming input computation</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">thank you for subscribing uh no no there</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to get big are we getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">people watching the stream</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">oh yeah okay now let&#39;s get viewers let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">get viewers</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">so when you ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">what is programming how do i get good at</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t understand what it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">any any website any boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">will teach you functioning crud app</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">um when it comes down to hacking every</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">system is different if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">good at hacking you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">this basic idea uh remember that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">one of the reasons i don&#39;t play ctfs</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">anymore is because it</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">became too um</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">boxed uh this is i feel similarly about</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">about competition programming</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">competition programming is not about who</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">can cleverly come up with new algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">you know pattern recognition okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">this is actually a a graph isomorphism</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">uh i can do graphite some isomorphism</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s np but oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">a a binary search over this and i can</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">sort the list</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">in n log n instead of n square and i can</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">solve it in time right</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">um yeah so cdfs are still fun</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">and ctf still like i think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">that kind of probably break the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">but a lot of it became the same tricks</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">over and over again and you just drilled</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">once you can drill it&#39;s no longer a test</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">of intelligence it&#39;s a test of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">you know are you willing to practice are</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">you willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">40 hours into a week into learning some</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">relatively useful skill</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">i shouldn&#39;t hate on ctfs and they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">great way to get into this stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">just a thing like like</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">back in the day ctfs didn&#39;t feel as much</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">like this but competition programming</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">already did</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">i have nothing but praise for the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">that i spent doing competition</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">and learning what there is to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">then realizing once you&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">be grinding it&#39;s time to stop</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">yeah uh hacking and coding is all about</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">learning and applying new skills so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">repetition runs counter to what it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">about okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">um so if you watch my stream two days</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">where i did the uh adding the for loops</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">to clang</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">that&#39;s another you can get paid a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">money if you can do this right</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">um this is kind of what my ethereum</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">contract was uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">understand so so maybe there&#39;s a like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">like like high brow software engineering</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">understand a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">modify the system to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">say add a feature</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">ship the new system</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">meaning like test well and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">time on</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s break that down using</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">the same sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">uh uh mentality right</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">so wasting time</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">uh so the girl last night on the date</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">told me a very she has a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">interesting life philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">um if you guys know the story about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">fox and sour grapes</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">the fox is out walking he sees a grape</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">vine and there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">juicy bundle of grapes uh sitting up</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">there he</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">puts his paws up on the fence and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">tries to reach it and he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">um he climbs the fence he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">climb the fence</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">but he cuts his paw and then he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">you know yeah okay those grapes are</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">probably sour anyway and he walks away</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">right um so this is the traditional sour</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">grape story</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">and usually people who have this you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">know those angry sort of people but</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">her take on it was when she cut her paw</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">it must have been a divine sign from god</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">that the grapes were probably poisonous</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like a positive spin to the sour</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">grape story</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know um</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">you know if you go through life</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">everything that you don&#39;t get you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">realize that you didn&#39;t want it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">and like you really you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">put a positive spin on that this is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">is an impenetrable fortress of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">uh psychological i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">um wasting time i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">right all right so this gets into like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">like uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">existentialism right the basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">is uh you make your own</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">uh meaning all right sorry</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">now you asked if this is all</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">existentialism is how did people write</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">really long books about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">and you&#39;ll have to ask those people but</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">um my personal philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">is that there&#39;s no such thing as wasting</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">like it&#39;s a stupid a time is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">wasting time is great</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">this is the point of time to waste it um</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">you know maybe maybe i&#39;ll add a caveat</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">don&#39;t fall uh in funnels right</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">um if you are in other people&#39;s funnels</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">um don&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">skinner boxes</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">skinner boxes all right</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">maybe uh um don&#39;t fall in funnels</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">don&#39;t be in skinner boxes and don&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">be influenced</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">by advertising</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">can i explain algorithmic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">sure um</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">again let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s see if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">good content on this already</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">before i do it uh what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">algorithmic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">algorithmic complexity is a measure of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">how long an algorithm would take to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">complete given input of size n if an</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">algorithm has to scale it should compute</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">the result with a finite and practical</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">time bound even for large values of n</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">for this reason complexity is calculated</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">asymptotically as n approaches infinity</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what big o notation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">well complexity is usually in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">um so this is a way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">ah how many</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">operations does it take for an input of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">size n</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">right so you can take sorting algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">sorting is usually a good way</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">to think about complexity um</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">so you can take like a bubble sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">algorithm right uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">bubble sort in pseudocode is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">uh something along the lines of for i in</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">uh one to n uh for j</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">in uh i to n</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">uh or let&#39;s say i plus one to n if j</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">is less than i swap</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">ah</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">all right um so</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">this algorithm is o of n squared</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">because you see this loop start from</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">zero i&#39;m not writing lua or nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">um so this loop is n this loop you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">be like well no the average is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">n over two but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">n times n over two is is is uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s still o of n squared right so this</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">is an o of n squared sorting algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">so you can take other sorting algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">other sorting algorithms basically have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">this idea of we&#39;re going to build up a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">so say i want to sort the list you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">three five</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">four six right um we take a tree</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">we put seven on the top branch right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">now we say three is three</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">uh less than or equal to seven</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s less than so we&#39;ll put it on</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">this side of the tree okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">and now we do the same thing with four</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">so we say well okay let&#39;s take four four</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">less than or equal to seven it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">than seven less than or equal</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">to three it&#39;s it&#39;s greater than three so</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">it goes here right</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.079" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">um six we have the same kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">this turned out to not work too well uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">because the height of this tree is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.839" style="s2">n but let&#39;s say i added something like</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">10 in you know 10 would go here in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.839" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">and make my tree too nice uh let&#39;s say i</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">added a five</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">in right the five would go here in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">tree and the size of this tree</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">the height of this tree uh is login</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">right um so that&#39;s all the sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">algorithms that are in n log n time</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">uh basically have some variant of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">right so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s n</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">inserts into</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">a login sized tree</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">so there are actually sorting algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">that run</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">in o n</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">ah so we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say the list that i&#39;m sorting is</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">um is guaranteed to only be numbers</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">between one and one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">so i can create a maybe something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">hash sort or something</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know what the name of it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">but oh then sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">so i can create an array like count</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">sub 100 for</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">i and 0 to n count sub arr</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">sub i</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">plus equals one</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">right and then i can loop through count</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">and then i say uh for</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">well you know just like print um</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">you want to print out basically the like</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">like the number</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">uh count number of times</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">right um so you see how this is of m</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">i have one loop going to n and then i</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">have one loop going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">to to count which can be viewed as like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">as like a k and k is small uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">but this obviously only works if your</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">your total number here</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">is small uh because the k</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">if these biggest element in the array</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">were to grow um</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">with the length of the array then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">sort would not be o of n but assuming</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">that it stays at 100</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">uh this sword is always of n but usually</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">the smallest sort is ammon</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">i think maybe that explains it better</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">than this</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">no we&#39;re not solving any leap codes</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">i&#39;d like to see you improve and open</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">source system that you&#39;d like to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">improve and follow along as you help</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.839" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">progressing</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">issues and features people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">learn they want to have your skills yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">they can get</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">can i explain binary search time</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">complexity sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">so binary search</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">find an element in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">a sorted list</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">something i say is hacking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">times is uh is just binary search by</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">right um so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">let&#39;s say let&#39;s say you have an oracle</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">or or you know we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll just do</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">it straight up right uh so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">sorted list right</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.839" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">all right let&#39;s say i want to find 67</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">so b search 67.</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">so you start out with defining a uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">a a a low and a high uh so we&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">the low</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">uh the beginning of the array and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">the length of the array</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">so i now take the midpoint</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">let&#39;s say i look at the array array</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">submit is 22.</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">now i know that it can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">be any of these right so here&#39;s my pivot</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">i say it can&#39;t possibly be any of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">because 67 is greater than 22</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">so we can now say low equals mid</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">so now i&#39;m just looking at this array</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first run of binary search</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">so again low zero highest length of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">array</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">mid low plus high equals two let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">mid is one uh so we get 45</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">low equals mid all right so now now</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it again</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">uh for this uh and this time mid</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">is 67 all right run it through so we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">return that we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">figure out what the index uh in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">original array was right</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">um so notice that this took three steps</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">which is significantly less than here n</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">equals 7 because 7 is the length of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">array so binary search runs an o of log</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">n time</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">again you can think about it similar to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">the tree where you&#39;re only walking down</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">one path</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">instead let&#39;s say instead of this sorted</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">list being put contiguously</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a tree how many jumps you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">to have to take in the tree it&#39;s login</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">what paper can implement beginner ml</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">engineer well i mean that&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">what paper can implement a beginning ml</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">engineer</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">oh i don&#39;t know about that uh yeah data</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">science is largely bs</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s teaching you if you&#39;re ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">like an object level skill you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">probably not learning the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">object level skills will die out when</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">the tools die out</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">but if you&#39;re learning kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">meta-level skills</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">then they&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like truth about the world right um</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">are you learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">something from nature or are you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">learning something from people</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re learning something from nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">good uh if you&#39;re learning something</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">from people</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">bad right um so you can you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">pretty much everything down into into</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">this paradigm if you&#39;re learning like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">physics comes from nature learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">physics is good if you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">celebrity gossip this is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">arbitrary about people it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">so you know one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">founding themes for the college</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">uh so we reject</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">uh power over people</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">um and this will actually make us</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">ignored by the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">a system cares</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">deeply about power</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">over people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">embrace power over nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">so yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">and then like like like okay so like</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">answering a question what is data</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">science right</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">um if data science if data science means</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">statistics sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">if data science means like um tooling</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">i gotta do complex numbers too i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">really know</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">um we want to learn how to learn</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">efficiently learning</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">strategies i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">helm.ai is four years behind</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">some of these questions like what books</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">do you recommend how to stay hungry</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">um elon talks about this a lot right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">you want to build a uh a knowledge tree</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">i build a knowledge tree and that means</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">that whenever you learn</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">new information fits into the trade</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">people who i&#39;ve met who know</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">a lot of things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">not even always that they know um maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">interpolation</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">note of a tree if you have some nodes</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">nearby you can kind of interpolate to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">understanding um</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">you can you can root this knowledge tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">so elon talks about it elon roots</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">knowledge tree in physics</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">i root knowledge tree in information</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">all right so my whole input computation</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">is this this idea of um</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">information this is a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">perspective post-modernist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.000" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">all right um but but</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">both of those things are are very very</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">good ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">uh so so i mean how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">explain uh anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">i mean you know i some of these were</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">like how to get a girlfriend right</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">input system output this is my core</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">paradigm for understanding anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">this is what richard hamming was</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">promoted a lot that&#39;s that&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">like a hamming tree guy</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">coding theory was one of the classes i</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">took that i couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">it was too hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">um i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">so bezos um</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">bezos basically uses this this this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:42.990" style="s2">trick</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:46.110" style="s2">um bazel&#39;s operations mastermind right</p>

<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">so for example um amazon ships many</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.920" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">packages</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">uh when amazon negotiates with ups</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">uh bezos has his guys draw up</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">a amazon shipping plan right</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">the plan is uh let&#39;s say sales pitch</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">uh to ups ups</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">um you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">gives real rate right great</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">pezos wins</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that is the amazon</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">trick over and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">uh oh post-structuralism see i like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">weird things like this</p>

<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">structuralism proposes that one may</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">understand human culture by means of a</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">understanding differs</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">from concrete reality and abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">ideas instead as a third order that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">mediates between the two</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2">yeah and then what&#39;s downstream of all</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">shaped by programmers doing the grunt</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">work and a lot more shaped by who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">telling the best stories</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:20.400" style="s2">so you know if you want to save the</p>

<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:58.400" style="s2">chemists want to be physicists</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.359" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">while physicists want to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.400" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">mathematicians all mathematicians want</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">to be philosophers and all philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">want to be employed</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.839" end="01:04:16.640" style="s2">um programmers are</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.280" end="01:04:19.680" style="s2">are translators yeah uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">right this is this is what most</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">software engineers do all day</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">um go learn your stupid frameworks right</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">but again that&#39;s the my</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:29.599" style="s2">same thing about about data science</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:32.799" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:36.480" style="s2">you know tooling that</p>

<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:52.400" style="s2">because the</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">have to think about recursion just as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">stack</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">all right swat on my house oh no this</p>

<p begin="01:08:46.319" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">it will just become</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.000" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">current development will become the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:55.120" style="s2">lowest common denominator</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">ai you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.120" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">who&#39;s that guy in office space he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">well i take the thing from the engineers</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">and i give it to the i talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">customer and i give it to the engineers</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">that&#39;s all it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">um constructivist mathematics uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m yeah of course</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">uh so my understanding of constructivism</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">uh says that you can&#39;t the law of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">excluded middle doesn&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">uh so you can&#39;t just make an assumption</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">find a contradiction and say therefore</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">the assumption is true</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">uh you wouldn&#39;t this is why i really</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">like things like which</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">like so they have a constructivist</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">which um</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">it says if you want to say something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.480" end="01:09:45.759" style="s2">true you can&#39;t just say you can&#39;t just</p>

<p begin="01:14:41.360" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">have we proven that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.679" end="01:14:51.840" style="s2">oh some digit occurs okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.159" end="01:14:57.199" style="s2">perhaps you think of the statement that</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.520" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">every digit occurs infinitely often</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.199" end="01:15:02.080" style="s2">which is probably open</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">yeah um but some digit occurs infinitely</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.080" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">uh i mean yeah okay you&#39;re right so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.159" end="01:15:11.199" style="s2">obvious proof there is</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:12.800" style="s2">assume for the sake of contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.199" end="01:15:15.920" style="s2">that no digits occur</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.800" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">infinitely often then given that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.080" end="01:15:23.679" style="s2">uh by the pigeonhole principle</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:26.000" style="s2">pi is not a transcendent number but we</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.679" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">know pi is a transcendent number</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.000" end="01:15:33.280" style="s2">uh therefore contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:33.280" style="s2">uh qed um</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.239" end="01:15:43.040" style="s2">this is another classic one yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:43.040" style="s2">i mean but i&#39;m sure you can prove that</p>

<p begin="01:17:05.040" end="01:17:10.400" style="s2">okay theorem is that it&#39;s integral</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">if rational so meaning it&#39;s an integer</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.400" end="01:17:16.960" style="s2">if it&#39;s if it&#39;s rational</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:20.320" style="s2">uh the proof</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.960" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a reduced fraction so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.320" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">greatest common divisor is one</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">uh that&#39;s using like the extended</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:47.520" style="s2">yeah that works sure</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.840" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">yeah there you go it&#39;s so much better</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.960" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s so much better than the other proof</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.800" end="01:18:15.520" style="s2">oh browering can are examples let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.679" end="01:18:18.239" style="s2">i think that all of higher education</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.520" end="01:18:20.000" style="s2">today is whatever the opposite of based</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">is you know maybe cupped</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.000" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">uh that&#39;s kind of a problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.920" end="01:18:35.679" style="s2">like there&#39;s probably small numbers of</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.560" end="01:19:12.719" style="s2">there uh put it this way administrative</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.880" end="01:19:14.239" style="s2">spending comprised just 26 percent of</p>

<p begin="01:19:20.840" end="01:19:23.840" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">wait huh where&#39;d the other spending go</p>

<p begin="01:19:36.800" end="01:19:40.480" style="s2">maybe this isn&#39;t true i&#39;m not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.159" style="s2">that interested in looking into the case</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.480" end="01:19:43.600" style="s2">uh i mean i witnessed this firsthand</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.159" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.600" end="01:19:51.040" style="s2">from speaking with a lot of people uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">just how</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.040" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">this is what i mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:10.400" style="s2">uh that&#39;s that&#39;s not what i was thinking</p>

<p begin="01:20:10.400" end="01:20:12.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.239" end="01:20:20.320" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not i&#39;m not i&#39;m not hopeful for</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.719" end="01:20:23.760" style="s2">the future of the the higher education</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.760" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">uh curtis describes it as a state church</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.520" end="01:20:34.159" style="s2">where do i expect newer generations to</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.040" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">learn things like lower level</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.159" end="01:20:40.159" style="s2">programming or theory the same place</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">everyone else did what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.159" end="01:20:43.040" style="s2">people always say this people say this</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:44.000" style="s2">about computer science man the kids</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:45.679" style="s2">aren&#39;t really going to learn how</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.000" end="01:20:47.280" style="s2">computers work</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.679" end="01:20:50.159" style="s2">why because our math majors don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.280" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">how arithmetic works</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.159" end="01:20:53.520" style="s2">like that&#39;s just a sign that someone was</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.760" end="01:20:55.199" style="s2">poorly educated</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:57.360" style="s2">not it&#39;s not going to like fade from the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.199" end="01:20:58.880" style="s2">world people say this but</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">you know there&#39;s been so many other</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.880" end="01:21:01.440" style="s2">disciplines and i have no idea why they</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.440" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">computer science is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.159" end="01:21:11.760" style="s2">look up the journal constructive</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.840" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">approximation</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to learn guys</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.560" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t really know what approximations</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:34.159" style="s2">and expansions</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:34.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:45.120" style="s2">by the way oh i mean unfortunately it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.760" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">a web archive but can we look at how</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.120" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">nice this web page is</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.159" end="01:21:56.239" style="s2">someone criticized my uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.000" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">use of like looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.239" end="01:21:59.920" style="s2">sh the form and not the content but the</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:02.880" style="s2">form is an</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.920" end="01:22:04.239" style="s2">incredibly good predictor of content a</p>

<p begin="01:22:04.239" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">contains truths because there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.480" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">reason for someone to build it</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.600" end="01:22:20.400" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s been taken offline</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.920" end="01:22:20.400" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.320" end="01:22:26.800" style="s2">a website like this probably contains</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:30.960" style="s2">way less truths</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.800" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">right compare the websites</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.960" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">so now we see what&#39;s wrong with uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.840" end="01:22:42.000" style="s2">colleges</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.719" end="01:22:43.920" style="s2">i promise our university</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.000" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">will have a website that looks much more</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.920" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">like this and much less like this</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.679" end="01:22:55.040" style="s2">computer architecture or quantitative</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.840" end="01:22:58.639" style="s2">approach let&#39;s see what we got</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.040" end="01:22:58.639" style="s2">college is a funnel society&#39;s a funnel</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.840" end="01:23:10.320" style="s2">man</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.600" end="01:23:54.159" style="s2">version i i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.679" end="01:23:56.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t think anywhere ah take a look</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.159" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">inside oh cool</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.560" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">see what we got</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:14.840" style="s2">i mean this is yeah if you want to study</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.679" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">computer architecture that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.840" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">decent</p>

<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">watch you rant about how</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.120" end="01:26:18.800" style="s2">you they shouldn&#39;t need to watch people</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:20.239" style="s2">like you rant</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.800" end="01:26:22.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know we&#39;re just hanging out and</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.239" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">like thinking i&#39;m gonna go back to</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.480" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">reading in a bit</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.840" end="01:26:29.760" style="s2">i try my ideas out on twitch right i</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.239" end="01:26:30.880" style="s2">tried hammer out and decided there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.760" end="01:26:34.000" style="s2">never gonna be a hammer</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.880" end="01:26:35.840" style="s2"> hammer um i tried backspace out</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.000" end="01:26:37.199" style="s2">and it got a pretty good response on</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.840" end="01:26:38.719" style="s2">twitch um</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.199" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">the problems with backspace are more</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.719" end="01:26:42.560" style="s2">technical and actually comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.239" end="01:26:45.040" style="s2">more the question of what is programming</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:46.400" style="s2">right i don&#39;t want to make if you want</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.040" end="01:26:49.040" style="s2">to do programming for work if you want</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.400" end="01:26:50.239" style="s2">to make crud apps like</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.040" end="01:26:52.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not really what i want to do in</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.239" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">backspace</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.080" end="01:26:59.040" style="s2">um i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:27:02.400" style="s2">the problem i ran into with backspace</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.040" end="01:27:06.480" style="s2">is like um is</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.400" end="01:27:06.480" style="s2">our modern programming languages</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.280" end="01:27:17.360" style="s2">already the best way</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.800" end="01:27:17.360" style="s2">to describe what you want</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.520" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">how yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.679" end="01:27:42.639" style="s2">like yeah what is it is programming</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.840" end="01:27:45.120" style="s2">really just describing</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.639" end="01:27:46.000" style="s2">is is there a more concise language</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.120" end="01:27:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a better way</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.000" end="01:27:53.760" style="s2">to is does there</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.840" end="01:27:56.880" style="s2">exist a more concise</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.760" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">programming language</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.880" end="01:28:04.800" style="s2">um aka</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:08.159" style="s2">uh what is the next</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.800" end="01:28:08.159" style="s2">gc right</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.639" end="01:28:13.360" style="s2">object-oriented programming didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:15.040" style="s2">deliver the improvements garbage</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.360" end="01:28:16.960" style="s2">collection did</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.040" end="01:28:18.480" style="s2">uh not having to deal with freeing your</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.960" end="01:28:22.080" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.480" end="01:28:24.560" style="s2">um i mean so so</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.080" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">my basic thesis is like uh compilers</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.560" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">should do more search</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:40.880" style="s2">gc is garbage collection uh so if i</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.040" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">write some</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.880" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">if i write some c code</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.520" end="01:28:57.840" style="s2">let&#39;s make a function</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.040" end="01:29:53.840" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s all well and good</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:55.760" style="s2">except for this fact</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.840" end="01:29:57.120" style="s2">see look at a dot out&#39;s memory usage</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.760" end="01:29:58.639" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.120" end="01:30:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s memory usage is growing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.639" end="01:30:03.520" style="s2">going to have to kill it before it keeps</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.000" end="01:30:03.520" style="s2">using more because there&#39;s a memory leak</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.600" end="01:30:07.679" style="s2">because what happens in this program is</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.000" end="01:30:09.360" style="s2">every time a is called</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.679" end="01:30:10.719" style="s2">i&#39;m malicking six bytes of memory i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.360" end="01:30:13.199" style="s2">taking six bytes</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.719" end="01:30:14.719" style="s2">off the heap and even though once this</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.199" end="01:30:17.199" style="s2">while loop comes around again those</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.719" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">bytes are never accessible</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.199" end="01:30:23.120" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:24.560" style="s2">the compiler the program&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.120" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">allocated them so you know to fix this</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.560" end="01:30:27.760" style="s2">bug</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:27.760" style="s2">i can do that</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.800" end="01:30:32.719" style="s2">and now we&#39;ll see that a dot out does</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.120" end="01:30:36.320" style="s2">not increase in memory usage</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.719" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">right so a gc would automatically find</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.320" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">unreachable pointers and free them</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.199" end="01:30:51.679" style="s2">yeah so rust has a separate idea russ</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.239" end="01:30:54.560" style="s2">has this idea of of uh of ownership</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.679" end="01:30:55.600" style="s2">um but it makes rust very very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.560" end="01:30:57.840" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.600" end="01:30:59.679" style="s2">the the beauty of gcs is that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.840" end="01:31:01.520" style="s2">operate completely in the background and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.679" end="01:31:02.320" style="s2">it would make this a valid program to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.520" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.320" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">i could write this in go and go as a gc</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.560" end="01:31:11.760" style="s2">if you can find the shortest program</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.600" end="01:31:13.760" style="s2">that outputs the data yeah sure um i</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.760" end="01:31:15.440" style="s2">shall for the hudder prize a lot</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.760" end="01:31:16.800" style="s2">make it subscribers only you never see</p>

<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:24.480" style="s2">is like think about what the structure</p>

<p begin="01:34:42.000" end="01:34:44.960" style="s2">is is what you&#39;re looking for there and</p>

<p begin="01:35:06.480" end="01:35:10.400" style="s2">so think about in some ways there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.880" end="01:35:12.639" style="s2">hierarchy right um</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.400" end="01:35:14.639" style="s2">oh that&#39;s all right let me see if i can</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.639" end="01:35:17.440" style="s2">find i wish i had a nice way to index</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.639" end="01:35:17.440" style="s2">this book better</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.239" end="01:35:20.480" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="01:36:32.719" end="01:36:35.600" style="s2">is actually that they don&#39;t control the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.239" end="01:36:38.080" style="s2">narrative anymore</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.600" end="01:36:40.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the new narratives are any</p>
