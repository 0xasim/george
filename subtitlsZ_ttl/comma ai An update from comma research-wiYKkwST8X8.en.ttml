<p begin="00:01:01.870" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">right so the three announcements don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.610" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">read the board know like them so how</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.869" end="00:01:21.850" style="s2">three things</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:25.030" style="s2">waha beitia say Babesia it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.850" end="00:01:26.800" style="s2">goatee or something all right so three</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.030" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">things that come on research is active</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.800" end="00:01:34.090" style="s2">so coma research is not to desert it we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:38.830" style="s2">make projects so it&#39;s R squared the dill</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.090" end="00:01:40.179" style="s2">and the 888 project so this is for you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.830" end="00:01:42.429" style="s2">guys to understand what we will be doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.179" end="00:01:44.050" style="s2">right because we announced the coma</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.429" end="00:01:45.100" style="s2">research but now we have to know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.050" end="00:01:46.869" style="s2">come on research is going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.100" end="00:01:48.130" style="s2">and how is it different from call</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.869" end="00:01:50.170" style="s2">product is it different</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.130" end="00:01:51.369" style="s2">so the question because the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.170" end="00:01:52.869" style="s2">that we want to make sure is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.369" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">research and coma</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.869" end="00:01:58.450" style="s2">oh I all the research in other places</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:02:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not a scam right usual research is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.450" end="00:02:05.050" style="s2">just this multi-level marketing campaign</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.800" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">where you just like the research publish</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.050" end="00:02:08.170" style="s2">papers go to go first so you can hire</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:09.819" style="s2">more researchers and your company can</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.170" end="00:02:12.069" style="s2">look all right until you hire real</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.819" end="00:02:14.349" style="s2">workers that do all the job mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.069" end="00:02:16.300" style="s2">common research is different by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.349" end="00:02:20.050" style="s2">that the research also makes real things</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.300" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">here on this R square we will be doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.050" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">are you breaking common research yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">people are saying where&#39;s the stream at</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">it what&#39;s happening are we not live</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">for the driving intermediate layer or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.910" end="00:04:09.870" style="s2">language or language it&#39;s what guys so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:11.910" style="s2">you have to understand this because this</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">is what is a second driving car right a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">self-driving car is a three pieces piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">of technology right it&#39;s that humor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:31.820" style="s2">the car itself and it&#39;s the AI and each</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">one of them speaks a different language</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.820" end="00:04:36.539" style="s2">the human doesn&#39;t think of like how much</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.620" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">accelerate how much I want to steer now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.539" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">the human nose I want to get there this</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:43.710" style="s2">fast right and you a car</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:45.539" style="s2">is this mechanical thing that is done</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.710" end="00:04:47.729" style="s2">and then there&#39;s daily act which is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.539" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">software each one of them speaks</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.729" end="00:04:50.879" style="s2">different language and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:54.559" style="s2">bunch of blue code that communicates</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.879" end="00:05:04.469" style="s2">them the dill is here to solve that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.559" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">language between the car and the AI and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.469" end="00:05:16.349" style="s2">we have a lived some weeks weekend</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:19.339" style="s2">little bit I know but it my phone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.349" end="00:05:19.339" style="s2">accidentally went quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.599" end="00:05:27.659" style="s2">okay well show you someone wait ready</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.439" end="00:05:30.300" style="s2">dopey boom oh this is the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.659" end="00:05:33.569" style="s2">debug so this is the dill right here</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.300" end="00:05:35.610" style="s2">mm-hmm this is kind of what we expect to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.569" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">be the common language between the car</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.610" end="00:05:41.939" style="s2">and the AI so it just goes through like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">where the lanes the red shows you where</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.939" end="00:05:45.330" style="s2">the driving limit is so you clearly</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:47.460" style="s2">don&#39;t want to drive in the trees so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.330" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">that&#39;s where the the red lines separates</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.460" end="00:05:52.259" style="s2">that when the orange is the lanes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.740" end="00:05:54.149" style="s2">lane markings and then the yellow is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.259" end="00:05:58.050" style="s2">where the other cars are from the radar</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.149" end="00:06:00.659" style="s2">so the idea is that we can make a model</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.050" end="00:06:02.339" style="s2">that will be able to you know generate</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.659" end="00:06:04.229" style="s2">these types of this type of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.339" end="00:06:05.969" style="s2">representation of the world as you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.229" end="00:06:08.550" style="s2">see on the right and that should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.969" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">enough to be able to control the car yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:14.759" style="s2">and navigate yeah you look at that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.289" style="s2">know exactly where your room is so does</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.759" end="00:06:20.099" style="s2">the AI so that&#39;s a car</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.289" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">we are leaking secrets mostly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.099" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">enough that&#39;s enough you&#39;re right you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:27.899" style="s2">don&#39;t want to look too much into</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">surprises yeah yeah okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.899" end="00:06:31.589" style="s2">deal guys that this is the common</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:33.330" style="s2">language so and here here goes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.589" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">question why do you want to build this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.330" end="00:06:37.229" style="s2">unified language right so if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:38.909" style="s2">person and you understand where a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.229" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">self-driving car is doing so it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.909" end="00:06:44.309" style="s2">safe if you are a customer electronic</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:47.069" style="s2">company like Samsung wherever or</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.309" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">something and you want your copper your</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.069" end="00:06:50.339" style="s2">devices student look understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:06:52.199" style="s2">self-driving cars to understand right</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.339" end="00:06:54.209" style="s2">now well you can drive the car you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.199" end="00:06:54.860" style="s2">to spit the deal and if you are an OPM</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.209" end="00:06:56.870" style="s2">if you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.860" end="00:06:58.129" style="s2">car company and you want your car to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.870" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">interface with this common language</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">also goes into the HD maps and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:44.740" style="s2">into they attain a project and if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:47.980" style="s2">want to make sure by the way EDA is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.740" end="00:09:51.340" style="s2">about open source data right and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.980" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">HD maps here&#39;s one thing about beauty</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.340" end="00:09:55.030" style="s2">hmm what&#39;s the point of working out by</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.410" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">the way huh what&#39;s the point of radar</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.030" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">now what is the point of razor 7s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:03.190" style="s2">is the point of radar well radar and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:06.280" style="s2">things like radar and radar can help us</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.190" end="00:10:08.740" style="s2">know how our crazy are so we know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.280" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">we heard at least just as good as them</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">and later we are better than them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:12.700" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">so you know you finish your presentation</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.700" end="00:10:17.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll take questions at the end that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:20.770" style="s2">okay yeah so here&#39;s one thing here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.710" end="00:10:23.370" style="s2">thing the alien a project is about</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.770" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">releasing data right data for HD maps</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.370" end="00:10:30.100" style="s2">data for HD maps is about knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.860" end="00:10:31.570" style="s2">distance between objects in the camera</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.100" end="00:10:34.060" style="s2">and also knowing the distance between</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.570" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">two views of the road so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.060" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2">something like this like these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:43.450" style="s2">different routes on that people driving</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:44.590" style="s2">the car they are open pilot in different</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.450" end="00:10:46.840" style="s2">days right</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.590" end="00:10:48.670" style="s2">and then we know how close those images</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.840" end="00:10:50.440" style="s2">are and then we try to match them how</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.670" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">far away is this camera from this camera</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.440" end="00:10:55.390" style="s2">to this camera here&#39;s one thing if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:10:57.910" style="s2">guys want to make sure you&#39;re part of</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.910" end="00:11:02.460" style="s2">called common raid which is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.690" end="00:11:05.950" style="s2">several okoma</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.310" style="s2">it out a way to do it without this but</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:20.770" style="s2">if you want to make sure your data goes</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.310" end="00:11:22.930" style="s2">into the ADA a project you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.770" end="00:11:24.610" style="s2">your buddies in your common meetups and</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.940" end="00:16:31.790" style="s2">we do a lot of the key before the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.340" end="00:16:31.790" style="s2">the years</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:39.080" style="s2">yes you a little death are estimated</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.650" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">from cam yeah yeah okay so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.080" end="00:17:41.510" style="s2">understand how to transform one</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:43.610" style="s2">dimension to the other when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.510" end="00:17:45.620" style="s2">driving your car or when you have you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.610" end="00:17:48.200" style="s2">and your board is on a common raid we</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.620" end="00:17:50.150" style="s2">ask the software how to just one one</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.200" end="00:17:52.669" style="s2">image into the other so the way it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.150" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">is it predicts how far away each pixel</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.669" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">is from the camera so it projects all</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">this pixels in 3d and then he estimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">the distance between the two cameras and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:03.950" style="s2">then regenerate the the new image from</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:06.980" style="s2">the new point of view then it compares</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.950" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">to the to the second pair of image so a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.980" end="00:18:10.610" style="s2">useful metric</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:12.860" style="s2">why not using dual camera we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.610" end="00:18:16.600" style="s2">using it ever yeah that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.860" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">doing it so we&#39;re looking at into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.600" end="00:18:21.770" style="s2">duo</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">technology but but when you have when</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.770" end="00:18:25.700" style="s2">you drive several times over the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:30.919" style="s2">Road that&#39;s the same you dual cameras</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.700" end="00:18:32.690" style="s2">right by the price of one so yeah whoa</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.919" end="00:18:34.610" style="s2">came our technology but if they only</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.690" end="00:18:37.700" style="s2">wants can we use more cars with schipper</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.610" end="00:18:39.340" style="s2">plus with grey or similar can we use Y</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.700" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">it more cars that are not exact</p>
