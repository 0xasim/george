<p begin="00:07:16.430" end="00:07:20.930" style="s2">simulation with the github Oh failure</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.650" end="00:07:22.520" style="s2">pedal hardware um so if it truly</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.930" end="00:07:25.580" style="s2">catastrophic lis fails then you will</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.520" end="00:07:27.949" style="s2">just lose acceleration on your car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:29.539" style="s2">pretty safe basically yeah your car</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.949" end="00:07:32.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t accelerate put your hands on</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.539" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">pull to the side of the road yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.900" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">what&#39;s that is that is that Q is that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:46.219" style="s2">well if you lose if you lose</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">acceleration yeah it&#39;s QM yeah yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.219" end="00:07:50.630" style="s2">here with Ricardo new calibration not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:51.699" style="s2">coming with HDR though new calibration</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.630" end="00:07:53.659" style="s2">is in progress</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.699" end="00:07:59.330" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually done calibration</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.659" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">correctly now wait no no you want to put</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.330" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">this one into the top yeah the one that</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">fix the slow acceleration on the Civic</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.539" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">can we fix that software yeah we gotta</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">fix that the software I complained about</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:24.159" style="s2">it - it was bad anyone who reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:27.500" style="s2">will Phelps is bad calibration soon TM</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.159" end="00:08:31.069" style="s2">eventually TM is like never soon TM as</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.500" end="00:08:33.079" style="s2">is maybe yeah I got an already on what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.069" end="00:08:35.690" style="s2">is on pilot getting HDR after after</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">do the Toyotas with hacking because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.110" end="00:08:48.590" style="s2">Toyotas don&#39;t really separate the gas in</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">the brake you just feed them</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.590" end="00:08:56.420" style="s2">acceleration is that true yes yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:58.580" style="s2">like I mean like on a Prius how much</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.420" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">sense does it really make to like Jack</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.580" end="00:09:03.260" style="s2">the pedal and you don&#39;t want the pedal</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:05.180" style="s2">you want acceleration control shiver&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.260" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">plus usage versus open pilot usage</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.180" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a very secret number very secret</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.400" end="00:09:17.330" style="s2">we&#39;re doing we don&#39;t have for</p>
