<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">safety</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.899" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">um so you know there were two uh two</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">crashes recently there was the uber</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">crash and the Tesla crash you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">sometime they like to call them</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">accidents and they are accidents but you</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">know crash is a more descriptive of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">actually happened um so first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">haven&#39;t really said anything about them</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">until now I wouldn&#39;t go that far</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I wouldn&#39;t go far enough to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">say that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">Uber&#39;s fault I think actually most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">the blame in the situation lies on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">safety driver remember guys there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">such thing as level four self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">cars there are no self-driving cars that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">can drive better than people some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:49.700" style="s2">these driver assistance systems when</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">used in conjunction with the person nope</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.700" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">so open pilot is not anywhere near a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:01.250" style="s2">level four self-driving car and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">everybody who uses it should know this I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.250" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">question I question uh if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">this I question a lot um so it was it oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">burrs fault I wouldn&#39;t blame the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">engineers</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:18.140" style="s2">Uber&#39;s fault invaded a vetting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">monitoring their safety drivers I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.140" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2">say some of the blame lies there I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.100" style="s2">say most of the blame lives with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">safety driver themselves not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.100" end="00:02:33.320" style="s2">the road and you know the person I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:37.340" style="s2">don&#39;t blame the victim but she wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.320" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">being very careful so what&#39;s the take</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.340" end="00:02:42.770" style="s2">away what&#39;s the take away so who&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">a a Tesla crash if you guys saw the test</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.770" end="00:02:48.830" style="s2">the crash that hit the the concrete</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">barrier model acts totally burnt out in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.830" end="00:02:57.110" style="s2">the front so Tesla released a blog post</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:02:59.030" style="s2">and then a follow-up blog post turns out</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">the car was on autopilot and there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.030" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">no hardly anyone could get there open</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">pilot working with their cars to come a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.959" style="s2">wholly fine I mean to be honest so when</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:17.060" style="s2">you look at Tesla&#39;s statistics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.959" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty fair I mean look to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.060" end="00:03:20.390" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">prevents all accidents is ridiculous the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.390" end="00:03:26.360" style="s2">goal is to make things safer and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:28.250" style="s2">know Tesla obviously interprets the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.360" end="00:03:30.070" style="s2">statistics in a favorable light but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re very far off from</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.070" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">uber statistics on the other hand do not</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.510" style="s2">look good</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:40.070" style="s2">we have a fatality on the roads I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.510" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">believe Tesla said every eighty eight</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.070" end="00:03:43.070" style="s2">million miles will usually go with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:50.620" style="s2">number about one in every hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.070" end="00:03:53.299" style="s2">million and yeah Ober had only driven a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.620" end="00:03:55.940" style="s2">couple million miles so that was that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.299" end="00:03:58.630" style="s2">was probably far too soon there was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.940" end="00:04:03.270" style="s2">interesting article that came</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.630" end="00:04:06.040" style="s2">a computer segment of no I know no I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.270" end="00:04:08.140" style="s2">where you guys post the memes and I lead</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:10.210" style="s2">them um this is an interesting article</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.140" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">former uber backup driver we saw this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.210" end="00:04:14.260" style="s2">coming I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a clickbait but</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:23.489" style="s2">um it actually the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.260" end="00:04:23.489" style="s2">thing I found in this article was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">you know this was one of our biggest</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.610" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">rules no phone in the left seat you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.230" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to after we&#39;ll get to we get</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:46.360" style="s2">to shit-talking Scobie Sunday in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.230" end="00:04:48.460" style="s2">um so look at this so far roughly a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.360" end="00:04:50.170" style="s2">dozen operators have been fired for</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.460" end="00:04:51.880" style="s2">using cell phones on their job and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.170" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">absolutely should be they absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.880" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">should be honestly if I was in if I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:56.740" style="s2">Anna nuber and the uber driver was using</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">their cell phone in a way that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.740" end="00:05:00.790" style="s2">was kind of unsafe like looking down for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.510" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">five seconds I can say something I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.790" end="00:05:06.040" style="s2">certainly give them a bad rating so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">guys don&#39;t don&#39;t use your phone and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.040" end="00:05:13.780" style="s2">drive but the bigger problem is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">this when you guys drive with open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.780" end="00:05:16.540" style="s2">one of the things that I think makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:17.920" style="s2">open pilot a bit a bit safer than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.540" end="00:05:20.380" style="s2">uber thing is you guys aren&#39;t driving</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.920" end="00:05:21.760" style="s2">for 12 hours straight knowing these</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.380" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">people who were probably pissed an hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.760" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">early and they probably drive constantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:31.630" style="s2">for 12 hours or eight hours or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">you get tired um but I do think that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.630" end="00:05:40.750" style="s2">way forward for the space is driver</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">monitoring so if we look super cruise</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.750" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">has great driver monitor</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.150" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">I should have my links already</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">so maybe they show yeah so right here</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.610" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I tried out supercruise on</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">Sunday I was very impressed they have it</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:09.240" style="s2">they have a camera monitoring the driver</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:12.060" style="s2">it felt very unlikely to make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.240" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">which in some ways is bad because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.060" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">reassures you but in another way they</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:17.220" style="s2">are they are monitoring you so I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:19.020" style="s2">think that&#39;s the either way forward um</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.220" end="00:06:21.690" style="s2">so this is my draft medium post that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.020" end="00:06:28.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on safety and driver</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.690" end="00:06:31.290" style="s2">attention this is an interesting link</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.280" end="00:06:33.260" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look to the left is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.290" end="00:06:36.060" style="s2">original video in the middle is a</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.040" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">it will be mandatory um now I still</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.370" end="00:07:58.980" style="s2">think we&#39;re in a were in a pretty ok</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:08:01.810" style="s2">situation because you know open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.980" end="00:08:05.090" style="s2">still makes a decent numbers</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.810" end="00:08:08.020" style="s2">and as long as it does make mistakes you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.090" end="00:08:11.150" style="s2">won&#39;t confuse it for a superhuman system</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.020" end="00:08:15.139" style="s2">also I hope nobody is driving 10 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:21.590" style="s2">day you feel so sorry for the safety</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.139" end="00:08:23.960" style="s2">driver I mean again if we had to if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.590" end="00:08:26.660" style="s2">had to you know put blame you can also</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.960" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">break a lot of safety down into into</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.660" end="00:08:34.669" style="s2">three categories right um so with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:39.400" style="s2">of car companies talk about safety not</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.669" end="00:08:42.110" style="s2">not all of them you have legal safety</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.400" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">which which which legal safety is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.110" end="00:08:47.150" style="s2">concerned with okay who&#39;s to blame here</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.570" style="s2">you know how do we how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.150" end="00:08:55.400" style="s2">we stop down on this behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.570" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">somewhat of an okay problem um then</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.400" end="00:09:01.570" style="s2">there&#39;s signaling safety signaling</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2">safety is to me absolutely disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.570" end="00:09:10.370" style="s2">when you see you know oh my god like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">way they they write up these like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.370" end="00:09:13.820" style="s2">not helping the problem you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">trying to virtually signal and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.820" end="00:09:17.510" style="s2">lot of problems in the world are caused</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:22.700" style="s2">by very sickly um but what we care about</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.510" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">is is is statistical safety right so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.700" end="00:09:30.709" style="s2">now have hundreds of people out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">driving with all the pilot and we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.709" end="00:09:34.580" style="s2">to figure out how to not just make open</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.020" style="s2">pilot you know as safe as you doing but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.580" end="00:09:38.600" style="s2">how do we how do we move forward toward</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.020" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">making it safer right so open pilot is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.600" end="00:09:44.839" style="s2">always watching the road and then with</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.110" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">you always watching the road the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.839" end="00:09:48.740" style="s2">cars in the road have at most one and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:50.600" style="s2">you know sometimes a little bit less</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.740" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">than one may be the expected value for</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.600" end="00:10:02.810" style="s2">most cars in the road of a driver paying</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.100" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">attention is like 0.98 honestly if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.810" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">look at that situation if there was no</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:11.450" style="s2">uber or anything criminally charged a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:12.710" style="s2">driver</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.450" end="00:10:17.180" style="s2">you get their phone they tell somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.710" end="00:10:18.710" style="s2">maybe you do oh yeah you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.180" end="00:10:22.790" style="s2">really interested in in who&#39;s to blame</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.710" end="00:10:29.270" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in how the industry moves</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.790" end="00:10:31.630" style="s2">forward so who&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.270" end="00:10:31.630" style="s2">uber</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.840" end="00:10:46.210" style="s2">but yeah so we&#39;ll be releasing in two</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:48.370" style="s2">weeks we&#39;ll be releasing the front</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.210" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">camera recording option and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:55.960" style="s2">instructions to flip around your so as</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">you can see we haven&#39;t uh no I&#39;m I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.960" end="00:10:59.260" style="s2">interested that&#39;s the concept of legal</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:04.630" style="s2">safety right like I&#39;m not been</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.260" end="00:11:06.070" style="s2">interested in determining the truth I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.630" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">interested in getting the facts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.070" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">why I didn&#39;t really say anything about</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:13.690" style="s2">this you know everyone who said things</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:21.640" style="s2">about this especially before the before</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.690" end="00:11:26.680" style="s2">the the dashcam footage came out but</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.640" end="00:11:27.880" style="s2">yeah so no actually so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.680" end="00:11:29.890" style="s2">difference between organizations like</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.880" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">NTSB initiative right initiative</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.890" end="00:11:34.029" style="s2">turbines like who has to pay and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:35.800" style="s2">to blame and what the but then a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.029" end="00:11:37.060" style="s2">organizations like NTSB who look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.800" end="00:11:40.650" style="s2">they&#39;re really just trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.060" end="00:11:45.280" style="s2">truth of the matter um so interesti</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.650" end="00:11:50.650" style="s2">report on autopilot blasts if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.280" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">remember it they went into oh yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.650" end="00:11:53.950" style="s2">like my big mouse pad big mouse pad</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:56.140" style="s2">right I bought it before PewDiePie was</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.950" end="00:11:57.370" style="s2">on the big mouse pad thing - how does it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.140" end="00:11:58.690" style="s2">handle running both cameras at the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.370" end="00:12:00.790" style="s2">time both cameras have been running the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.690" end="00:12:01.900" style="s2">same time the whole time we run the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.790" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">front camera the whole time we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.900" end="00:12:06.280" style="s2">upload it we don&#39;t record it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.050" style="s2">been running so I would worry about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.280" end="00:12:09.730" style="s2">we used it we used to use it for that a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.050" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">rear view mirror thing which which</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.730" end="00:12:14.530" style="s2">pretty much no one uses anymore but um</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;ll be able to record both</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.530" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">cameras at the same time we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">make it so you&#39;ll be able to access all</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:21.670" style="s2">your front count and we haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:24.940" style="s2">monitoring you don&#39;t worry we got our</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.670" end="00:12:28.450" style="s2">first front camera footage today from</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.940" end="00:12:29.890" style="s2">Annie on and one of our yachts no we</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.450" end="00:12:32.080" style="s2">don&#39;t record the front camera we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.890" end="00:12:34.150" style="s2">record the microphone now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.080" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">have optional front camera recording but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.150" end="00:12:41.380" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be off by default I&#39;ll begin</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:42.790" style="s2">like I said if we do ship yeah bro III</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.380" end="00:12:44.290" style="s2">know I don&#39;t wanna know you doing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.790" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">front seat like that&#39;s I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.290" end="00:12:49.150" style="s2">want this video though but I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:50.350" style="s2">a good step for safety could I display</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.150" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">the back of camera on you and you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.350" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">display the back of camera</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:59.320" style="s2">um yeah facebooking back right right I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:00.910" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t want the mic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.320" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">even want to do optional microphone to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.910" end="00:13:06.130" style="s2">be honest guys I just I don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">data right you know that&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.130" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">not a safety thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:13.240" style="s2">the front camera I think it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:15.070" style="s2">forward I think it is the way forward</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.240" end="00:13:19.029" style="s2">you know Tesla shipped they called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.070" end="00:13:20.620" style="s2">selfie cam in the model three so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.029" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">kind of my take on these things I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.620" end="00:13:26.140" style="s2">both of the recent accidents and that of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:29.380" style="s2">course the auto pilot truck accident in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.140" end="00:13:33.370" style="s2">Florida the auto pilot death in China I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.380" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">think all four of those how much meth am</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.370" end="00:13:41.260" style="s2">I on I think all four of those would</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:42.690" style="s2">have been prevented if the driver was</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.260" end="00:13:44.830" style="s2">paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.690" end="00:13:48.250" style="s2">the new model doesn&#39;t use the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.830" end="00:13:53.470" style="s2">I have a left rolling okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.250" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">serious sculpey Sunday no oh oh you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.470" end="00:13:56.950" style="s2">a giant panda if you have a giant panda</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:13:58.390" style="s2">and you put that in the Neo I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.950" end="00:14:02.020" style="s2">that back and you can I&#39;ll leave you the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.390" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">discount me I&#39;m sure you want audio to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.020" end="00:14:08.290" style="s2">catch other side admitting fault focus</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:10.060" style="s2">focus so not interesting you guys what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.290" end="00:14:11.800" style="s2">interesting is like just how can we how</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.060" end="00:14:16.209" style="s2">can we improve statistical safety period</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.800" end="00:14:17.500" style="s2">right anybody who&#39;s actually right you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.209" end="00:14:19.330" style="s2">know I think the computer security</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.500" end="00:14:22.300" style="s2">industry is particularly like despicable</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.330" end="00:14:24.250" style="s2">when it comes to a lot of this yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:28.209" style="s2">not just drivers should pay attention it</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.250" end="00:14:32.200" style="s2">you actually have a this this this may</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.209" end="00:14:34.750" style="s2">be the word is uncanny valley for glad</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.200" end="00:14:36.990" style="s2">to see you and yo we&#39;ve kept I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.750" end="00:14:39.610" style="s2">safety a lot right I just don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.990" end="00:14:42.029" style="s2">those safety is at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.610" end="00:14:44.470" style="s2">everything we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.029" end="00:14:45.970" style="s2">what&#39;s that even mean like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.470" end="00:14:47.650" style="s2">doing there is you&#39;re emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:50.740" style="s2">signaling right please show me if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.650" end="00:14:57.820" style="s2">care about safety please show me the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.740" end="00:14:59.829" style="s2">facts which test the crash so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.820" end="00:15:02.740" style="s2">mean Tesla has also gone billions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.829" end="00:15:04.220" style="s2">miles with autopilot so to say there</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.740" end="00:15:07.670" style="s2">have been three deaths that we know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.220" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">about maybe some that we don&#39;t but still</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.670" end="00:15:11.690" style="s2">the numbers I&#39;m sure and far from what</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:14.960" style="s2">you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.690" end="00:15:16.850" style="s2">mandatory upload no no so mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.960" end="00:15:18.590" style="s2">upload there&#39;s no mandatory upload for</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.850" end="00:15:20.420" style="s2">the front camera I really I don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.690" end="00:17:25.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s really a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.320" end="00:17:26.420" style="s2">discussion about how we can move safety</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.130" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">forward yes we do keep stats on that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.420" end="00:17:34.370" style="s2">I mean people recover people touch very</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">quickly after after the awareness limit</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.370" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s like hitting the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:42.050" style="s2">limit is not necessarily bad I&#39;m getting</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.430" end="00:18:03.260" style="s2">with open pilot um not that I know about</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:05.780" style="s2">was there ever a crash wall open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.260" end="00:18:08.900" style="s2">was engaged not to know about there was</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:16.070" style="s2">system was off and the main one thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.840" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">was actually talked about on slack as</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.070" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">there was a rear ending if someone was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:24.020" style="s2">rear-ended it may be 10 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:26.060" style="s2">not fast yeah it&#39;s interesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.020" end="00:18:27.920" style="s2">know view that in in Cabana</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.060" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">well front-facing camera impact the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.920" end="00:18:30.800" style="s2">awareness limit so yeah I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:34.070" style="s2">kind of the replacement for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.800" end="00:18:35.870" style="s2">awareness limit going forward so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.070" end="00:18:40.610" style="s2">we&#39;re going to ship in the next release</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.870" end="00:18:45.170" style="s2">is just front camera recording not front</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.610" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">camera monitoring yet interested in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.170" end="00:18:51.920" style="s2">research paper on self driving unsafe</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:53.780" style="s2">driving behavior maybe so again you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.920" end="00:18:55.100" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t even sell anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.780" end="00:19:00.920" style="s2">that drives your car we give away some</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.100" end="00:19:02.630" style="s2">free software we trust that the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.920" end="00:19:04.430" style="s2">who here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s a here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.630" end="00:19:06.200" style="s2">another thing where we&#39;re you know these</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.430" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">are my personal feelings on a company</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.200" end="00:19:13.700" style="s2">and consumers we trust that you&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:15.590" style="s2">we trust that you guys the users have</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.700" end="00:19:18.470" style="s2">open pilot you know aren&#39;t out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.590" end="00:19:20.450" style="s2">doing stupid things now when you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.470" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">you have us so when you have Tesla this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.450" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">is generally true you know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:30.460" style="s2">certain sort of consumer who&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.460" style="s2">more more educated on this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.860" end="00:19:35.269" style="s2">when you if you want to reach millions</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:38.120" style="s2">and millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.269" end="00:19:41.029" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to uh got to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.120" end="00:19:45.279" style="s2">idiot-proof right oh the EON is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.029" end="00:19:47.750" style="s2">dashcam the EON is absolutely a dashcam</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.279" end="00:19:49.220" style="s2">it&#39;s old it&#39;s a trashcan like it really</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.750" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">is it really is a dashcam you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.220" end="00:19:53.149" style="s2">make dash cams do we make a chipper app</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:56.600" style="s2">we give away some free software called</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.149" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">open pilot um it does run on the EON do</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.600" end="00:20:00.289" style="s2">you think factory sensors have fast</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.820" end="00:20:01.789" style="s2">enough response or self-driving I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.289" end="00:20:05.750" style="s2">almost every sensor is gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.789" end="00:20:06.470" style="s2">faster response in humans talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.750" end="00:20:09.230" style="s2">Aeon flipping</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.470" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">so the reason we flipped the Aeon is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.230" end="00:20:15.260" style="s2">because it puts the camera where it can</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:18.519" style="s2">see the driver it puts the the front</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.260" end="00:20:18.519" style="s2">camera where it can see the driver</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.639" end="00:20:23.649" style="s2">what would classify as a non aware</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.649" end="00:20:30.139" style="s2">you can see check out the MIT thing we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.779" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know yet so I suspect that okay</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.740" end="00:29:41.450" style="s2">is the motor in the car has more</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">stronger than you are so it can turn the</p>

<p begin="00:47:44.460" end="00:47:52.920" style="s2">open pilot and then that port will work</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.010" end="00:47:55.380" style="s2">similarly to other to the other cars in</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.920" end="00:47:56.970" style="s2">the open pilot fleet and you&#39;ll be able</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.890" end="00:48:18.380" style="s2">push basically a branch that works on</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.050" end="00:48:18.380" style="s2">your car</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.789" end="00:48:28.709" style="s2">$250,000 now if you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.069" end="00:48:36.239" style="s2">making cars $250,000 shouldn&#39;t really be</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.049" end="00:49:17.999" style="s2">we push it open source the truth is most</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.229" end="00:49:19.559" style="s2">meetings just go absolutely nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.999" end="00:49:23.849" style="s2">I&#39;m so once you&#39;re ready to work with us</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.559" end="00:49:26.729" style="s2">like that we&#39;re happy to do it but you</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.819" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">car assuming it has assuming it has</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.699" end="00:49:47.309" style="s2">actuators assuming it has some spec for</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.130" end="00:49:50.099" style="s2">actuators that we can tap into so then</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.309" end="00:49:53.429" style="s2">why are us the money why are the 50k</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.099" end="00:49:55.890" style="s2">down payment we&#39;ll meet and bring the</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.109" end="00:50:09.269" style="s2">I found that most meetings go almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.319" end="00:50:10.499" style="s2">nowhere Honda&#39;s actually do work a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.269" end="00:50:12.299" style="s2">little bit better than Toyota&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.299" end="00:50:15.390" style="s2">will be more representative of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.409" end="00:50:16.619" style="s2">you&#39;re getting assuming that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.390" end="00:50:18.089" style="s2">good spec for how to actually control</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.429" end="00:50:29.699" style="s2">only but the quality is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.609" end="00:50:30.959" style="s2">as good but any any normal radar is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.699" end="00:50:33.779" style="s2">good but I assume that&#39;s something</p>
