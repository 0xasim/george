<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">this dream is gonna be a whole lot more</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">chill and yesterday&#39;s dream we&#39;ll see if</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.980" end="00:02:50.269" style="s2">morning about masks and the article is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.549" end="00:02:54.260" style="s2">totally complete trash and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.269" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">I regret talking about masks even this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.260" end="00:03:03.799" style="s2">stuff even this like anti Google the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:08.690" style="s2">problem with even talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.799" end="00:03:16.700" style="s2">it is it attracts idiots whenever</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.690" end="00:03:28.060" style="s2">whatever this is a good article for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.700" end="00:03:33.650" style="s2">everybody to read and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.060" end="00:03:35.690" style="s2">really how how people view it politics</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.650" end="00:03:38.269" style="s2">is an extension of war by other means</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.040" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">all arguments of that side and attack</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.590" end="00:03:46.910" style="s2">all arguments that appear to favor the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:49.069" style="s2">enemy side otherwise it&#39;s like stabbing</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.069" end="00:03:52.760" style="s2">and comfort to the enemy people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:54.769" style="s2">would be level-headed about</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">right the general level of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:22.360" style="s2">about this kind of stuff is so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.010" style="s2">lower so that&#39;s why we&#39;re working on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.360" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">busy beaver problem today and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.010" end="00:04:27.820" style="s2">should I stream this or should I not</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:31.030" style="s2">stream this you know I regret doing any</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.820" end="00:04:33.039" style="s2">streams that ever talk about anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.030" end="00:04:35.530" style="s2">remotely controversial because honestly</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.039" end="00:04:38.260" style="s2">the Internet&#39;s about to it&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.530" end="00:04:40.210" style="s2">immature fucks I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.260" end="00:04:42.850" style="s2">specifically about my audience but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.210" end="00:04:45.070" style="s2">the internet for the most part is is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.850" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">is immature Fox and you know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.070" end="00:04:55.449" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to handle like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">intellectual and I I do think I&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.449" end="00:05:02.500" style="s2">this one point I think it has to do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:05.949" style="s2">so sad for the internet that we lost I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">so sad for the Internet 20 years ago on</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.949" end="00:05:11.350" style="s2">the internet but I grew up with where it</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:14.949" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like this and I do think it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.350" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">because well the people on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.949" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">were more mature and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:35.910" style="s2">do some quick intro the busy beaver game</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.480" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">consists of designing a halting binary</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.910" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">alphabet Turing machine so not all</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:39.420" style="s2">Turing machines halts on fall and some</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:41.790" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.420" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">you can&#39;t know which ones you can know</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.790" end="00:05:45.750" style="s2">for some to prove that a halting tired</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:49.320" style="s2">Machine halts you can just run it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.750" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">figure out until it halts to prove a non</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.320" end="00:05:53.910" style="s2">halting Turing machine does not halt</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:57.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a few ways to do this so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.910" end="00:05:59.250" style="s2">easiest way is if you get a cycle so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.330" end="00:06:01.350" style="s2">can think of a Sigma you know Sigma</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.250" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">lowercase Sigma but now turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.350" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">right if your turn tiring tiring tiring</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:10.280" style="s2">time you go on a turn loop and then you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">reach a state that you&#39;ve been in before</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.280" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">let&#39;s say at state 100 is a repeat of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:18.900" style="s2">state 30 well the same thing is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:21.750" style="s2">happen again at state 170 you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.900" end="00:06:24.710" style="s2">get a repeat of state 100 which is state</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.750" end="00:06:27.210" style="s2">30 so on and so forth so that has a I</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.710" end="00:06:32.510" style="s2">mean y-intercept and slope aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.210" end="00:06:38.820" style="s2">the right things but it has a intro of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.510" end="00:06:39.570" style="s2">of 30 and then like a step of 70 so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.820" end="00:06:42.300" style="s2">is halting me</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.570" end="00:06:44.190" style="s2">um so halting in a Turing machine is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.300" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">usually just a state that States called</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.190" end="00:06:49.320" style="s2">the halt state you can make more generic</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">statements like you can&#39;t prove of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.320" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">Turing machine ever gets into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:57.810" style="s2">state so maybe a way to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:07:00.090" style="s2">is gonna be to look at do they have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.810" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">bunch of those nice old pictures here</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.090" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">they roll graphs</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.290" end="00:07:12.170" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is like um this this</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:22.190" style="s2">represents a time machine so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.170" end="00:07:23.660" style="s2">in state a and you come upon a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.190" end="00:07:24.830" style="s2">exactly there are there notations a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:26.180" style="s2">little bit different from mine so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.830" end="00:07:27.950" style="s2">don&#39;t exactly understand it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.180" end="00:07:29.690" style="s2">um but Z is the halt state all right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.950" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">the Turing machine bounces around states</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.690" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">like a to be back to a to B to D that to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.920" end="00:07:45.170" style="s2">be back to a and then maybe it makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:48.010" style="s2">this transition here over to Z I&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.170" end="00:07:48.010" style="s2">you that&#39;s what all that means</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.700" end="00:07:58.350" style="s2">running my own private Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:08:01.150" style="s2">instance it&#39;s never gonna my Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.350" end="00:08:04.810" style="s2">imagine your computer hit you up and was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.150" end="00:08:07.720" style="s2">like yo could you give me $3 yo you got</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:09.310" style="s2">$3 it&#39;s like it&#39;s like you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.720" end="00:08:14.010" style="s2">go out on the street the homes people</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.310" end="00:08:14.010" style="s2">give me $3 I go on Wikipedia give me $3</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:29.740" style="s2">if it goes to see Ana terminates yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.030" end="00:08:34.780" style="s2">the rules for the two-state game are as</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.740" end="00:08:36.940" style="s2">follows so it&#39;s it&#39;s a two-state wait no</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.780" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2">not Tuesday so it&#39;s a binary alphabet so</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.940" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">it all it has is zeros and ones there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:46.840" style="s2">two ways I&#39;ve heard it talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:49.090" style="s2">can say what is the machine that runs</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.840" end="00:08:50.380" style="s2">for the longest without halting and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.090" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">what is the machine that writes the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.380" end="00:09:01.210" style="s2">number of ones on the tape so a few cute</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:03.010" style="s2">things it&#39;s really easy to show that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.210" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">the busy beaver function is non</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.010" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">computable I&#39;m not sure this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:12.850" style="s2">proof that they&#39;re gonna go into but my</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">understanding of the simplest proof is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.850" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">then well if you knew the busy beaver</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">number say for a 13 state Turing machine</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:23.320" style="s2">and you had an arbitrary 13 state Turing</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">machine and you wanted to know whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.320" end="00:09:27.100" style="s2">it was going to halt or not well you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">could just simulate it for the busy</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.100" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">beaver functions number of steps and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:36.760" style="s2">then if it didn&#39;t halt it&#39;ll never halt</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:38.500" style="s2">right busy beavers are totally and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.760" end="00:09:41.620" style="s2">completely useless and if you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.500" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">for useful shit fuck off from now on</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.620" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">this dream is a useless stream that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">talks about nothing controversial except</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">for finite ism</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.790" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">this is this was a really cool super</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.190" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">impress when I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.510" end="00:10:25.990" style="s2">you know you gotta be you gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.709" end="00:10:25.990" style="s2">careful what links you click these days</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:39.140" style="s2">this is see I want now I know Scott</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.910" end="00:10:47.140" style="s2">Aaronson</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.140" end="00:10:52.960" style="s2">let&#39;s try Scott Aaronson blog this I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">want that I want no I want the blog post</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.960" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">turn machine DF independence ah yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.530" end="00:11:12.530" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.650" end="00:11:22.520" style="s2">this is a really cool theory about so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.090" end="00:11:24.170" style="s2">the busy beaver number is theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.520" end="00:11:25.340" style="s2">incomputable all right like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.170" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no function that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.340" end="00:11:31.220" style="s2">return the busy beaver for n but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:35.930" style="s2">seems like we can get some of them right</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.220" end="00:11:37.670" style="s2">we know the the number 4 2 3 &amp; 4 what</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.930" end="00:11:42.050" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna work on today is the number</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.670" end="00:11:44.330" style="s2">4 5 which the number 4 5 we have a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.050" end="00:11:45.980" style="s2">lower bound on it&#39;s easy to get a lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.330" end="00:11:47.480" style="s2">bound if you as soon as you find the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:50.630" style="s2">machine with that number of states that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.480" end="00:11:55.840" style="s2">halts either after running for this many</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.630" end="00:12:01.400" style="s2">steps or printing this many ones you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.840" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">have a lower bound and if we happen to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.400" end="00:12:05.750" style="s2">magically find one that runs four more</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.220" style="s2">steps or prints more ones we can update</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.750" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">these numbers but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.220" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to so this is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:17.840" style="s2">the busy beaver number from the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">bound which says that the what busy</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.840" end="00:12:26.230" style="s2">beaver number can&#39;t we compute and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:26.230" style="s2">there&#39;s some things in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">yeah it follows as an immediate</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.390" end="00:12:37.630" style="s2">consequence of goggles and completeness</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:38.380" style="s2">care that there&#39;s some computer program</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.630" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">of some length</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.380" end="00:12:43.320" style="s2">that eludes the power of ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:43.320" style="s2">mathematics to prove what it does</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.580" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s it this is this is a cute</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.339" end="00:12:56.410" style="s2">simple one enumerate all the possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:58.330" style="s2">consequences of the CFC axioms you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.410" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">enumerate those that said axioms you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.330" end="00:13:00.700" style="s2">apply them</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:03.670" style="s2">I mean halt if it ever found a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.700" end="00:13:05.079" style="s2">contradiction assuming ZFC is consistent</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.670" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">this program must run forever but then</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.079" end="00:13:08.829" style="s2">again assuming it&#39;s consistent it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:10.540" style="s2">prove that the program runs forever</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.829" end="00:13:12.339" style="s2">since if it did that would prove with no</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.540" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">consistency thereby violating the second</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.339" end="00:13:26.019" style="s2">it completes there so if you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">encode that axiom enumerator in a Turing</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.019" end="00:13:31.209" style="s2">machine figure out how many states that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:34.329" style="s2">Turing machine has you know that busy</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.209" end="00:13:38.019" style="s2">beaver number is is in computable you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.329" end="00:13:42.430" style="s2">can&#39;t know this this is a program in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.019" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">math that you can prove that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.430" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">never prove and as as fun little asides</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:54.730" style="s2">they also made a 48 88 state Turing</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">machine that halts if there&#39;s a counter</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.730" end="00:13:58.620" style="s2">example to Goldbach&#39;s conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.890" end="00:14:01.510" style="s2">you all know Goldbach&#39;s conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.620" end="00:14:04.390" style="s2">Globox conjecture says every number is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.510" end="00:14:07.480" style="s2">the sum of two primes except two I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.390" end="00:14:09.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right I&#39;m not going to fix it up</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.480" end="00:14:13.190" style="s2">with something else</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.640" end="00:14:14.600" style="s2">yeah every every integer great ever even</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.190" end="00:14:16.850" style="s2">integer greater than 2 can be expressed</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.600" end="00:14:19.490" style="s2">as two primes you take four it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.850" end="00:14:26.330" style="s2">plus two if you take six is b + 3 8 is 3</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.490" end="00:14:27.740" style="s2">+ 5 so in sum and a 53 72 state machine</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.330" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">that halts if and only if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.740" end="00:14:32.950" style="s2">counter example to the Riemann</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">hypothesis the Riemann hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.950" end="00:14:37.220" style="s2">explanation is too short to fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:44.740" style="s2">stream but it says some weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.220" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">about Zeta functions all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.740" end="00:14:55.210" style="s2">someone just has to do with primes that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:15:01.420" style="s2">I read this proof out of this book yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.210" end="00:15:01.420" style="s2">no no I think yeah it&#39;s the same guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.120" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">I think I think I think this was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.890" end="00:15:16.990" style="s2">book I read or maybe it was a it went</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">into trying to explain the Riemann</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.990" end="00:15:22.210" style="s2">hypothesis and I really tried to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:23.740" style="s2">through it and I would still love to sit</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.210" end="00:15:25.870" style="s2">down with someone who can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.740" end="00:15:29.490" style="s2">explain to me what the Riemann</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.870" end="00:15:29.490" style="s2">hypothesis is in a way that I understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.560" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">so this was this was done two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.200" end="00:15:50.580" style="s2">they were so cool like I could have done</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:54.450" style="s2">it you know so that&#39;s just it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.580" end="00:15:56.250" style="s2">hope that math is accessible to - to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.450" end="00:16:01.350" style="s2">hackers because it&#39;s it certain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.250" end="00:16:06.330" style="s2">it&#39;s real it&#39;s real hacker stuff let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.350" end="00:16:09.930" style="s2">let&#39;s get his name right Adam I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.330" end="00:16:12.830" style="s2">even gonna try out the last name but he</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.930" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">wrote basically a Turing machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.830" end="00:16:20.730" style="s2">compiler that makes small Turing</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:23.270" style="s2">machines or this laconic that&#39;s a cute</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.730" end="00:16:23.270" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.329" end="00:16:42.519" style="s2">and then this language compiles to small</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.179" end="00:16:45.410" style="s2">towering machines</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.519" end="00:16:49.029" style="s2">it has like an unpacker it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.410" end="00:16:49.029" style="s2">writing on a grating shellcode</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.810" end="00:17:02.270" style="s2">so let&#39;s work through this paper um well</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:04.310" style="s2">so here&#39;s my notes they&#39;re public as</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.270" end="00:17:10.370" style="s2">part of the twitch cock repository on</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.310" end="00:17:13.550" style="s2">github so if you&#39;re not evilly talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.370" end="00:17:16.370" style="s2">about the five-state char machine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.550" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">talking about how many well let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.370" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">through what there</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.170" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">this is the notation that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.500" end="00:17:39.880" style="s2">on this scale at page this pages from</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">2003 and let&#39;s look into who this guy is</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.880" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">he seemed she seemed to come pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">close to to proving it and this was 2003</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">so I don&#39;t really know why he gave up</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:16.750" style="s2">the codes in Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.100" end="00:18:28.700" style="s2">and there&#39;s a yahoo email I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.350" end="00:18:28.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what you had in 2003</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.789" end="00:18:39.850" style="s2">do some anonymous person came just did</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.580" end="00:18:44.350" style="s2">this so this is the notation that he</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.850" end="00:18:45.940" style="s2">uses to represent the programs the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.350" end="00:18:48.820" style="s2">Turing machine programs the state is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.940" end="00:18:52.539" style="s2">imply the state is implied so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.820" end="00:18:59.230" style="s2">for state this is like a 0 a 1 meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.539" end="00:19:02.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a if you&#39;re in state a and 0 if</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.230" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">what you read on the tape is a 0 so then</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.620" end="00:19:07.570" style="s2">this says transition to state C right a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:15.070" style="s2">0 to the tape and then move the tape</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.570" end="00:19:18.669" style="s2">head left so naively not worrying at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.070" end="00:19:22.029" style="s2">about D duping we say that there are six</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.669" end="00:19:23.529" style="s2">states one of the states is those 5 plus</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.029" end="00:19:26.649" style="s2">1 States because one of the states is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.529" end="00:19:28.539" style="s2">halt state so you have 5 the halt state</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.649" end="00:19:30.519" style="s2">once you enter the whole state you never</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.539" end="00:19:36.999" style="s2">leave the whole state just spends a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.519" end="00:19:44.200" style="s2">little bit see if 5 plus 1 states 6 2</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.999" end="00:19:46.299" style="s2">possible or I guess oh no no never mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.200" end="00:19:49.299" style="s2">this is the 5 plus 1 States right here</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.299" end="00:19:50.619" style="s2">so that&#39;s 6 6 possible values for this 2</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.299" end="00:19:52.990" style="s2">possible values for this and two</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.619" end="00:19:56.409" style="s2">possible values for this 6 times 2 times</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.990" end="00:19:59.080" style="s2">2 is 24 there are 10 labels 24 to the 10</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.409" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">is 60 feet trillion so we have 63</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.080" end="00:20:05.369" style="s2">trillion possible machines in which to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:09.519" style="s2">find our busy beaver</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.369" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">so usually whenever you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.519" end="00:20:12.490" style="s2">searching in a set like this the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:14.470" style="s2">thing you want to say is how many of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.490" end="00:20:18.399" style="s2">these machines are isomorphic how many</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.470" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">of these machines have the same behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.399" end="00:20:23.289" style="s2">like prove the same behavior so for</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:26.649" style="s2">example one trivial way we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.289" end="00:20:28.029" style="s2">about some some symmetries one symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.649" end="00:20:30.700" style="s2">is the symmetry of the names of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.029" end="00:20:33.789" style="s2">states so if I rename all the states to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.700" end="00:20:36.369" style="s2">other things with the exception of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.789" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">halt state because the whole state is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.369" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">special because you halt and with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:44.490" style="s2">exception of the a state because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.490" style="s2">believe you start in the a state</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.530" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">then yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s still a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.090" end="00:20:54.140" style="s2">degrees of freedom there which I can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">identical machines also left and right</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.140" end="00:20:57.559" style="s2">the tape of the Turing machine is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.140" style="s2">completely symmetric so if I switch all</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.559" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">the left&#39;s two rights and all the rights</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.140" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">to left&#39;s it should do the same ones and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">zeros would be symmetric work the goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.100" style="s2">oh actually that&#39;s not true the Turing</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.679" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">was looking at this paper this morning</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">and I realized something kind of sad too</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.490" end="00:22:22.520" style="s2">is kind of breaking my brain for the</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:29.150" style="s2">interesting is I mean this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.580" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">approach taken by mr. skeleton so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.150" end="00:25:33.640" style="s2">is the BB provers open source we can we</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:33.640" style="s2">can run</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:54.780" style="s2">see it going through machines um no one</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.780" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve potentially doing this one problem</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:11.900" style="s2">why perhaps it hasn&#39;t been done is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:14.190" style="s2">may end up with the Collatz conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.900" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use my local instance of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.190" end="00:26:23.700" style="s2">Wikipedia for this because fuck the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:26.550" style="s2">internet the Collatz conjecture is it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.700" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">a conjecture mathematics that&#39;s concerns</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.550" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">a sequence to find a small start with</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:31.620" style="s2">any positive integer and then each term</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:33.720" style="s2">is obtained from the previous term as</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.620" end="00:26:35.280" style="s2">follows if the previous term is even the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.720" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">next term is one-half the previous term</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.280" end="00:26:39.030" style="s2">if the previous term is odd the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.040" style="s2">term is three times the previous term</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.030" end="00:26:43.140" style="s2">plus one the conjecture is that no</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.040" end="00:26:46.050" style="s2">matter that what value of n the sequence</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.140" end="00:26:48.330" style="s2">will always reach one does the Collatz</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.050" end="00:26:51.720" style="s2">sequence eventually reach one for all</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.330" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">positive integer initial values okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.720" end="00:27:04.020" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s try one I&#39;ll write it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:07.470" style="s2">out so we&#39;re gonna start with six you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.020" end="00:27:12.870" style="s2">get to 3 right 3 times 3 plus 1 is 10</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.470" end="00:27:18.270" style="s2">get to 5 that gets us to 16 alright</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.870" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">because 5 times 3 is 15 plus 1 16</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.270" end="00:27:21.690" style="s2">divided by 2 because it&#39;s even as a 4 2</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:23.820" style="s2">and then 1</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.690" end="00:27:26.160" style="s2">so 6 works is that true for all numbers</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:30.300" style="s2">now the problem with the Collatz</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.160" end="00:27:34.020" style="s2">conjecture is the procedure is very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.300" end="00:27:36.450" style="s2">simple yet there&#39;s no proof for this yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.020" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">so if we can show I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.450" end="00:27:42.300" style="s2">would be a really cool mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:44.490" style="s2">result as well we could show well yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.300" end="00:27:49.800" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the old all that sealed was</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.490" end="00:27:52.620" style="s2">Hilbert was like some some mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.800" end="00:27:54.540" style="s2">was criticizing Hilbert for his like</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.620" end="00:27:57.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like Hilbert&#39;s list of unsolved</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.540" end="00:27:59.250" style="s2">problems well anyone could write a list</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.030" end="00:28:01.550" style="s2">of unsolvable problems it&#39;s so easy I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.250" end="00:28:04.890" style="s2">told her it&#39;s like okay give me give me</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.550" end="00:28:06.809" style="s2">three and the mathematician couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.890" end="00:28:07.860" style="s2">even come up with one because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.809" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">really hard it&#39;s really hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.860" end="00:28:14.610" style="s2">problems that are are hard to to say or</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:15.990" style="s2">not busy beaver is an interesting place</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.610" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">to potentially look for these right</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.990" end="00:28:26.370" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to translate you&#39;ll have to</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:50.030" style="s2">yeah so you got distracted we&#39;ll go back</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.580" end="00:28:50.030" style="s2">to the paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.360" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">but analyze all before your machines</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:19.549" style="s2">which it now is by hand provided</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:22.820" style="s2">analysis of the four state to symbol</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.549" end="00:29:27.950" style="s2">machines which also used programs to</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.130" end="00:29:44.779" style="s2">so this is basically saying that the</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.779" end="00:29:49.639" style="s2">very good we just kind of came to accept</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.970" end="00:29:52.309" style="s2">them and the five one is probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.639" end="00:29:54.260" style="s2">correct as well but we live in an era</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.460" end="00:30:53.060" style="s2">in the space I read all his papers and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.500" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">tried to implement them my</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.060" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">implementations whenever as good as his</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.050" style="s2">but I wanted to use all I tried using</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.380" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">Sat solvers against it I still like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.050" end="00:31:03.170" style="s2">code somewhere I have a Sat solver which</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:08.780" style="s2">can find like 40 step collisions in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.170" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">sha-1 but I couldn&#39;t get it sat really</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.780" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">interests me as well maybe well did we</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:13.820" style="s2">do a stream that well he wrote us a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:15.800" style="s2">flower</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.820" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">maybe we tried we didn&#39;t actually get</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.800" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">through it because you know part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:24.260" style="s2">reason I was able to do twitch slam so</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:27.350" style="s2">well is because I spent six months</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.260" end="00:31:30.110" style="s2">before that like studying slam deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.350" end="00:31:33.230" style="s2">studying slam we have an internal slam</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.110" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">at comma so when it comes to writing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.230" end="00:31:36.290" style="s2">toy one fort which I could do it very</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:37.970" style="s2">well and twitch slam looks impressive</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.290" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">but what you don&#39;t see is all the work</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.970" end="00:31:44.230" style="s2">that goes into it so if I do a Sat</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:48.380" style="s2">solver stream you have to work in right</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.230" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">you know in some ways I have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.380" end="00:31:54.740" style="s2">expectation for wanting this stream to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:59.060" style="s2">be high quality but I don&#39;t put much</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.740" end="00:32:00.830" style="s2">effort into it so that&#39;s kind of on me</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.060" end="00:32:02.390" style="s2">like if I want my stream to look like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.830" end="00:32:06.110" style="s2">shit talking our I prepare for this</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.390" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">dream like it should talking out you</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.110" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">know use a little bit more self-control</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.800" end="00:32:32.970" style="s2">prep for and share the topping in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.110" style="s2">discord we don&#39;t have a discord I wish</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.970" end="00:32:36.330" style="s2">we had nice tools</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.110" end="00:32:40.710" style="s2">I wish we had tools which could build</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.330" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">nice communities part of it so part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.710" end="00:32:44.220" style="s2">it I don&#39;t mean to just attack people</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:46.950" style="s2">and say people have done a bad job at</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.220" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">this because like a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.950" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">very hard it&#39;s it&#39;s not an easy problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:52.260" style="s2">the only people who I would really</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:56.730" style="s2">attack or people who I think are doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.260" end="00:33:00.360" style="s2">it in bad faith in the early days of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">internet PHP BB MediaWiki these these</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.360" end="00:33:06.150" style="s2">projects were not written in bad faith</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.070" end="00:33:18.420" style="s2">oh yeah so I mean if we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:23.490" style="s2">nice community where you keep out really</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.420" end="00:33:25.700" style="s2">all the toxicity then we can have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.490" end="00:33:27.810" style="s2">discord where we could study and prepare</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.700" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">this is part of the reason I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.810" end="00:33:38.150" style="s2">make the college I think maybe it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.150" end="00:33:43.920" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a fundamental problem that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.970" end="00:33:45.290" style="s2">when you give people anonymity and weak</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.290" end="00:33:50.900" style="s2">you get toxicity and psychopathic</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.230" end="00:37:24.460" style="s2">distraction all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.350" end="00:37:39.930" style="s2">there are over N to the N machines of</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.640" end="00:38:02.690" style="s2">plus one based to it Big O notation is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.510" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.690" end="00:38:05.610" style="s2">second the process for generating</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">machines needs to be carefully</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.610" end="00:38:08.610" style="s2">considered and based on sound principles</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:14.490" style="s2">rather than simply generating all</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.610" end="00:38:17.250" style="s2">machines of a given size oh well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.490" end="00:38:19.710" style="s2">that&#39;s true too if you have machines</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.250" end="00:38:21.600" style="s2">that have no connections between if some</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.710" end="00:38:23.880" style="s2">states are entirely disconnected or if</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.600" end="00:38:25.580" style="s2">you have Islands this is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.880" end="00:38:28.080" style="s2">machine of size 3 rather than the size 5</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.580" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">so tremendous exclusion to be avoided if</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.080" end="00:38:32.070" style="s2">possible thirdly in order to determine</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:33.420" style="s2">the busy beaver function when you only</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.070" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">to analyze the execution of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.420" end="00:38:39.540" style="s2">machines on a single input that means we</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:43.860" style="s2">kept engine takes place properties the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.540" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">intermissions the classic way to address</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.860" end="00:38:47.360" style="s2">these issues and to intermingle the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:50.820" style="s2">generation of the machines with their</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.360" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">execution I&#39;ve seen this so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.820" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">implemented this basically the trick is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">whenever you can do a state transition</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:39:04.890" style="s2">do it you&#39;ll and do both you&#39;ll find the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:06.630" style="s2">code I have the code for this yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.890" end="00:39:09.000" style="s2">tnf Oh beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.630" end="00:39:10.050" style="s2">so if we run TNF I think this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.000" end="00:39:13.620" style="s2">get alright yeah this is all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.050" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">possible machines with three states and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.620" end="00:39:15.620" style="s2">I think it eventually gives us the right</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:17.940" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.620" end="00:39:20.520" style="s2">yeah so if you&#39;re interested entry</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.940" end="00:39:23.780" style="s2">normal form it&#39;s already implemented in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.520" end="00:39:23.780" style="s2">the twitch concrete box</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:31.799" style="s2">get a parsley define machine in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.119" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">blanket Bunch on I like your transition</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.799" end="00:39:36.509" style="s2">it was an appropriate additional one its</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:37.799" style="s2">allocated there&#39;s only one of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.509" end="00:39:39.720" style="s2">checks so it does it it does it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.799" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">dynamically but this doesn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.720" end="00:39:47.970" style="s2">property that I want I don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:50.069" style="s2">recursive definition I want a the word</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.970" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">that comes to my mind is imperative but</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.069" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.180" end="00:40:03.540" style="s2">the TNF approach makes it attractive</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:04.980" style="s2">resisting the process generate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.540" end="00:40:07.890" style="s2">analyze machines rather than separating</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.980" end="00:40:10.020" style="s2">the two is discussed above oh actually I</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.890" end="00:40:15.980" style="s2">remember also if you want to run this</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:15.980" style="s2">shit mad fast yeah pi PI</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.130" end="00:40:33.210" style="s2">so prints the machine prints whether the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.140" end="00:40:36.110" style="s2">Machine bolts or not it doesn&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.210" end="00:40:36.110" style="s2">gonna get fault</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.120" end="00:40:57.590" style="s2">I think believe the other machines in</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.500" end="00:41:01.120" style="s2">like Joe Ron oh this is wrong I have I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.590" end="00:41:01.120" style="s2">have my time machine runner over here</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.080" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">you know and M s equals 100 means that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.090" end="00:41:18.500" style="s2">I&#39;ll run it for 100 steps that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:21.310" style="s2">getting all those 101 ok busy or - Wow I</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.500" end="00:41:26.600" style="s2">even - takes a long time</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.310" end="00:41:29.110" style="s2">so 4 - we got 6 and for all ass all</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.600" end="00:41:29.110" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.510" end="00:41:34.440" style="s2">Eggman</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:41.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s the count and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.790" end="00:41:47.480" style="s2">number so six and four I would expect to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.240" end="00:41:49.180" style="s2">find as the the numbers for yeah so six</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.480" end="00:41:52.040" style="s2">and four</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.180" end="00:41:55.570" style="s2">how&#39;s it for two states so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.040" end="00:41:55.570" style="s2">middle of three normal form program</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.040" end="00:42:08.630" style="s2">so yes this is all implemented</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.890" end="00:42:15.910" style="s2">our intention is to provide a data set</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.350" end="00:42:39.880" style="s2">generating a big table that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.980" style="s2">like we can you can turn a recursive</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.880" end="00:42:45.300" style="s2">function into a function where I can do</p>

<p begin="00:44:00.270" end="00:44:03.880" style="s2">this means we generally cannot reduce</p>

<p begin="00:44:15.780" end="00:44:20.290" style="s2">right because you do actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.560" end="00:44:30.730" style="s2">technically need a proof for the full</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.290" end="00:44:33.250" style="s2">combinatorics trillions and so you do</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.730" end="00:44:36.970" style="s2">actually need a proof for the the dirty</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.250" end="00:44:38.920" style="s2">there&#39;s sixty three trillion basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.970" end="00:44:40.990" style="s2">yeah what you would need to show is you</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.920" end="00:44:43.360" style="s2">need to show a procedure that can</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.990" end="00:44:51.030" style="s2">canonicalize any machine so if we want</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.360" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">like a certain ordering yeah right 36</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.030" end="00:45:04.570" style="s2">trillion is a 10 to the 16 that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.790" end="00:45:08.440" style="s2">large 62 Chile I think today yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.570" end="00:45:11.230" style="s2">actually it&#39;s almost 10 to 17 so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.440" end="00:45:13.780" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s beyond what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.230" end="00:45:17.610" style="s2">run today what is when is 10 to the 17</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.780" end="00:45:17.610" style="s2">analog I always like thinking in twos</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.840" end="00:45:29.580" style="s2">log to see the news articles 56</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.210" end="00:45:40.920" style="s2">say to 30 cents so yeah I mean can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">do to the 56 yeah but most try to find a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.920" end="00:45:44.520" style="s2">better way to I mean so so like what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.140" end="00:45:46.740" style="s2">could do with two to the 56 is you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.520" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">say you could enumerate everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.740" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">then come up with just little little</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:54.300" style="s2">like like a proof system to kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:55.140" style="s2">this one&#39;s equivalent to this one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.300" end="00:45:56.220" style="s2">already on the list this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.140" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">equivalent to this one it&#39;s already on</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.510" end="00:46:07.980" style="s2">that look like that more on section 2 we</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:10.620" style="s2">discussed related work and in section 3</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.980" end="00:46:14.700" style="s2">we discuss preliminaries or their quote</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.620" end="00:46:16.050" style="s2">is available to which I just write a</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.770" end="00:46:27.150" style="s2">but in there for this reason we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.740" end="00:46:28.710" style="s2">investigate formal results which</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.150" end="00:46:30.030" style="s2">establish the correctness of constraints</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.330" end="00:46:54.680" style="s2">think we understand now what it does</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.770" end="00:46:58.280" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.369" end="00:47:13.309" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s more important now than</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.089" end="00:51:49.259" style="s2">the weird choices of languages it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.059" end="00:51:51.499" style="s2">like this stuff&#39;s like written by</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.510" end="00:52:29.490" style="s2">interesting that yeah they&#39;ve gotten it</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.450" end="00:52:55.260" style="s2">lookalike think about we can we can well</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.910" end="00:52:58.650" style="s2">I was doing the file see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.260" end="00:53:01.110" style="s2">understand their format dude Wow Wow</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.650" end="00:53:03.990" style="s2">they saved in a hundred Meg&#39;s if file oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.110" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">that was so polite of them oh I love the</p>

<p begin="01:01:59.230" end="01:02:05.579" style="s2">okay um we could try to get this code to</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.160" end="01:02:08.470" style="s2">run but then it still involves trusting</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.579" end="01:02:13.050" style="s2">so this is the first step in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.470" end="01:02:13.050" style="s2">step here we have our attack steps here</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.470" end="01:02:19.690" style="s2">so we can re implement whatever there</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.740" end="01:02:21.490" style="s2">are search procedure is and hopefully we</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.849" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">on part on this part one extreme I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.950" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.620" end="01:02:44.460" style="s2">but that&#39;s probably too ambitious for</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.520" end="01:04:10.119" style="s2">we probably could have recovered that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.349" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">but like what would have we really ended</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.119" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.839" end="01:04:22.339" style="s2">here&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m thinking me</p>

<p begin="01:04:22.339" end="01:04:32.179" style="s2">interesting so tonight my homework and</p>

<p begin="01:04:32.179" end="01:04:35.539" style="s2">this paper is called generating canopy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.069" end="01:04:39.559" style="s2">fever machines or how to build the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.539" end="01:04:51.380" style="s2">zoom The Associated code is now in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.559" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">github and tomorrow we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.380" end="01:04:59.140" style="s2">reimplemented and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:05:05.769" style="s2">step one we&#39;re gonna re-implemented on</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.140" end="01:05:10.609" style="s2">I&#39;ll be on stream probably tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.769" end="01:05:13.549" style="s2">around the same time I can&#39;t link the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.609" end="01:05:14.959" style="s2">comments or online or on my phone but I</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.549" end="01:05:18.799" style="s2">think this is kind of gonna be the new</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.630" end="01:07:30.320" style="s2">there like a I want kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.170" end="01:07:30.320" style="s2">reddit style for the questions you know</p>

<p begin="01:07:57.269" end="01:08:00.779" style="s2">reason I don&#39;t want there to be a reddit</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.740" end="01:08:05.670" style="s2">is I don&#39;t want there to be a persistent</p>

<p begin="01:08:13.380" end="01:08:18.810" style="s2">problem with a persistent place is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.290" end="01:08:23.639" style="s2">place is going to be taken over by it by</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.810" end="01:08:26.219" style="s2">the psychopaths right the if you stand</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.639" end="01:08:27.659" style="s2">up something quickly everyone is there</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.219" end="01:08:30.179" style="s2">if no it&#39;s just like oh we just showed</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.659" end="01:08:31.679" style="s2">up that the the minds of those kind of</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.230" end="01:08:53.770" style="s2">just turn it into sub only and let</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.880" end="01:08:54.690" style="s2">people ask questions at the end oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.770" end="01:08:59.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.690" end="01:08:59.070" style="s2">yeah all right let&#39;s go solve only</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.970" end="01:09:17.490" style="s2">yeah well we&#39;ll answer a few questions</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:19.830" style="s2">but only for subscribers it&#39;s a good</p>

<p begin="01:09:43.730" end="01:09:52.430" style="s2">guys can vote a relatively short stream</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:59.030" style="s2">today but we&#39;re gonna try to turn us</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.430" end="01:10:00.980" style="s2">into as an a stream how should someone</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.030" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">who never coded start learning to code</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.980" end="01:10:10.910" style="s2">see if you weren&#39;t a sob I brush away</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:11.900" style="s2">that question real fast but actually you</p>

<p begin="01:13:05.510" end="01:13:08.630" style="s2">right and eventually yeah you could</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.890" end="01:13:11.360" style="s2">probably build like a structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.630" end="01:13:14.570" style="s2">capable of doing this how many high as</p>

<p begin="01:13:53.840" end="01:13:59.300" style="s2">simply easier to set up some simple chat</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.970" end="01:14:03.140" style="s2">rules and have mods enforce it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.300" end="01:14:06.050" style="s2">do this because the problem isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.140" end="01:14:08.150" style="s2">moderating obvious spam the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.050" end="01:14:09.950" style="s2">somebody&#39;s producing content that</p>

<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:22.670" style="s2">have a rule that says for example you</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.030" end="01:14:26.030" style="s2">know no racist comments and they&#39;re easy</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.670" end="01:14:28.430" style="s2">to moderate but having a rule that says</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.860" end="01:14:52.720" style="s2">for backspace and I kind of wanted to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.530" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">this I think what you can get with them</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.720" end="01:14:59.700" style="s2">as you can build pretty good linkers you</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:15:03.100" style="s2">can find bugs by finding code that&#39;s low</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.700" end="01:15:05.260" style="s2">but people don&#39;t when people if you</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.100" end="01:15:07.840" style="s2">watch me code I don&#39;t start at the top</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.260" end="01:15:09.700" style="s2">and slowly go down to the bottom unless</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.840" end="01:15:12.640" style="s2">you have a system that&#39;s capable of like</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:17.680" style="s2">it can code it racism is subjective as</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.640" end="01:15:20.680" style="s2">well today so even even a simple rule</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.680" end="01:15:26.230" style="s2">like that right so this this rule thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.680" end="01:15:27.910" style="s2">is completely impossible low-quality</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.979" end="01:20:57.919" style="s2">color anarchy is the absence of politics</p>

<p begin="01:20:57.919" end="01:21:02.939" style="s2">you&#39;re governed then just by the law of</p>

<p begin="01:21:16.350" end="01:21:21.660" style="s2">you know but me if politics is not the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.950" end="01:21:24.330" style="s2">way forward and maybe we use another</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.660" end="01:21:29.250" style="s2">word for it because that word is so is</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.330" end="01:21:30.870" style="s2">so tinged with with with crap um we need</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.250" end="01:21:33.770" style="s2">a Bitcoin for society that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.870" end="01:21:36.810" style="s2">comment I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.770" end="01:21:38.820" style="s2">literally you meant that if you mean it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.810" end="01:21:40.080" style="s2">literally as in we just pay society with</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.820" end="01:21:43.110" style="s2">Bitcoin and everything will be fine</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.080" end="01:21:45.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not true but the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.110" end="01:21:47.910" style="s2">formalization of the system in Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.690" end="01:21:52.490" style="s2">if you could figure out how to do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.910" end="01:21:52.490" style="s2">for moderation</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.520" end="01:22:26.730" style="s2">yeah a system that relies on everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.130" end="01:22:34.980" style="s2">becoming enlightened I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.730" end="01:22:36.390" style="s2">see working so well this yeah you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.980" end="01:22:39.180" style="s2">to build a system that has the right</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.390" end="01:22:42.090" style="s2">sort of you want to build a system that</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.180" end="01:22:43.500" style="s2">rewards quality and punishes lack of</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.090" end="01:22:44.940" style="s2">quality let&#39;s just say your social</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.500" end="01:22:46.590" style="s2">network right I mean social networks</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.940" end="01:22:48.270" style="s2">what are what are the people its</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.590" end="01:22:50.040" style="s2">governance in a social network whatever</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.270" end="01:22:51.810" style="s2">your policies are if you could figure</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.040" end="01:22:54.750" style="s2">out how to build a social network that</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.810" end="01:22:56.790" style="s2">rewards quality and punishes lack of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.750" end="01:22:59.360" style="s2">quality you&#39;d end up with the most</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.790" end="01:23:02.010" style="s2">incredible social networks so quickly</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.360" end="01:23:03.600" style="s2">the problem is what are the experts</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.010" end="01:23:07.590" style="s2">right so there&#39;s two ways to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.600" end="01:23:10.200" style="s2">explains and this is true in in security</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.590" end="01:23:13.110" style="s2">as well so one way to avoid exploits is</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.200" end="01:23:16.680" style="s2">to build something that is so incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.110" end="01:23:21.210" style="s2">secure the other way to avoid exploits</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.680" end="01:23:22.350" style="s2">is to not have something worth taking so</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.210" end="01:23:26.570" style="s2">these are actually that&#39;s all in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.350" end="01:23:30.630" style="s2">same spectrum if you have a system that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.570" end="01:23:32.610" style="s2">costs $100 to attack but only has 20</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.630" end="01:23:34.710" style="s2">dollars of value on it that system is</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.610" end="01:23:37.620" style="s2">not going to be attacked but if you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.710" end="01:23:39.420" style="s2">a system that has 100 that cost $1 to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.620" end="01:23:41.040" style="s2">attack but has you know a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.420" end="01:23:43.350" style="s2">dollars of value on it then that system</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.040" end="01:23:45.000" style="s2">is going to be attacked right I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.350" end="01:23:48.989" style="s2">that cost can include everything that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.000" end="01:23:54.750" style="s2">cost can include we go risk and all that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.989" end="01:24:01.410" style="s2">so on and so forth so the reason math</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.750" end="01:24:04.920" style="s2">seems to remain quality is that there is</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.410" end="01:24:08.180" style="s2">nothing really a value to take math kind</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.920" end="01:24:08.180" style="s2">of is its own reward</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.550" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">um well he of course that is that is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.780" end="01:24:21.980" style="s2">ultimate the ultimate problem who</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:21.980" style="s2">defines what is quality and what is not</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.190" end="01:24:33.870" style="s2">is quality objective no it&#39;s not a just</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.640" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s well but even true there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.870" end="01:24:37.020" style="s2">no objectivity when it comes to people</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:38.430" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a some objectivity for</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.020" end="01:24:40.140" style="s2">example there&#39;s no human that can run as</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.430" end="01:24:47.610" style="s2">fast as a cheetah that&#39;s an objective</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.140" end="01:24:51.320" style="s2">statement is true quality is truth yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.610" end="01:24:54.780" style="s2">again this suffers from this problem of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.320" end="01:24:57.230" style="s2">you can say a lot of meaningless true</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.780" end="01:24:57.230" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.610" end="01:25:14.170" style="s2">one component of politics is influencing</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.790" end="01:25:22.540" style="s2">other towards your ideas and no not</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.170" end="01:25:27.880" style="s2">everybody&#39;s into politics I really I I</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.540" end="01:25:33.820" style="s2">hate the idea but what else do you do</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.880" end="01:25:36.340" style="s2">when you realize that&#39;s if I could save</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.820" end="01:25:39.699" style="s2">the world through skateboarding I&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.340" end="01:25:43.690" style="s2">pro skateboarder save the world through</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.699" end="01:25:48.540" style="s2">math I&#39;d be a mathematician but who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.690" end="01:25:48.540" style="s2">gonna end the world with humans</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.290" end="01:25:55.060" style="s2">see but okay a statement like that means</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.620" end="01:25:56.950" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand what I mean when I</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.060" end="01:25:59.140" style="s2">say politics a statement like the media</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.950" end="01:26:02.740" style="s2">influences more people than the politics</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.140" end="01:26:07.590" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference all of that falls</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.740" end="01:26:09.850" style="s2">under an umbrella of like governments</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.590" end="01:26:12.880" style="s2">the one who does a lot of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.850" end="01:26:14.920" style="s2">stuff in crypto about this crypto people</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.880" end="01:26:16.360" style="s2">I find just using that word governance I</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.920" end="01:26:24.520" style="s2">realized that crypto people talk about</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.360" end="01:26:27.690" style="s2">this all the time and they talk yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.520" end="01:26:27.690" style="s2">maybe this is kind of a solution</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.790" end="01:26:37.380" style="s2">too bad people thought they were there</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.620" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">was power there and ruined Krypton you</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.380" end="01:26:44.430" style="s2">have to figure out the humans are</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:45.930" style="s2">fundamentally economic creatures you</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.430" end="01:26:49.050" style="s2">have to figure out how to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.930" end="01:26:55.830" style="s2">incentives are aligned for everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.050" end="01:26:57.330" style="s2">produce quality the initial hope of</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.830" end="01:26:59.160" style="s2">social media was the users would</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.330" end="01:27:01.710" style="s2">regulate content quality by likes and</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.160" end="01:27:04.680" style="s2">upvotes yeah I guess I think is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.710" end="01:27:06.240" style="s2">that naive I don&#39;t think so I mean 10</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.680" end="01:27:09.930" style="s2">years ago I don&#39;t think that was naive I</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.240" end="01:27:10.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe 10 but I don&#39;t know 20</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.930" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">years ago yeah I don&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.980" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">naive at all</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.270" end="01:27:24.980" style="s2">well everyone wants a good tailor</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.660" end="01:27:36.050" style="s2">the problem is that the good part and</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.160" end="01:27:38.030" style="s2">dictatorship suffers from sets of</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.050" end="01:27:39.410" style="s2">problems that democracy campus I mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.030" end="01:27:40.700" style="s2">there are some problems that are better</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.410" end="01:27:41.690" style="s2">handled indicator ships though some</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.700" end="01:27:44.030" style="s2">problems that have better handled in</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.690" end="01:27:46.580" style="s2">democracies but this isn&#39;t even I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.030" end="01:27:49.040" style="s2">talking more about a new politics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.580" end="01:27:51.410" style="s2">not talking about oh if only we&#39;d elect</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.040" end="01:27:58.100" style="s2">the Green Party or the blue party or the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.410" end="01:27:59.720" style="s2">red party know the system the substrate</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.100" end="01:28:05.990" style="s2">on which they&#39;re playing is</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.720" end="01:28:07.700" style="s2">fundamentally broken yeah the good</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.990" end="01:28:09.910" style="s2">dictatorship that kid that takes over I</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.700" end="01:28:12.110" style="s2">mean that&#39;s not the classic problem</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.910" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">Plato would have hated like some up</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.110" end="01:28:21.340" style="s2">close something something that I really</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:21.340" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.670" end="01:28:38.590" style="s2">what Oh I&#39;m streaming but that died yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.940" end="01:28:41.570" style="s2">who knows whatever Plato&#39;s Academy</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.590" end="01:28:42.920" style="s2">apparently like Pythagoras found like</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.570" end="01:28:44.570" style="s2">five hundred people who want to learn</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.920" end="01:28:48.220" style="s2">math well I put them up in a building</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.570" end="01:28:51.080" style="s2">and called it like yeah the Pythagorean</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.220" end="01:28:53.480" style="s2">forget what he called it but that kind</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.080" end="01:29:00.920" style="s2">of stuff okay we could do that again</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.480" end="01:29:02.450" style="s2">today here&#39;s the thing about science do</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.920" end="01:29:07.300" style="s2">you believe inside so you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.450" end="01:29:10.130" style="s2">believe in science people who you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.300" end="01:29:13.300" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in nuclear physics still</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.130" end="01:29:13.300" style="s2">get blown up by the bomb</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.870" end="01:29:26.950" style="s2">to Sparta of engineering yeah it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.930" end="01:29:30.460" style="s2">bad idea right you know I had to agree I</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.950" end="01:29:32.780" style="s2">got it I gotta read more that stuff oh I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.460" end="01:29:36.710" style="s2">wish I wish I could I wish I could focus</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.780" end="01:29:40.490" style="s2">more and read more stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.710" end="01:29:43.930" style="s2">maybe connect he&#39;s riding our brands</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.490" end="01:29:43.930" style="s2">with everyone saying about these days</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.340" end="01:29:52.040" style="s2">do you think the world will always be</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.540" end="01:29:54.079" style="s2">full of inequalities I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.040" end="01:29:58.070" style="s2">stupid thing to focus on I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.079" end="01:30:00.199" style="s2">bad we should focus on the sum sum of</p>
