<p begin="00:30:47.040" end="00:30:51.850" style="s2">notice how we&#39;re in dashcam mode with</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.570" end="00:30:53.800" style="s2">unsupported car right now yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.850" end="00:30:56.170" style="s2">actually okay we&#39;re just gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.800" end="00:30:58.690" style="s2">add a fingerprint which is gonna be less</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.170" end="00:31:01.730" style="s2">annoying and I hope calibration process</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.690" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s got a calibrated but</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.730" end="00:31:05.990" style="s2">so there&#39;s a tool in self-drive debug</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:08.750" style="s2">called get fingerprint let&#39;s just get</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.990" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">the fingerprint for the car I think this</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.750" end="00:31:11.720" style="s2">works alright perfect this is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:17.299" style="s2">fingerprint this easel this is the</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.139" end="00:31:26.210" style="s2">go into one self-drive where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.850" end="00:31:27.380" style="s2">fingerprints go in like saw your cables</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.210" end="00:31:29.419" style="s2">probably part of your family that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.380" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">right oh yeah we will fix that in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.419" end="00:31:35.690" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:38.990" style="s2">get grap fingerprints where are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.690" end="00:31:43.789" style="s2">fingerprints oh it&#39;s in let&#39;s just go in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.990" end="00:31:49.899" style="s2">here to car Toyota values yeah yeah here</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.789" end="00:31:49.899" style="s2">they are alright so we have a Corolla</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:57.220" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna mm see okay the only</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.100" end="00:32:02.330" style="s2">one we actually support here is the O</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.220" end="00:32:03.889" style="s2">rav4 2019 I say you know what for now</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.330" end="00:32:07.190" style="s2">let&#39;s just hack it and add it to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.889" end="00:32:09.529" style="s2">Corolla hatch the same car we actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.190" end="00:32:12.769" style="s2">don&#39;t support the 2020 coral which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.529" end="00:32:17.230" style="s2">copy and paste this fingerprint into</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.769" end="00:32:17.230" style="s2">this convenient Python file here</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.960" end="00:32:23.720" style="s2">now let&#39;s restart manager and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.550" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to get any more dashcam</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.720" end="00:32:28.370" style="s2">bullshit in before we get some more</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:30.050" style="s2">dashcam bullshit if we get more - damn</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.370" end="00:32:36.980" style="s2">bullshit we&#39;ll fix it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.050" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">genius hackers ok starting manager these</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.980" end="00:32:40.610" style="s2">guys saw this last time don&#39;t break it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:42.830" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna break it don&#39;t work no</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.420" end="00:32:48.560" style="s2">okay guys successfully reflashed if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.340" end="00:32:49.880" style="s2">had unplugged it not like a split second</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.560" end="00:32:52.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance we would have break</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.880" end="00:32:54.010" style="s2">down now that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.310" end="00:32:57.670" style="s2">devastating okay good</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.010" end="00:33:01.550" style="s2">we rebooted we&#39;re connected to the Panda</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.670" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">everything looks good can&#39;t see ya know</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.290" end="00:33:19.350" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be in - camera let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:20.760" style="s2">look at the code and see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.350" end="00:33:23.429" style="s2">happening by the way you&#39;re running chat</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.350" end="00:33:30.679" style="s2">perfect now let&#39;s get advice to run that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:38.970" style="s2">a hat should have that where is - down</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.580" end="00:33:43.380" style="s2">mode and when do we go into us when do</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.970" end="00:33:45.570" style="s2">we choose - but notice how it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.570" end="00:33:52.530" style="s2">probably just because we have weird</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.160" end="00:33:54.690" style="s2">internal controls live alerts so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.530" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">just looking reducing the screen this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.690" end="00:34:00.390" style="s2">pretty good this is useful it&#39;s a wind -</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:05.670" style="s2">come out so this is when it&#39;s throwing</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.390" end="00:34:08.330" style="s2">an alert of startup no control so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.670" end="00:34:11.820" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.330" end="00:34:14.910" style="s2">startup no control and not controller</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.820" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">available why is there no controller</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.910" end="00:34:24.170" style="s2">available maybe there&#39;s some other thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:26.670" style="s2">and not understanding get startup alert</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.170" end="00:34:30.379" style="s2">so this is a new stuff that&#39;s going to</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.090" end="00:34:48.210" style="s2">a switch</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.260" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">I think think that that that that thing</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.740" end="00:37:18.130" style="s2">didn&#39;t start hacking the code to fix</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.090" end="00:37:19.750" style="s2">that that was incredible - cam oh I wish</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:21.099" style="s2">it actually told you that your switches</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.750" end="00:37:22.660" style="s2">were in the wrong orientation I mean</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.920" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">lanes but this is a brand new car we</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:26.329" style="s2">a week tuning it it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.780" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">par with autopilot it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.329" end="00:50:29.660" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:32.060" style="s2">um autopilot is a little more almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.660" end="00:50:34.750" style="s2">aggressive and how they like market</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.060" end="00:50:37.590" style="s2">things and want to do things</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.750" end="00:50:37.590" style="s2">big targets</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.789" end="00:50:45.749" style="s2">and we used to have a six minute timeout</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.749" end="00:50:51.509" style="s2">needed to touch the wheel but now if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.049" end="00:50:53.700" style="s2">see this little icon here the little</p>
