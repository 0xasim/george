<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.869" style="s2">is start writing up a lot of technical</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.109" end="00:25:33.129" style="s2">like you should program and you should</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.759" end="00:25:34.450" style="s2">practice programming but it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.129" end="00:25:36.549" style="s2">it&#39;s studying right it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:57.070" style="s2">start documenting our code better how a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.700" end="00:25:59.710" style="s2">lot of the stack works better writing</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.070" end="00:26:02.529" style="s2">like high quality but somewhat dry</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.580" end="00:29:32.290" style="s2">working on this week thinking envision</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.010" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">features right when you think and your</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.290" end="00:29:37.450" style="s2">brain about driving you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:39.940" style="s2">about you don&#39;t think of pictures</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.450" end="00:29:42.280" style="s2">you think features so we have a great</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.940" end="00:29:43.900" style="s2">vision model a bunch of coffees and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.280" end="00:29:46.030" style="s2">we&#39;re building these models auto encoder</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.900" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">decoder you can you can visualize it all</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.030" end="00:29:50.620" style="s2">we got to put that we gotta put that on</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:54.790" style="s2">Twitter that looks cool I love impatient</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.620" end="00:29:59.530" style="s2">model dynamics model hardware people I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.790" end="00:30:01.450" style="s2">mean maybe our new again if you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.530" end="00:30:03.610" style="s2">hardware and you can also code yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.450" end="00:30:07.680" style="s2">we&#39;re interested if you just do hardware</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.610" end="00:30:07.680" style="s2">and can&#39;t code and I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.530" end="00:30:15.049" style="s2">let&#39;s see oh yeah and this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.060" end="00:30:16.940" style="s2">like show you guys</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.049" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">so this is one of the things I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.940" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.210" end="00:30:34.830" style="s2">so what this is here this is the how</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.500" end="00:30:36.600" style="s2">this is the box that open pilot is using</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.830" end="00:30:38.220" style="s2">in order to drive and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.600" end="00:30:40.230" style="s2">visualization model from the vision</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.220" end="00:30:42.029" style="s2">features so I trained an autoencoder</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.230" end="00:30:47.340" style="s2">to take the vision features and bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.029" end="00:30:48.990" style="s2">them back up to an image this is what it</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.340" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2">looks like when it&#39;s a video you see how</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.990" end="00:30:56.309" style="s2">that thing appeared there look at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:30:57.690" style="s2">lane change so this is how open pilots</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.309" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">actually seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.690" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re gonna start doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:14.010" style="s2">more stuff what we think in these vision</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:15.690" style="s2">features right you&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.010" end="00:31:21.210" style="s2">something interesting up here when a car</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.680" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">then we just take the features and bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.120" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">them back to the image space</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.090" end="00:32:09.349" style="s2">I&#39;ll show you guys another thing</p>

<p begin="00:43:15.519" end="00:43:19.450" style="s2">to solve self-driving cars remember the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:21.430" style="s2">mission of the company is to solve</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.450" end="00:43:23.950" style="s2">self-driving cars while delivering</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.319" end="00:43:43.960" style="s2">hire people for well so do more</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.500" end="00:43:45.759" style="s2">engineers solve the problem more</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.960" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">engineers are only good if you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.759" end="00:43:50.589" style="s2">different things that need doing right</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.450" end="00:44:23.079" style="s2">self-driving cars then having more</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.549" end="00:44:24.819" style="s2">software engineers definitely helps</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.079" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">right another way to think about this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.819" end="00:44:31.559" style="s2">on dolls law right like problems are</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:31.559" style="s2">parallelizable to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.630" end="00:44:36.820" style="s2">this is a classic it&#39;s um like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.920" end="00:44:51.390" style="s2">succeed if you train a simulation say</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.340" style="s2">the stuff all the time don&#39;t wanna so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.390" end="00:44:55.260" style="s2">write it all up write it all up the real</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.340" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">solution to self-driving which I pull uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.260" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">Sebastian thrown and start at Udacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:00.510" style="s2">course for self-driving right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.070" style="s2">Sebastian throws like Shimon was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.510" end="00:45:03.480" style="s2">take him in the ten years to solve I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.070" end="00:45:06.990" style="s2">out I&#39;ll just train the people who did</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.480" end="00:45:08.550" style="s2">it right what I think about mapillary</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.990" end="00:45:10.140" style="s2">getting bought by Facebook well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.550" end="00:45:12.210" style="s2">the end of mapillary right who bought</p>
