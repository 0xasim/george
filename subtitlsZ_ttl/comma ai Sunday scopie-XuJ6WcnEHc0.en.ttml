<p begin="00:03:13.600" end="00:03:17.580" style="s2">more comfortable with self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:21.010" style="s2">this is disgusting and everybody sees it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:23.230" style="s2">I know maybe this is a lot of complaints</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.010" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">about the media these days okay so</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.840" end="00:03:42.849" style="s2">little bad for them because they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">constrained by the Google brand people</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.069" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">also in Weibo so I find me I find the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.470" end="00:04:07.270" style="s2">way more advertising to be particularly</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">like this is over violent effectively</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.010" style="s2">they could have literally run open pilot</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.490" style="s2">they talk about how it&#39;s 99% in</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">um when 99% autonomous mode would mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.380" end="00:06:26.910" style="s2">they do have a huge screen that does a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">big Russian screen no but um 99 percent</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.910" end="00:06:32.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean anything because it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">great paper that just came out about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.060" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">Drake Equation they talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:41.100" style="s2">difference between point estimators and</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.100" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">up with massively different results for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.750" end="00:06:47.100" style="s2">the Drake Equation which I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">really cool you guys can check out that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.100" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">paper I did some some favorite physics</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:57.390" style="s2">guys name I can&#39;t remember I should I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:07:03.410" style="s2">should shout it out properly no no</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.169" end="00:07:14.520" style="s2">before but um they can&#39;t use GPS because</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.990" end="00:07:16.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not reliable in Russia I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.520" end="00:07:18.210" style="s2">Russia has their own GPS is called</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.199" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">GLONASS and to tell our reliable in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:23.279" style="s2">Russia though GLONASS a little thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:25.590" style="s2">about GLONASS GPS is narrowband</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.279" end="00:07:32.249" style="s2">of GLONASS is wideband and it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.590" end="00:07:34.919" style="s2">much harder to do precise very precise</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.249" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">stuff because the ionosphere has</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.919" end="00:07:39.449" style="s2">different delay times for different</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:41.249" style="s2">frequencies for GPS all the GPS</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.009" end="00:07:48.599" style="s2">say that so cool I think GPS does work</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.370" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">pretty well in Russia we have pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.599" end="00:07:52.139" style="s2">good global coverage you can also</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:53.879" style="s2">probably get the BAE do satellites</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.139" end="00:07:56.909" style="s2">bay-do uses the same frequency as GPS</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:05.219" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.349" end="00:08:07.499" style="s2">idea where would I put the mirrors know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.219" end="00:08:10.199" style="s2">you&#39;ll see what the solution is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.499" end="00:08:11.849" style="s2">probably what you expect in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.199" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">to anything that requires that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.849" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">cameras but guys a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:16.649" style="s2">disengagement sweer still getting an</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.899" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try to really drive</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:29.189" style="s2">source of disengage now is cutting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.669" end="00:08:31.349" style="s2">there are visible cuttings so open pilot</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.510" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">the auto pilot cars you see all the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.579" end="00:08:47.730" style="s2">they crash into things in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:50.490" style="s2">and this is the same bug because you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.730" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">can&#39;t just trust and we&#39;ll get to why we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.490" end="00:08:55.319" style="s2">don&#39;t use lidar in a minute you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.140" end="00:08:57.060" style="s2">just trust the radar because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.319" end="00:09:00.449" style="s2">radars will detect like manhole covers</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.060" end="00:09:02.010" style="s2">or bridges as stopped cars and if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.449" end="00:09:04.139" style="s2">guys in the Toyota sometime will</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.010" end="00:09:06.569" style="s2">experience false braking so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.139" end="00:09:09.060" style="s2">trade-off right a false positive means</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.569" end="00:09:10.920" style="s2">hard braking but a true positive means</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:12.060" style="s2">you crash into something right so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.920" end="00:09:14.639" style="s2">want to get hit from the front of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.060" end="00:09:17.560" style="s2">back so you got it you got to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.639" end="00:09:20.920" style="s2">tune these things it&#39;s a no-win scenario</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.560" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">the aschen marui why don&#39;t we use</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.920" end="00:09:25.900" style="s2">lighter so um the problem thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.270" end="00:09:29.580" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.900" end="00:09:33.640" style="s2">the problem with lidar is twofold one</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.580" end="00:09:35.020" style="s2">it&#39;s very expensive you if you what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.640" end="00:09:36.520" style="s2">show me what lidar you can buy today</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.020" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">that&#39;s reasonably priced and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.520" end="00:09:40.870" style="s2">point I don&#39;t look I can buy the slider</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:42.580" style="s2">for five hundred dollars but just</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.870" end="00:09:44.260" style="s2">because they&#39;re both called lidar it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.580" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">nothing like the kind of lidar you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.260" end="00:09:48.820" style="s2">find on lame-o cars so you say twelve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:52.180" style="s2">thousand which light are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.820" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">about and let me also remind you at</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.180" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">twelve thousand you can for twelve</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:58.810" style="s2">thousand dollars you can buy twelve Eon</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">giraffe panda combinations that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.810" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">midnight black eons</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.900" style="s2">maybe maybe normally on grey panda</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">giraffe with international shipping so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.900" end="00:10:12.010" style="s2">you can buy twelve exactly there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">certain control changes that can address</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.010" end="00:10:19.900" style="s2">that let them yeah vision mark radar</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:22.089" style="s2">yeah those things we can do better there</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.900" end="00:10:24.580" style="s2">why can&#39;t lie to our be made in mass</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.089" end="00:10:28.180" style="s2">scale for much cheaper so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.580" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">fundamental reason that it can&#39;t but no</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.180" end="00:10:31.210" style="s2">companies have done it yet all right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:33.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna spin up the comma a I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.210" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">lied our division and try to make lidar</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.520" end="00:10:36.310" style="s2">it makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">Oster twelve thousand dollars is still</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">too much money now so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">aspect to it um you know could you make</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:44.890" style="s2">ladders cheaper yeah someone probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">well and then at that point we can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.890" end="00:10:49.690" style="s2">can reevaluate our usage of lidar I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">show you a Bosch radar image not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.690" end="00:10:53.740" style="s2">exactly we mean by that ladder will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">cheap is still five thousand is still</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.740" end="00:10:57.430" style="s2">too much and then there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:11:00.220" style="s2">question of I&#39;m not sure what you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">lighter gets you right lidar doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.220" end="00:11:05.170" style="s2">tell you how to drive a car all lidar</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">gives you is a depth based point cloud</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.170" end="00:11:09.550" style="s2">of an environment you can do very</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:11.310" style="s2">similar things today using even a single</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.550" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">camera combined with deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.310" end="00:11:21.520" style="s2">obviously you can use let&#39;s find mono</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">cam depth that&#39;s right yeah that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.520" end="00:11:23.889" style="s2">mean by the $500 liners that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:32.129" style="s2">really what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.889" end="00:11:43.509" style="s2">what um so this one good this one&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.129" end="00:11:44.589" style="s2">there&#39;s very good ones now let me find</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.509" end="00:11:47.339" style="s2">the cityscapes</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.589" end="00:11:47.339" style="s2">yep tonight</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.650" end="00:11:55.800" style="s2">so my point is lidar is pretty similar</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">to a camera plus a depth now we used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:12:02.010" style="s2">troll that we were going to put make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:08.460" style="s2">box with a GPU and a camera and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.010" end="00:12:10.440" style="s2">sell it as a lidar so you see the depths</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.460" end="00:12:12.900" style="s2">there that are being returned as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.440" end="00:12:17.000" style="s2">believe this is mono cabin might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.900" end="00:12:17.000" style="s2">stereo cabinets it&#39;s all very similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.060" end="00:12:24.330" style="s2">yeah like you can infer depth this depth</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">ground truth was probably taken with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.330" end="00:12:30.270" style="s2">liner and this is uh without the liner</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">you see this is even picking up on some</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.270" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">things that are not in the ground truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:37.350" style="s2">like that tree over there oh yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">not really sure why what you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.350" end="00:12:40.170" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get with a liner</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:42.090" style="s2">I mean the more expensive liners do with</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.170" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">higher resolutions they still don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.090" end="00:12:45.300" style="s2">resolutions that even come close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.470" end="00:12:48.090" style="s2">cameras so we have a thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.300" end="00:12:51.390" style="s2">dollar lidar at , it&#39;s a thirty two line</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.090" end="00:12:52.710" style="s2">lidar and it spins and it takes I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.390" end="00:12:55.500" style="s2">about a hundred thousand points per</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.710" end="00:12:57.150" style="s2">second so for comparison we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.500" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">the camera on your eon at one megapixel</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.150" end="00:13:01.470" style="s2">well actually three megapixels to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.420" style="s2">precise we&#39;re really running into three</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.470" end="00:13:05.510" style="s2">megapixels is how we do the RGB things</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.420" end="00:13:09.840" style="s2">but three megapixels it runs at 20 Hertz</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.510" end="00:13:11.460" style="s2">so that&#39;s 60 million data points we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.840" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">getting 60 million data points instead</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.460" end="00:13:14.670" style="s2">of a hundred thousand from lidar so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:17.460" style="s2">you&#39;re getting six hundred times more</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.670" end="00:13:21.150" style="s2">data with the EON than you do with even</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.460" end="00:13:23.220" style="s2">a thirty thousand dollar lidar so wider</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.150" end="00:13:25.380" style="s2">is one of these things again is this way</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.220" end="00:13:28.230" style="s2">Mo&#39;s advertising why does everybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.380" end="00:13:31.710" style="s2">think like lidar is important it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.230" end="00:13:33.300" style="s2">really not I&#39;m now we&#39;re lidar will do a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.710" end="00:13:34.680" style="s2">great job is in localization you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.300" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">localize yourself very precisely and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.680" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">light our maps with a lie are this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.600" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">like the entire strategy of cruise</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">automation for example absolute</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">automation has built their core</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">technology was a very precise lidar slam</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve built a ladder map of San</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.430" style="s2">Francisco and then they can localize</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:52.430" style="s2">themselves in it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.540" end="00:14:01.550" style="s2">any more questions this is Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:05.899" style="s2">sculpey where we answer your questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:11.029" style="s2">you ask them we answer them why do</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.899" end="00:14:12.649" style="s2">people want to ask about we can also go</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.029" end="00:14:13.879" style="s2">through self-driving cars and see what</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.649" end="00:14:15.400" style="s2">else oh well</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.879" end="00:14:20.740" style="s2">so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.400" end="00:14:23.110" style="s2">Wow Volvo premises self-driving 2021</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.740" end="00:14:25.510" style="s2">xc90 you can ask guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.110" end="00:14:28.180" style="s2">whenever you see stories like this the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.510" end="00:14:31.420" style="s2">engineers probably were not asked right</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.180" end="00:14:33.430" style="s2">so um how many I is a company built by</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.420" end="00:14:40.420" style="s2">engineers run by engineers controlled by</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.430" end="00:14:42.430" style="s2">engineers this is a marketing story in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.420" end="00:14:50.080" style="s2">lot of companies you have a structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.430" end="00:14:51.370" style="s2">that looks something like this we can</p>
