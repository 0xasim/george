<p begin="00:03:03.320" end="00:03:12.730" style="s2">up suffix trees this is cuz this is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:12.730" style="s2">a common thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.069" end="00:03:32.549" style="s2">hundred-plus why does where stream</p>

<p begin="00:04:11.870" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">oh it&#39;s not 100 plus it&#39;s just hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.629" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">plus I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.780" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">okay so I mean so I looked over this</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.640" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">paper a bit more this morning it turns</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:36.670" style="s2">out that this paper describes things</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">that are incredibly simple in the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.670" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">complicated way you can believe like</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">this denotes the probability right but</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">all this stuff says is that it&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:51.640" style="s2">0 &amp; 1</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:54.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s a real number like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.640" end="00:04:56.350" style="s2">knows that about it probabilities you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.190" end="00:05:00.070" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say that right and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.350" end="00:05:01.450" style="s2">like this whole thing has an integral in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.070" end="00:05:03.400" style="s2">it and you&#39;re like what the fuck&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.450" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">integral I don&#39;t know but then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.400" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">realize that it&#39;s actually just this so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:08.350" style="s2">when you realize it&#39;s just this you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:13.270" style="s2">realize that we have the wrong numbers</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.350" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">here so yesterday I had these set at 1 &amp;</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.270" end="00:05:20.050" style="s2">2 and you&#39;ll see that with 1 &amp; 2</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">let&#39;s just see that with 1 &amp; 2 I get 50</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.050" end="00:05:26.290" style="s2">200 bytes of entropy but then if I use</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">that cough geek romanov estimator it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.290" end="00:05:40.350" style="s2">goes down to 5,000 so if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">remember get a gzip is down at 37 angry</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.350" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">yeah I mean I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that like</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">I really don&#39;t think these people wrote</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:50.830" style="s2">it to be like oh I&#39;m smart I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">that&#39;s just like how they think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.830" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">we&#39;re just sensible I guess I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.180" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of not used to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.140" end="00:06:09.510" style="s2">yeah mathematical rigor no one should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.950" end="00:06:15.510" style="s2">better at that well how do you learn to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.510" end="00:06:19.590" style="s2">be mathematically rigorous guys okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.510" end="00:06:21.480" style="s2">when you read this whole thing um you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.590" end="00:06:27.570" style="s2">realize that it&#39;s memory less and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.480" end="00:06:31.850" style="s2">memory lists is just doesn&#39;t uh means it</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.570" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even depend in the past yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.850" end="00:06:37.170" style="s2">what else piss me off about this the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:38.910" style="s2">things start from one things start from</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.170" end="00:06:42.660" style="s2">one I think MATLAB does that too and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why these people do that okay can</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.660" end="00:06:46.050" style="s2">be defined with the source Melanie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:49.470" style="s2">memory a finite variable or by our</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.640" end="00:06:59.610" style="s2">page I&#39;ve never actually written the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:01.290" style="s2">suffix tree but I&#39;ve definitely read</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.610" end="00:07:03.150" style="s2">this Wikipedia and seen this banana</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.290" end="00:07:09.150" style="s2">example multiple times and convinced</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.150" end="00:07:16.740" style="s2">always questionable I probably copy and</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.780" end="00:08:24.370" style="s2">mean s this is complete if every the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2"> does that word mean semi infinite</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.370" end="00:08:31.880" style="s2">talk too much it&#39;s just semi infinite oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:35.390" style="s2">um I&#39;m gonna look that up</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.880" end="00:08:39.080" style="s2">what&#39;s a semi infinite mean however I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.560" end="00:13:58.410" style="s2">not sure if these things are just</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.850" end="00:14:07.860" style="s2">because they care about efficiency let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.410" end="00:14:11.959" style="s2">try to understand here&#39;s banana the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.860" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">sixth path from the root to the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.959" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">correspond to the suffixes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:26.930" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s an an that&#39;s banana</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.879" end="00:14:59.829" style="s2">we can just write the stupid thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.350" end="00:15:01.179" style="s2">quickly I think so buy the stupid thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.829" end="00:15:04.600" style="s2">I mean like we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll put these</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.179" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">in a tree structure now we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.600" end="00:15:09.999" style="s2">a roof node and then these will go back</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:14.069" style="s2">there and we can increment each one in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.999" end="00:15:14.069" style="s2">the tree structure like going back</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.579" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.100" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">oh man ya know I&#39;d see my I be I be made</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.730" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">really understand what a suffix tree is</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.890" end="00:16:15.310" style="s2">interesting so I was looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.460" end="00:16:18.190" style="s2">backwards but because this is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.310" end="00:16:20.440" style="s2">to be looked at backwards it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.190" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">proper if no string and ass has a suffix</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.440" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">of any other string and ass</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.619" end="00:18:32.119" style="s2">values now it can have one point six</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.200" end="00:18:35.989" style="s2">possible values which that gets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.119" end="00:18:37.730" style="s2">interesting but you know if that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.240" end="00:27:15.830" style="s2">ferry still took forever but like if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.600" end="00:27:17.570" style="s2">were in the West Valley National Park</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.830" end="00:27:19.810" style="s2">you totally could have swam from there</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.500" end="00:27:30.990" style="s2">that looks really small discomfort while</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.730" end="00:27:39.909" style="s2">okay the other option is we could go</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.470" end="00:27:41.559" style="s2">around no I looked it up I might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.909" end="00:27:57.909" style="s2">wrong about this this is a site I really</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.559" end="00:28:03.429" style="s2">like Rome to Rio and the problem is your</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.909" end="00:28:10.029" style="s2">choices are to fly or to take bus this</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.429" end="00:28:11.649" style="s2">does not sound like a fun bus but do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.029" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">really want to be on some eleven in or</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.649" end="00:28:17.590" style="s2">bus okay well actually that road doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.590" end="00:28:26.490" style="s2">buses and uh they now have GPS world</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.279" end="00:28:26.490" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.170" end="00:28:42.130" style="s2">no no this body alright back to work</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.440" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">okay so the only question is like are</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.120" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">these strings reversed or not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">what I&#39;m not quite understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.250" end="00:29:11.179" style="s2">and every suffix set</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.950" end="00:29:28.779" style="s2">as I said to be proper if no string Nass</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:31.979" style="s2">is the suffix of any other string and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.779" end="00:29:42.039" style="s2">that&#39;s okay so how do you do that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.979" end="00:29:49.299" style="s2">say I have one string and then later I</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.039" end="00:29:52.919" style="s2">have this so that&#39;s fine because neither</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.299" end="00:29:55.989" style="s2">string is the suffix of another drink</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.919" end="00:29:59.589" style="s2">but like this string wouldn&#39;t be okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.989" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">because that&#39;s the suffix of that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.589" end="00:30:07.139" style="s2">then at that rate unless I get identical</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:07.139" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.159" end="00:30:18.740" style="s2">unless I literally get identical things</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.779" end="00:30:18.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.169" end="00:30:51.399" style="s2">busses okay all right</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.900" end="00:32:28.850" style="s2">I guess we actually want to generate all</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.850" end="00:32:38.200" style="s2">sense we want to add all suffixes of</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.350" end="00:32:57.000" style="s2">you can just pick this tall suffix trees</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.020" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">of course it&#39;s a tree having more</p>

<p begin="01:42:01.550" end="01:42:08.480" style="s2">use it yeah look at that look at that</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.660" end="01:42:10.910" style="s2">new record I let&#39;s go up to 16 let&#39;s add</p>

<p begin="01:42:10.910" end="01:42:15.670" style="s2">that hate when I delete stuff that later</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.340" end="01:42:15.670" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.600" end="01:42:42.080" style="s2">I&#39;m at an isotonic drink almost I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.850" end="01:42:55.699" style="s2">a green tea and the only good thing is</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.080" end="01:42:58.520" style="s2">that the compressor kind of works yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.699" end="01:43:02.000" style="s2">know I know I wrote this before get</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.520" end="01:43:05.679" style="s2">history course not</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.000" end="01:43:05.679" style="s2">tell I have an old get history</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.019" end="01:43:35.349" style="s2">Oh guys guys did we just beat dude did</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.579" end="01:43:39.929" style="s2">we just be gzip we just be gzip oh oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.349" end="01:43:47.400" style="s2">hello this crushing it bros</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.929" end="01:43:47.400" style="s2">absolutely crushing it bros look at that</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.550" end="01:43:54.670" style="s2">look at that</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.150" end="01:43:55.809" style="s2">35 bytes of entropy oh yeah go we go</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.670" end="01:43:57.989" style="s2">more will be even better</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.809" end="01:43:57.989" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.050" end="01:44:09.400" style="s2">Bros Bros that was the easiest I</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.219" end="01:44:11.230" style="s2">love is gonna be hard I don&#39;t even use</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.400" end="01:44:14.260" style="s2">their waiting I got it all the way</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.230" end="01:44:17.349" style="s2">down to pay all the way down sir no</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.260" end="01:44:19.960" style="s2">ma&#39;am now to be fair the only way to</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.349" end="01:44:23.260" style="s2">really know whether a compressor has</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.960" end="01:44:25.869" style="s2">bugs in it or not is to actually create</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.260" end="01:44:27.460" style="s2">the compressed file and then decompress</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.869" end="01:44:28.570" style="s2">the file right because if you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.460" end="01:44:31.329" style="s2">that you don&#39;t actually know if it has</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.570" end="01:44:35.409" style="s2">bugs give me one sec you know what guys</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.329" end="01:44:38.079" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do I&#39;m gonna run</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.409" end="01:44:39.429" style="s2">out and let&#39;s see what foods around here</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.079" end="01:44:40.179" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna come back we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.429" end="01:44:47.199" style="s2">actually gonna write the arithmetic</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.179" end="01:44:51.159" style="s2">coder uhm but yeah we&#39;ll just say dat</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.199" end="01:44:53.260" style="s2">ratio bro so yes we&#39;ve written a better</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.159" end="01:44:56.619" style="s2">compressor than gzip and how much lines</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.260" end="01:45:00.639" style="s2">of Python now know better is an</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.619" end="01:45:07.119" style="s2">interesting and well this is all crap we</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.639" end="01:45:09.610" style="s2">don&#39;t use that so in in 70 lines of</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.119" end="01:45:14.249" style="s2">Python we&#39;ve written a better compressor</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.610" end="01:45:17.530" style="s2">than gzip using context tree waiting now</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.249" end="01:45:19.449" style="s2">the reason why better is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.530" end="01:45:22.360" style="s2">subjective is because I&#39;m sure it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.449" end="01:45:24.010" style="s2">lower than gzip gzip is not really</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.360" end="01:45:26.139" style="s2">designed to be great compression gzip</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.010" end="01:45:28.360" style="s2">just wanted to be fast I&#39;m good I lick</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.139" end="01:45:33.289" style="s2">the paper just search for context tree</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.360" end="01:45:38.360" style="s2">waiting maybe maybe I&#39;ll throw that out</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.289" end="01:45:40.219" style="s2">I&#39;ll put a paper therapy and then you</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.360" end="01:45:43.670" style="s2">can you guys can go my github yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.219" end="01:45:45.139" style="s2">just there&#39;s a lot of stuff that it Wow</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.670" end="01:45:54.230" style="s2">a lot of people have implemented this I</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.139" end="01:45:55.579" style="s2">guess I didn&#39;t even know Dan just search</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.230" end="01:45:58.130" style="s2">for contracts tree waited miss lots of</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.579" end="01:46:00.769" style="s2">stuff yeah we&#39;ll be back we&#39;ll be back</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.130" end="01:46:06.469" style="s2">and maybe give me give me give me ten</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.769" end="01:46:09.050" style="s2">minutes twenty minutes and then we will</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.469" end="01:46:15.409" style="s2">implement the arithmetic code hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.050" end="01:46:16.309" style="s2">oh yeah such good compression such good</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.409" end="01:46:19.849" style="s2">compression growth</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.309" end="01:46:20.329" style="s2">I seen a bit ma&#39;am it was good it was</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.849" end="01:46:23.210" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.329" end="01:46:25.369" style="s2">I had banana roti and it came with curry</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.210" end="01:46:27.139" style="s2">but it was weird to dip it in the curry</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.369" end="01:46:30.829" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t really dip it in the curry I</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.139" end="01:46:32.690" style="s2">kind of wanted to get some tosai to dip</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.829" end="01:46:36.079" style="s2">in the curry but like I stood there with</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.690" end="01:46:38.900" style="s2">the menu open and I kind of just got the</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.079" end="01:46:42.050" style="s2">vibe there like who was this guy why the</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.900" end="01:46:43.699" style="s2"> is he into a restaurant so that was</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.050" end="01:46:46.880" style="s2">kind of the vibe I got so I&#39;m gonna wash</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.699" end="01:46:50.409" style="s2">my hands cuz I touched money and I ate</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.880" end="01:46:52.539" style="s2">food touch my life laughter you know oh</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.409" end="01:46:56.869" style="s2">I got this</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.539" end="01:46:59.000" style="s2">this was 1:30 Riggins it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.869" end="01:47:02.530" style="s2">ripoff usually they&#39;re a dollar but the</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.000" end="01:47:02.530" style="s2">roti was a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.870" end="01:47:36.650" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna write an arithmetic coder</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.460" end="01:47:43.000" style="s2">oh yes what&#39;s your awake I got some</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.650" end="01:47:43.000" style="s2">technically you&#39;re into entropy decoder</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.849" end="01:48:07.290" style="s2">ah so let&#39;s see if we can do this I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.790" end="01:48:12.090" style="s2">little bit tired but we&#39;ll enjoy our</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.290" end="01:48:16.800" style="s2">best how long they&#39;ve walking some</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.090" end="01:48:19.710" style="s2">monkeys today and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.800" end="01:48:26.310" style="s2">Australians and I mean like actual</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.710" end="01:48:28.099" style="s2">monkeys sometimes yo you like what</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.310" end="01:48:37.889" style="s2">Australians go out to party and drink</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.099" end="01:48:40.079" style="s2">while monkeys been let&#39;s like pick like</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.889" end="01:48:52.050" style="s2">a reasonable number that&#39;s like 10 is 10</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.079" end="01:48:55.909" style="s2">a reasonable number okay um so the</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.050" end="01:48:55.909" style="s2">basics of how arithmetic coding works</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.340" end="01:49:05.210" style="s2">broken No</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.319" end="01:49:19.599" style="s2">guys is not racist</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.179" end="01:49:21.969" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m Australian and a good good good</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.599" end="01:49:24.189" style="s2">should we go there should we go we</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.969" end="01:49:25.780" style="s2">talked about how according to some new</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.189" end="01:49:28.239" style="s2">definitions you&#39;re not you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.780" end="01:49:32.699" style="s2">can&#39;t be racist against white people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.239" end="01:49:32.699" style="s2">not nuts Hanna believable but you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.030" end="01:49:45.669" style="s2">now but you have you ever seen if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.789" end="01:49:47.199" style="s2">ever seen a group a group of Australians</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.669" end="01:49:49.569" style="s2">when they when they come to like one of</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.199" end="01:49:52.629" style="s2">these islands to party and then they</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.569" end="01:50:07.499" style="s2">were in the hostel that just just just</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.629" end="01:50:10.209" style="s2">crazy it&#39;s for a while</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.499" end="01:50:13.749" style="s2">racism was acceptable only if it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.209" end="01:50:17.159" style="s2">I like that snot funny you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.749" end="01:50:17.159" style="s2">that was funny</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.680" end="01:50:42.770" style="s2">okay so the way that it works</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.900" end="01:51:04.230" style="s2">this is even more complicated because</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.170" end="01:51:33.770" style="s2">I also thinking about what if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.640" end="01:51:38.870" style="s2">wrong there but wait so this is P of X</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.770" end="01:51:38.870" style="s2">so that&#39;s nice we actually need P of 0</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.059" end="01:52:22.469" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.619" end="01:52:41.170" style="s2">that&#39;s P of X Q 0 and P of X so what we</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.610" end="01:52:54.020" style="s2">actually need is the probability range</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.170" end="01:52:58.369" style="s2">that it&#39;s in so if X is 1 the range is</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.020" end="01:53:01.400" style="s2">going to be from P of X to 1 else</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.369" end="01:53:07.099" style="s2">the range is gonna be from 0 point 0 to</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.400" end="01:53:10.059" style="s2">P of X now yeah this is this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.099" end="01:53:10.059" style="s2">arithmetic oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.630" end="01:53:23.679" style="s2">the idea is you just put that range you</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.530" end="01:53:23.679" style="s2">scale that range by your current range</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.900" end="01:53:34.670" style="s2">and then once things get too small you</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.119" end="01:53:37.360" style="s2">have to you like to have to quantize the</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.670" end="01:53:37.360" style="s2">probabilities</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.110" end="01:53:59.360" style="s2">hmm quantize them anyway</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.550" end="01:54:14.410" style="s2">for those of you who missed the date</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.840" end="01:54:17.830" style="s2">thing you missed the date thing you got</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.410" end="01:54:26.980" style="s2">to watch the earlier stream you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.830" end="01:54:30.810" style="s2">get to know if the date was discussed in</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.980" end="01:54:30.810" style="s2">detail on the earlier stream</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.250" end="01:54:43.020" style="s2">yeah this this is this</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.020" end="01:55:38.000" style="s2">hmmm it&#39;s cute</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.619" end="01:55:45.010" style="s2">so this is just normal arithmetic coding</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.599" end="01:55:46.540" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing special about this like</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.010" end="01:55:51.239" style="s2">I do have I have probabilities I have a</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.540" end="01:55:51.239" style="s2">model which it cold</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.690" end="01:56:09.440" style="s2">the definition are starting to work well</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.990" end="01:56:09.440" style="s2">guys want to see outside</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.400" end="01:56:19.860" style="s2">I&#39;d wear my denim jacket this morning</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.860" end="01:56:27.489" style="s2">okay</p>

<p begin="01:57:00.989" end="01:57:32.989" style="s2">right so let&#39;s round P of x equals P of</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.090" end="01:57:32.989" style="s2">x times T six doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.120" end="01:58:02.180" style="s2">oh yeah so it cost us two bytes if we</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.680" end="01:58:02.180" style="s2">round to the nearest 256</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.770" end="01:58:36.260" style="s2">so isn&#39;t there a python class calling</p>

<p begin="02:41:54.100" end="02:42:02.920" style="s2">not right but what we really want to do</p>
<p begin="02:41:56.050" end="02:42:07.449" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re recursing back through</p>

<p begin="02:42:44.301" end="02:42:53.150" style="s2">so I could return the whole list</p>
<p begin="02:42:47.570" end="02:42:54.801" style="s2">and then compute it afterwards or is</p>
<p begin="02:42:53.150" end="02:42:57.040" style="s2">there just a cute recursive way to do</p>

<p begin="02:45:31.480" end="02:45:37.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s effectively that that should</p>

<p begin="03:02:04.671" end="03:02:08.961" style="s2">I don&#39;t know people like think this</p>
<p begin="03:02:05.931" end="03:02:12.160" style="s2">stuff out more well they just kind of</p>
<p begin="03:02:08.961" end="03:02:12.160" style="s2">try things until it works</p>
<p begin="03:02:16.830" end="03:02:21.490" style="s2">where people like sit down with like</p>
<p begin="03:02:18.939" end="03:02:25.390" style="s2">paper and try to figure things out maybe</p>
<p begin="03:02:21.490" end="03:02:29.850" style="s2">I should do that instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="03:02:25.390" end="03:02:29.850" style="s2">keep this in my head that sounds boring</p>
<p begin="03:02:32.790" end="03:02:36.850" style="s2">yeah so then whenever we can remove</p>
<p begin="03:02:34.990" end="03:02:46.350" style="s2">precision from these fractions we want</p>
<p begin="03:02:36.850" end="03:02:46.350" style="s2">to show it that means</p>
<p begin="03:03:20.530" end="03:03:28.050" style="s2">a fraction sucks losing as a way to</p>
<p begin="03:03:25.300" end="03:03:28.050" style="s2">think about things</p>
<p begin="03:03:28.850" end="03:03:32.200" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="03:03:39.730" end="03:03:44.311" style="s2">well the problem really is this</p>
<p begin="03:03:41.650" end="03:03:44.311" style="s2">multiplication</p>
<p begin="03:05:10.970" end="03:05:19.819" style="s2">let&#39;s find a reason to fractionate right</p>
<p begin="03:05:14.270" end="03:05:19.819" style="s2">here we&#39;ll say self dot d x equal 36</p>
<p begin="03:05:23.779" end="03:05:53.789" style="s2">here we want to do less equals t 0 but</p>
<p begin="03:05:44.489" end="03:05:58.020" style="s2">we have to rescale these to the old so</p>
<p begin="03:05:53.789" end="03:06:01.699" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole problem I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="03:05:58.020" end="03:06:01.699" style="s2">to scale them and just be trivial</p>
<p begin="03:06:21.290" end="03:06:24.979" style="s2">oh god I shouldn&#39;t do this and see what</p>
<p begin="03:06:23.660" end="03:06:27.130" style="s2">you have to deal with like the fact the</p>
<p begin="03:06:24.979" end="03:06:27.130" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="03:06:49.670" end="03:06:52.989" style="s2">so this was easier</p>
<p begin="03:06:54.061" end="03:07:00.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s so easy in theory but then you</p>
<p begin="03:06:57.690" end="03:07:00.920" style="s2">have to deal with finite precision</p>
<p begin="03:07:20.190" end="03:07:26.400" style="s2">can I keep the denominator something</p>
<p begin="03:07:22.680" end="03:07:30.510" style="s2">reasonable when you multiply fractions</p>
<p begin="03:07:26.400" end="03:07:35.370" style="s2">you multiply the numerators and multiply</p>
<p begin="03:07:30.510" end="03:07:37.410" style="s2">denominators right good I don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="03:07:35.370" end="03:07:39.590" style="s2">that you multiply fractions does that</p>
<p begin="03:07:37.410" end="03:07:39.590" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="03:07:44.420" end="03:07:49.290" style="s2">yeah you multiply fractions you multiply</p>
<p begin="03:07:47.940" end="03:07:53.101" style="s2">the numerators new month with</p>
<p begin="03:07:49.290" end="03:07:56.820" style="s2">denominators you subtract fractions okay</p>
<p begin="03:07:53.101" end="03:08:01.470" style="s2">so you&#39;re self-taught range range</p>
<p begin="03:07:56.820" end="03:08:12.680" style="s2">numerator equals subsidy myself that age</p>
<p begin="03:08:01.470" end="03:08:12.680" style="s2">range denominator which equals D</p>
<p begin="03:08:16.320" end="03:08:25.410" style="s2">okay then we want to want to rescale p0</p>
<p begin="03:08:22.470" end="03:08:31.400" style="s2">to be in that range so we want to</p>
<p begin="03:08:25.410" end="03:08:33.720" style="s2">multiply p0 times the range numerator</p>
<p begin="03:08:31.400" end="03:08:49.980" style="s2">multiplied the denominator times the</p>
<p begin="03:08:33.720" end="03:08:51.930" style="s2">range to nominate it so right okay the</p>
<p begin="03:08:49.980" end="03:08:54.140" style="s2">denominators are gonna get huge fast but</p>
<p begin="03:08:51.930" end="03:08:54.140" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:09:07.720" end="03:09:16.080" style="s2">getting negative numbers again</p>
<p begin="03:09:11.500" end="03:09:16.080" style="s2">I hate negative numbers</p>
<p begin="03:09:50.181" end="03:10:14.971" style="s2">okay so we take p0 put into the range we</p>
<p begin="03:10:13.771" end="03:10:25.921" style="s2">can just multiply it by the range</p>
<p begin="03:10:14.971" end="03:10:28.101" style="s2">numerator three fourths so there are</p>
<p begin="03:10:25.921" end="03:10:33.021" style="s2">five nine eighty three fourths</p>
<p begin="03:10:28.101" end="03:10:33.021" style="s2">this is the same thing as 9 over 16</p>
<p begin="03:11:00.990" end="03:11:12.320" style="s2">okay so now if X is zero then we want to</p>
<p begin="03:11:09.540" end="03:11:12.320" style="s2">set too high</p>
<p begin="03:11:34.399" end="03:11:37.850" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="03:11:38.751" end="03:11:41.621" style="s2">and think</p>
<p begin="03:11:46.159" end="03:11:53.069" style="s2">yeah guys I&#39;m tired real asleep we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="03:11:49.770" end="03:11:56.399" style="s2">this more tomorrow they&#39;ll make it work</p>
<p begin="03:11:53.069" end="03:12:05.869" style="s2">when guys are watching my live bat and</p>
<p begin="03:11:56.399" end="03:12:05.869" style="s2">try to make it work yeah later</p>
