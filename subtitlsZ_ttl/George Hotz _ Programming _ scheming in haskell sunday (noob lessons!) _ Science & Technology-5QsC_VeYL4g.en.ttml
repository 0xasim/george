<p begin="00:00:27.920" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">i think it like takes a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:36.559" style="s2">propagate and that&#39;s why</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">looks like we have some relatively low</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">tier</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">questions and comments</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">um in here</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">i did watch some landing congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">so now that we&#39;re done with the bagel</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">on the last stream</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">uh i read the comments briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">i think it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">tragedy that we can&#39;t trust any</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">institutions anymore</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">um it&#39;s sad that that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">uh universities journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">political these institutions are just</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">so unequipped um to deal with the modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">and they are not adapting well</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">so like paul graham said</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">i&#39;m excited for the people who are going</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">to come in and build new institutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">um it&#39;s not that way not to trust them</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just that i don&#39;t respect them</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t respect i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">the new york times to say good things</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">about me i don&#39;t respect the new york</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t want an honorary degree from</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">yale university i don&#39;t respect yale</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">who do i respect a bunch of random</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">people on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">satoshi nakamoto</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">vitalik eliezer yukowski scott alexander</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">uh paul graham um</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a smattering of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">individuals elon musk who can be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">and i think are adapting to the modern</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">world in an okay way</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">while these institutions remain so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">incredibly tone deaf</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">uh to the fact that we&#39;re not interested</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">in being lied to anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">i also the only other comment i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">is non-constructive proof</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">um there&#39;s a stack overflow if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">can link that to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">um if somebody can link that to me i</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">will go over that proof</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">because i realized that i didn&#39;t go over</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">the proof uh at all i just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">glossed over it and once i understood it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">and then i realized that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">understand it totally the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">thought i did so if somebody could link</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">to that proof</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">this is the desert identity right</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">thank you hype train um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">does someone want to uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">want to link to that i know it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">comment but we don&#39;t get youtube</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">comments anymore</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">uh there&#39;s no more youtube comments in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">my browser they went away</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">i did make decent revenue from the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">stream i did um</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">so if nobody&#39;s gonna link to it then um</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">not here um so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">r uh equals the square root of n</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">is integral uh if rational uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">for n uh exists in it so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to show here is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">r is a rational number it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">a integral number so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">we start with okay so r is some fraction</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">a over b</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">um the greatest common divisor of a b at</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">one which means it&#39;s a reduced fraction</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">and then this is the bayesian identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">this is something that has to be true</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">now if you&#39;ll notice this jump to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">next step</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">um so if you look here uh a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">minus br times c plus dr if you take</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">a over b and you substitute it in here</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">uh the b&#39;s cancel out so you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">with a minus a which is zero</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s zero times uh c dr which</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">obviously equals zero</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">um and then you can take</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">uh this</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">um and you guys should remember foil</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">from algebra to multiply your firsts um</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">your inners uh your outers</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s plus dra and then your lasts</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">which is brdr but actually you&#39;ll notice</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">r times r um is defined</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">to be n all right so we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">just change that to bdn</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">um so we&#39;re left with ac</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">minus bdm uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">minus brc minus dra</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">so we can factor an r out of here</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">um let&#39;s let&#39;s just flip these around</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">all right it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">um so we can factor an r out of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">uh d a minus bc</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">but we know that da minus bc equals one</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">so we&#39;re left with replace that with one</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re left with uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">what&#39;s written here now ac</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">well considering b and c are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">integers</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">c is also an integer so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">integer</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">this has to be an integer obviously n n</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">is an integer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">defined to be a natural number so</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">because these are both integers</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">and we know zero is an integer i mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">another way we can just write this</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">is zero equals b d n minus r equals v</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">minus a c</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">right so uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">uh so yeah i did promise it was a noob</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">stream so we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna go</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">the other thing that i wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">about was i found a bug</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">in my busy beaver code and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">producing</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">i shouldn&#39;t have been lazy you guys</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t let me uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">get away with with laziness</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">so this is from the busy beaver streams</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">where i implemented</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">the zany zoo paper um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">so you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to i</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have gotten away with being</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">like oh i know what&#39;s right even though</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">my numbers don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.279" style="s2">if your numbers don&#39;t match the paper</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.279" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">95 of the chance you&#39;re wrong maybe five</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">percent chance the paper is wrong if</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">you&#39;ve really looked over it</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">but um of course we&#39;re in the 95 bucket</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">i had a bug</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">so these are the number of states that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">we should be generating</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">uh for the given sizes in their tree</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">normal form</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">so this has been pushed to github</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">if you go in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">36 for two by two</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">three five zero eight for three by two</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">two seven six four for two by three</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">one of my biggest mistakes was this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">when i added in these other states even</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">though they&#39;re overwritten later on</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">i didn&#39;t make a copy of the machine and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">not making a copy of the machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">caused these num states and num symbols</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">to be incremented erroneously so once i</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">made a copy a lot of that bugs were</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">fixed now</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">i&#39;m still not getting a perfect match</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">for four and two</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">so i wonder if i still have a bug um</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">this one is giving me five one one one</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">six two uh do two and four</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">i think this one gives me three four two</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">thirty two and they&#39;re very close um so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">one of the things i found</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">was i set this bound on the number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">steps to 200</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">if i change it to 100</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">i get a perfect match with paper</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">but when i change it back to 200 which</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">is what they claimed in the paper i</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t get a perfect match</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m not exactly sure what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">here but it&#39;s nice to see my numbers be</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">a whole lot closer to the papers</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">you aren&#39;t done until you&#39;ve matched the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">paper perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">of course i&#39;m still not done because i</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t matched the paper perfectly but</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">remember when they claimed that the 5x2</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">machine was getting this many</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">my implementation got this when we ran</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">it over on the server</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">now i got this so uh that&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">closer to what the paper said</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">uh you created a copy before but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">deleted yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">maybe because i thought like it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">matter uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">because i was like oh i overwrite it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">i forgot that all these things have side</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">but we will program in a language where</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">there are no side effects</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">in haskell and i think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">um stream</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">so scheme is a programming language</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be writing a scheme</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">interpreter in haskell that gets you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">kind of to what the truth uh programming</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">languages are</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">i want to talk about one other comment</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">that i read it was like george</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">you can teach people they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">able to teach themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">oh that&#39;s another kind of thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">was thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for me to teach like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s very hard for me to teach</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">like okay the twitch comments are twitch</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">comments from from hundreds of random</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">people are not really a good uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">audience for lectures one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">that i think that would work a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">is if we brought one person onto the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">stream and taught them a specific</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">topic and then if you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:33.840" style="s2">teach somebody something</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">i think the best way to do is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.840" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">socratic method style</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">right you make sure you check their</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">understanding at every step</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">um because a lot of times when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">learning something</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">uh you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">and then by</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">being being asked to do something and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">realize i remember i remember being in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">third grade</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">and um my uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">it was in second grade second grade and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">going to put me up a grade for math and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">i spoke with the third grade teacher</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">and she asked me george do you know your</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">multiplication tables</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">um and uh i said yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">and then she asked me some questions she</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">asked what&#39;s 6 times 6 and i said 36</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">and she asked me what&#39;s 8 times 8 and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">said 64.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">and then she asked me what 6 times 8 and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know 6 times 8</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">because i actually just knew the squares</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">i didn&#39;t actually know i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">that you could multiply besides</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">multiplying numbers by itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">um so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">yeah we could potentially take vips we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">could also potentially say it&#39;s like 100</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">for 30 minutes uh might be another</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">option</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">so we can either charge money or we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">have a merit-based</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">thing uh those are the two things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">it is acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:54.880" style="s2">to discriminate upon in a modern society</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">you can discriminate based on</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.880" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">uh paying money or you can discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">based on skill</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">don&#39;t charge you&#39;ll get banned from</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">twitch you guys are always so</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know about making your own</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">stream server i think there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">um do we have to ban someone yeah always</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">always be</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">yeah i know i can show my earnings but</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">um we&#39;ll stream on a voice app</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">if i die i die that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the philosophy lanalocks</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">thank you for bringing your people in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">and i think that is a perfect time</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">to actually get started on the stream</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">although the majority of modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">programming files see algo style lifts</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">lisp syntax is simple using the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">syntax to represent code and data the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">this is called homo iconicity i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">if a program written in it can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">manipulated as data using the language</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">such the pro i don&#39;t know i mean python</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">has like an ast import ast</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">um a scheme a dialective lisp is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.400" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">straightforward we won&#39;t follow the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">strict</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">scheme standard for stake of brevity but</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">aim to include many useful features</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">why haskell because this guy loves</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">haskell okay that&#39;s good to know</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">um what are we gonna do we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">a very basic but robust programming</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">language that is both simple to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">and highly extendable is that how you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">spell that word i don&#39;t think that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">you spell that word</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">no it has an a um</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">so this is some basics of lisp uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.279" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">understanding check what form does</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">scheme use to represent data</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">um the same one that it uses for code oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">man i should have paid more attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">how would you create a function lambdas</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">you can use lets for setting variables</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">scheme is a dynamically typed</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">interpreted functional language</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">c is a statically typed compiled</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">imperative language</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">yeah can you rearrange lead expressions</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">into lambda</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so you can definitely put</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:25.039" style="s2">lambdas into lets</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">um write out an explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.039" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">example that demonstrates using lexical</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">scope while the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">things are only scoped when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">inside the lambda so i think most of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">those answers questions or answers are</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">right but some of them are probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">you guys can make fun of me in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">before we start there&#39;s a note i have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">make before we start i&#39;m going to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">a time to complain about string</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">uses overloaded strings and all files so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">i advocate</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">text this is the strong position on text</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i&#39;m already questioning</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">this tutorial</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">um from from a word being spelled wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna go with it i</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">ago um but this is i don&#39;t like i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">so rmd um most high school tutorials on</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">good good this looks this looks much</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">more approachable</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.399" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">let&#39;s start with main.hs</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">module main where import system dot</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">crap main has</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">type i o i know types when i see them do</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">args equals get args uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">put sterling hello</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">environment correctly if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">import the environment you get nothing</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">all right cool we got a program</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">oh it&#39;s not okay index too large because</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">we&#39;re taking a zero with arc hello hello</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">hello</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">um the type declaration</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">type declaration the io type is an</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">haskell will ever give you a straight</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">answer to what a monad is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell you all this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">how it&#39;s like grounded in some</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">you know seventh level math man but</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">maybe this is more to say a value is of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">type moan added the class is to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain type of extra</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">attached to this value most functions do</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">not need to worry about these pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">the extra information the i o actions is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">to be performed using the carried along</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">well the basic value</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">when attached with information is void</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">represented as that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">okay both i o string and i o parentheses</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">parentheses belong to the same i o monet</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">there&#39;s two ways to create an i o action</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">all right this is what a do block is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">like puts the monad stuff together</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">precedence of haskell stuff okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to parsing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">oh we&#39;re gonna need a parser or cabal</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">install parsec</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">drive no it&#39;s 18 days old</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">you&#39;re asked to install executables but</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">there are no executables perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">want to use lip</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">well let&#39;s just hope this works</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">hiding spaces yeah i mean because like</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">spaces is like like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">what&#39;s ghc main.hs dot slash main</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">okay gotta compile um</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">we&#39;ll define a symbol which is a parser</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">char all right that seems kind of nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">all right so symbol is just anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">there and then we&#39;re going to write a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">read exper</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">let&#39;s type this one out read expert</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">to string read expert input</p>

<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">can i like put my read expert what if i</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">put my read expert here</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">that do something</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">no no match list oh it&#39;s trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">match the word lisp</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">unexpected l or i guess i can only parse</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">these things so if i put like a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why we had to hide spaces so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">can add a spaces type</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">now this is all using the parsec library</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">which i mean this is the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">where we could dive into exactly what it</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">uh we touched briefly on the bind</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">we mentioned it was used behind the</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">block</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">here we use it to combine our white</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">however bind has different semantics in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">the parser and i o yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">can be based on whatever the uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">type is okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">so we&#39;re back to defining uh lispval</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">going on in the haskell community about</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">whether string or text is the one true</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">like get the noobs early no no string is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">the one true string oh no it&#39;s slower</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">yeah watch me n squared concatenate my</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">strings together in python and not</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">care um number</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">pool pool all right that seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">um this is an example of an algebraic</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">data type it sold a set of possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">values of type list val</p>

<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">cool all right so we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">a thing that parses par</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">string and i guess parser</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">list vowel so the output is a list bell</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">do char so if it&#39;s a string we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">to get a char</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">here x mini</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">none of backslash</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s for like uh association</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">alright cool all right par string</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">parse adam we can just copy and paste</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">and then um in haskell when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">pattern matching like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">uh this just means match anything</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s easiest to read this backwards</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">since both function application and</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">types get the stronger you can make</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">documentation kind of automatic</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">well i mean that&#39;s sad but um</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">we&#39;d like to construct a number list</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">spell from the resulting string but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">have a few type mismatches</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">first we use the built-in function read</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">to convert that string into a number</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">then we pass the result to number which</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">is this thing up here to get a lisp val</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">function composition operator creates a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">function that does both together</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">oh okay unfortunately the result of many</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">digits is still a parser string</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">so our combined number reads still can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">operate on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">we need a way to tell it to operate on</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">the value inside the monad</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">lift m does exactly that so let&#39;s try a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">little experiment</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">well oh we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">import control monet and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">try a little experiment where we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">if we get a tight mismatch if i get rid</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">of that lift then</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">i mean i should</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">inside this so this is the monad that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s inside of and lift</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">m is applying this function see i never</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">okay question am i learning right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not really sure right</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">i think they have exercises at the end</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">of these and we&#39;ll do the exercises to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">make sure we really</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">you know check my understanding um</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:38.319" style="s2">because like i can say this but i never</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">would have known</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">if i had gotten this error i would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">been like i lift am i i wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">guessed that right</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">um cool so there&#39;s some uh things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">gonna have to think in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">um this hasn&#39;t been thinking yet this</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">has just been typing</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">parser list val</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">so parse expression just seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">combination</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ll move this down here since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">a combination of the previous three</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">parse atom</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">parse string or parse number we can get</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">any one of these and it&#39;s all an expert</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">um so i guess we want to yeah we want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">want to find read experts so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">calling this spaces symbol thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll call parse expert and i guess lisp</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">is just like the name of the top token</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">um yeah well so i don&#39;t need val here</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually not used</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s see if i just make it true</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">does that work yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">um rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">parse number okay well let&#39;s double</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:55.839" style="s2">check</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look okay that works</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.839" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">rewrite parse number</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">with outlift m</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">using do notation and explicit</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">sequencing</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">with the oh wow i&#39;ve never seen that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">operator before</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">but let&#39;s think about how to do this so</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">how do i write a comment again with</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">haskell</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">comments weird well that doesn&#39;t work uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">there are just two dashes i can do</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">single line comments yeah okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">um using do notation</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.440" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">and explicit sequencing so what if i</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">just say something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">do uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">first many one</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">digit or i say like x and then i say</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">something like return</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">this uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">well so what do i want to do i want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">read x</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">and then i want to call number on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">i think i can actually just that does</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">um yeah so how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">cool my god does the same thing um</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how to do explicit</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">sequencing with this operator i guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">they want me to write another one but</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">yeah that seems it seems right um so i</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">can also</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">just show like that&#39;s equivalent i can</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">uh because i left a parenthesis there</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.839" style="s2">cool cool but i think i think our first</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">check your understanding went pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t really care about this type</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t really get um i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">don&#39;t care about that one</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">we did half of it our strings aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">that gives a literal quote character</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">instead of terminating the string</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">oh change parse number to support the</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">add a character and a float constructor</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">uh you guys in the comments decide which</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">one we want to do here i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">do them all we&#39;ll do one</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">full numeric tower well that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">a lot uh you guys can choose from two to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">six</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">and then whichever one people like will</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.839" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">all right what are we saying six all</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">right all right i see a lot of votes for</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">float</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">let&#39;s do float uh add a float</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">constructor to lisp val</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">okay so i think we can say float float</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">where is haskell haskell float type</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">oh they&#39;re 12 doubles or something i</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see first let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">that works okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">so we expect something like 3.4 to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:01.119" style="s2">compile</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">oh it already compiled well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.119" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">somewhat concerning</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">what did it parse us</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">it would be helpful if we had a way to</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">print these i think there is a type</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">what if i you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">found val plus plus show val it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">be like oh you can&#39;t show a list valve</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">um how do i make my custom type showable</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">haskell make type</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">showable</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">no instance from show this val it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">a way to do this though</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">oh import debug.trace and then use trace</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">m</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">string thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">do you have an associative problem any</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">friends there</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">no trace tray</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">bob</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">driving show okay all right let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">that approach</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">sorry tracem</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">uh driving shell</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">like that oh hell yeah that works okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:55.839" style="s2">found value number three</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:59.040" style="s2">oh so i guess it just parsed that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.839" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a little annoying</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.040" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">what&#39;s going to take precedence</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">parse float do</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">many digits</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">why many digits</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">uh let</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:39.760" style="s2">atom equals</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">no this isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.760" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a way i can like get that whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.839" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">i should do i think i can sequence them</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">and then the haskell function read float</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.359" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">might be useful</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">so i guess that&#39;s the same then as this</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:14.559" style="s2">so we&#39;ll just copy and paste this and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">change that to read</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.559" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">float and we&#39;ll call the float</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">constructor instead of the number</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">constructor</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll add it here so we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">parse float as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">variable not in scopy hey probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">because i need to like import it or</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">numeric dot read float orders need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:42.319" style="s2">import numeric</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">no module named numeric is important</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.319" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">import</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">numeric</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">couldn&#39;t match type float with</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">actual type double string</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how i feel about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">why is it a string oh read float must do</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">some fancy</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">reads an unsigned</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">real frack</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">is that the wrong read float</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">no i&#39;m starting to write read flow</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">yeah hugo</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">so we want something that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">take in a float taking a string</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">and return a float isn&#39;t that right</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">floatmer maybe he&#39;s not a haskell type</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">maybe doubles the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">read double oh this is from some bio</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">library though</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">well actually i should be able to type</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">read float into google and it&#39;ll tell me</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">oh god what&#39;s a red s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">reads an unsigned real fraction</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.040" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know reed didn&#39;t have these</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">a parser for type a and returns a set of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">possible pairs</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">can you put a show there no of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">not there are like ways to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">uh see something that&#39;s annoying about</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">haskell how do i debug</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">i think i can just use read as long as i</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.599" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">can infer that i&#39;m parsing a float okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">let&#39;s try it</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">ground value float 4.0 great well that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">wasn&#39;t exactly the float that i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">eh</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">i mean i guess it parsed this and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">well all right let&#39;s first do a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">test what if i do string x all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">that should</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">why did it get a four where&#39;d it get</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">oh it like didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t concatenate</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">so reed might actually be correct but</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">i have a problem here with my</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">concatenation</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.839" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">so like let atom equals x colon colon</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">y or plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">um there&#39;s probably a better way to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">write this</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">let atom equals and then we&#39;ll check to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">make sure it&#39;s working as a string</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t want that we want that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.960" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">okay now it&#39;s saying 3.4 so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">float read adam let&#39;s go cool</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">do i need that i don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.839" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">oh we don&#39;t want to ignore hs</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">drops the intermediate values is there a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">way not to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">you can try with a tight hole to debug</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">your types</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve seen that before thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">subscribing</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">my philip 3 um</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">cool all right we now have float support</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">uh next we&#39;re going to add a few more</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">parser actions</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">uh so we should be able to parse a list</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">parse list is a parser this vowel</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">parse list uh this is using the lift m</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">syntax again</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">but i think we&#39;re pretty comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">uh sep by this must be parsec stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">parse x first braces okay the parse</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">expert this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">down here in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:01.760" style="s2">uh the dotted parser list is slightly</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">parse dotted list is a parser list bound</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">do we already have</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">support for these things yes we do in</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">our algebraic data type oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.839" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:19.920" style="s2">i&#39;m going to start getting some scheming</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">soon parse expert spaces</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.920" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what end buy is maybe does</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">google support parsec</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">yeah n by parses zero more</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">okay that&#39;s fine yeah zero more and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">i get it</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">separated and ended bicep</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:48.880" style="s2">uh char</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">spaces yeah so it really is only doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.880" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s only doing the parse expert these</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">are being thrown away</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">and that was my bug and that&#39;s why i had</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">to write that but i&#39;m sure you can write</p>

<p begin="01:07:34.319" end="01:07:39.200" style="s2">what is this note how we can sequence</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.200" end="01:07:44.960" style="s2">and then yeah that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">the sequence returns a parser and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.960" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">combining that with a parse expert as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">parser list val exactly the type we need</p>

<p begin="01:08:11.520" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t evaluate it okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen this before</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">um and then oh what&#39;s the structure and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.040" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">interpretation of computer programming</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:24.239" style="s2">yeah you know would be really cool if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:29.440" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.239" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">book um it&#39;s a free book too i believe</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">so this is a thing written in scheme i</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.880" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">just want to quickly look at it and see</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">if the scheme</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">looks uh similar to my scheme</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">oh no i do have it here structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:09:00.080" style="s2">interpretation key program is cool</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">um yeah i went through this a bit when i</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.080" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">was playing with backspace</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.839" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">yeah this looks like my scheme we should</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.239" end="01:09:16.799" style="s2">try we should try some of the examples</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:18.319" style="s2">from this book</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.799" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">in the scheme just so we know that what</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.319" end="01:09:22.319" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is not like</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">you know some it&#39;s something real that</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.319" end="01:09:27.920" style="s2">exists outside</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:29.679" style="s2">of just being in this tutorial</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.920" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s not all made up it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.679" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">programming boys</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">real programming uh structure</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:36.159" style="s2">interpretation computer programming is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">like uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.159" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">one of the freshman books at mit um</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">i think it&#39;s pretty good remember if the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">book&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.759" end="01:09:48.319" style="s2">let&#39;s say if the book came from earlier</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">than 2000 it&#39;s probably good i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.319" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">survive this long</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.239" end="01:10:12.159" style="s2">finally let&#39;s add</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:13.760" style="s2">our definition to parse expert to</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.159" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">include the new parsers but</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.760" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">put the parse expert calls the things</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">which also calls</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">parks expert that&#39;s too much that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.120" end="01:10:25.679" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">man it&#39;s too much it&#39;s too recursive</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.679" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">will this ever terminate you can&#39;t prove</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:32.480" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">oh man this would be so terrible see</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.480" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;d be so terrible to doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:36.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:38.080" style="s2">something non-turn complete like</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.560" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">like i&#39;d have to show that this</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.080" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s recursive right parse list</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">calls parse expert which you can call</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">parse list</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">so you have to show that the total</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">number of unconsumed characters is</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">what what is this spam</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.320" end="01:12:28.560" style="s2">x all right so we should now be able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.120" end="01:12:32.480" style="s2">parse a list i believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.560" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">misty oh no</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.480" end="01:12:38.159" style="s2">unexpected space oh no i think my floats</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">broke it</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.159" end="01:12:42.080" style="s2">my floats broke it we&#39;re gonna put the</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">float down there and it fixes it</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:45.679" style="s2">but then i don&#39;t think my floats work</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.679" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">yeah i think um</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">maybe try parse float</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.239" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">yeah yeah remember that you gotta do try</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">yo sometimes you just gotta try now</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:08.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">all right that&#39;s nice all right we can</p>

<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s bring up our structure</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:14.159" style="s2">computer programs</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:15.280" style="s2">um and like see if we can like do things</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.159" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">like that i don&#39;t think so because i</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.280" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can do symbols yet</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:23.199" style="s2">um whoops</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:23.199" style="s2">sorry</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.480" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">i think we can even parse 2.7 and 10</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.719" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">thanks to you guys choosing floats</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.840" end="01:13:47.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">who&#39;s spamming mods can we take</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.840" end="01:14:45.280" style="s2">lists found</p>

<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">i kind of hate back quotes because that</p>

<p begin="01:19:09.280" end="01:19:14.800" style="s2">cool so we can just have parser here</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.080" end="01:19:24.320" style="s2">unexpected single quote didn&#39;t i write</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.840" end="01:19:25.679" style="s2">single quote oh did i not include parse</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.320" end="01:19:27.199" style="s2">quoted</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.920" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">beginnings of an evaluator primitives</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.960" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">okay cool so</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">let&#39;s go put this in a different can i</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">put in a different file</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">i know how to do that so we won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.159" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">that just put it here</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:27.360" style="s2">we&#39;ll write a couple comments data types</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.600" end="01:20:35.440" style="s2">here we&#39;ll put parser</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:47.679" style="s2">and here we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:51.360" style="s2">eval eval takes in a lisp vowel</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.679" end="01:20:54.639" style="s2">and it returns a lisp val eval</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.360" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">val at what does the at do</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.639" end="01:21:00.320" style="s2">the notion val at string</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">matches any lisp vowel that&#39;s a string</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.320" end="01:21:03.120" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.719" style="s2">binds val to the whole list val and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.120" end="01:21:06.000" style="s2">notches the contents of the string okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.719" end="01:21:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s cute</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.000" end="01:21:11.120" style="s2">so this is a normal like uh what are</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.880" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">these things called</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.120" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">this is like a type matching</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:18.960" style="s2">comprehension there&#39;s a real name for</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:22.480" style="s2">but if it&#39;s a string it matches that one</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">if it&#39;s a number</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.480" end="01:21:27.280" style="s2">it matches this one it&#39;s a bool it</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:29.840" style="s2">matches this one</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.280" end="01:21:30.960" style="s2">and if it&#39;s a c but now this one&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.840" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">to be different we&#39;re not going to use</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.960" end="01:21:36.080" style="s2">the add syntax</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">if we have a quote val then we just</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.080" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">val which i don&#39;t exactly understand</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.840" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:50.000" style="s2">the quote means like make it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:50.000" style="s2">that and don&#39;t evaluate it</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.320" end="01:21:58.639" style="s2">quote yeah return through without</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.120" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">evaluating it</p>

<p begin="01:23:04.800" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">when we change our main function to read</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:13.440" style="s2">an expression</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">get args uh oh wow this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.440" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">oh no get args</p>

<p begin="01:23:24.159" end="01:23:28.880" style="s2">don&#39;t even need to change this that much</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.520" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">i can just do eval here can i</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.880" end="01:23:38.880" style="s2">uh like x equals eval expert</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">oh no i want to do read exper read</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.880" end="01:23:43.600" style="s2">expert expert and then we can just put</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:47.600" style="s2">out the thing that we evaluated</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.600" end="01:23:51.360" style="s2">cool could not match type</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.600" end="01:23:55.120" style="s2">io string with type list val</p>

<p begin="01:23:55.120" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">show there and then we want</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.239" end="01:24:04.480" style="s2">read expert to return a lisp vowel</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.719" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">oh that&#39;s cute so now the string is</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.480" end="01:24:10.480" style="s2">actually an error in the language</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s nice all right</p>

<p begin="01:24:48.080" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">just say eval</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">uh read expert expert and we don&#39;t put x</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.840" end="01:25:00.800" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.199" end="01:25:03.760" style="s2">oh no we&#39;re gonna need a show we need a</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:03.760" style="s2">show that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.000" end="01:25:16.000" style="s2">i had a show there though um</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.159" end="01:25:17.600" style="s2">read expert expert yeah that&#39;s good cool</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.000" end="01:25:20.080" style="s2">uh so now it&#39;s going through if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.600" end="01:25:24.000" style="s2">notice my quote here went away</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.080" end="01:25:25.040" style="s2">because of this uh pattern match here in</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.000" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">my email</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.040" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">cool that&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.239" end="01:25:32.560" style="s2">um oh yeah now things are getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.679" end="01:25:35.679" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.560" end="01:25:38.800" style="s2">watch this boys watch this if we try to</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.679" end="01:25:40.560" style="s2">like add two plus two in our scheme</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.800" end="01:25:42.080" style="s2">yeah non-exhaustive patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.560" end="01:25:43.760" style="s2">function eval because we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.080" end="01:25:47.040" style="s2">have to implement</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.760" end="01:25:47.760" style="s2">a plus and now it&#39;s time to implement a</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.040" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">plus</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.760" end="01:25:51.600" style="s2">so if we have a list with an atom func</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:53.600" style="s2">and then args</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.600" end="01:25:54.880" style="s2">so what this is doing is this takes the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.600" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">item from the list this is the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:02.159" style="s2">the list</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:05.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to apply is apply a haskell</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.159" end="01:26:09.280" style="s2">built-in i think it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.840" end="01:26:11.520" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.280" end="01:26:11.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.520" end="01:26:22.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t really get it but whatever</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.199" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">apply funk map</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.239" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">eval args</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.679" end="01:26:32.800" style="s2">well oh no i gotta write apply</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">uh so actually you know what let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.800" end="01:26:38.800" style="s2">try to write apply without reading ahead</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:41.920" style="s2">so we want to apply this is an</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.800" end="01:26:45.760" style="s2">atom a list val</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.920" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to return a list val</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.760" end="01:26:55.520" style="s2">if the atom is atom plus</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:27:00.080" style="s2">um no this is actually a list here</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.520" end="01:27:00.080" style="s2">is that this the syntax for lists</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:05.840" style="s2">um equals</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:14.159" style="s2">so like x and we can say number</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.280" end="01:27:14.159" style="s2">some x</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.719" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">uh not in scope</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.800" end="01:27:25.920" style="s2">well let&#39;s just try that for now</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:27.840" style="s2">not in scope adam uh yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.920" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">wait what why is adam not in scope i</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.840" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.080" end="01:27:43.360" style="s2">list adam plus</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.840" end="01:27:48.400" style="s2">non-exhaustive patterns in function eval</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.600" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.400" end="01:27:55.120" style="s2">so that matches that pattern oh</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not an atom it&#39;s a funk is</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.120" end="01:27:58.639" style="s2">actually being taken here so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:00.480" style="s2">actually a string</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.639" end="01:28:03.520" style="s2">so we don&#39;t actually need the word atom</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:06.639" style="s2">here we can say string here</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.520" end="01:28:06.639" style="s2">so like that</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:11.280" style="s2">couldn&#39;t match type integer with actual</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.520" end="01:28:15.840" style="s2">type list value yeah we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.280" end="01:28:15.840" style="s2">unpack them</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.480" end="01:28:21.679" style="s2">yeah so the problem with those x&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">their list vowels</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.679" end="01:28:26.239" style="s2">so i mean i could i could like i could</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">write a little helper function called</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.239" end="01:28:29.440" style="s2">like on number</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:31.520" style="s2">which is stupid but goes something like</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.440" end="01:28:33.199" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.520" end="01:28:35.040" style="s2">uh and it is number right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.199" end="01:28:37.360" style="s2">integer</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.040" end="01:28:37.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.360" end="01:28:46.000" style="s2">a number number x equals</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:46.880" style="s2">x and i think if i say like some map on</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.000" end="01:28:50.000" style="s2">number x</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.880" end="01:28:51.440" style="s2">that works construction number should we</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.000" end="01:28:56.480" style="s2">have one argument yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.440" end="01:28:58.800" style="s2">it&#39;s gotta be putting parentheses</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.480" end="01:29:00.719" style="s2">okay cool so that did return four i do</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.800" end="01:29:02.560" style="s2">think there&#39;s a nicer way to write that</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.719" end="01:29:05.360" style="s2">but you know i think we&#39;re pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.560" end="01:29:08.840" style="s2">on the check our understanding okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.360" end="01:29:12.239" style="s2">so we got the type for apply correct</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.840" end="01:29:15.840" style="s2">um apply</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.239" end="01:29:24.320" style="s2">funk args maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.840" end="01:29:28.159" style="s2">bull for false</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.320" end="01:29:28.159" style="s2">oh fancy</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.920" end="01:29:39.840" style="s2">maybe cool force what is a haskell maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.960" end="01:29:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like a type</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.040" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the function maybe if the</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.639" end="01:29:53.120" style="s2">function isn&#39;t found</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.400" end="01:29:56.159" style="s2">we return a bull false but otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.120" end="01:29:56.159" style="s2">this is a look up</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.880" end="01:29:59.199" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.000" end="01:30:03.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where it looks that up</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.880" end="01:30:12.239" style="s2">maybe is applied to too few arguments</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.199" end="01:30:16.560" style="s2">oh this isn&#39;t a comment wow</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.239" end="01:30:19.360" style="s2">wow that was that was look up</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.560" end="01:30:20.800" style="s2">funk primitives oh i thought this was</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.360" end="01:30:24.239" style="s2">like a comment</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.800" end="01:30:26.159" style="s2">i can&#39;t see all right um so now we have</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.239" end="01:30:29.280" style="s2">primitives which is this data type</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.159" end="01:30:31.760" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like a map data type from</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.280" end="01:30:31.760" style="s2">string</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.719" end="01:30:38.960" style="s2">uh it returns something that takes in a</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.679" end="01:30:40.960" style="s2">list and returns a single value</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.960" end="01:30:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty nice and then we can write</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.960" end="01:30:47.040" style="s2">out some of these primitives</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.000" end="01:30:51.040" style="s2">uh here we have plus</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.040" end="01:30:54.000" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s a numeric bin op</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.040" end="01:30:54.000" style="s2">of type plus</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.560" end="01:31:03.840" style="s2">we can copy and paste that not much will</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.360" end="01:31:06.080" style="s2">be gained from typing that</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.840" end="01:31:06.080" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.000" end="01:31:12.560" style="s2">um i think numeric bin op is a function</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.120" end="01:31:14.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to have to write</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.560" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">oh we got to put an equals there oh i</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.560" end="01:31:19.679" style="s2">got to tap that over one</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:24.159" style="s2">cool uh variable not in scope</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.679" end="01:31:31.120" style="s2">okay so numeric been uh look but it</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.159" end="01:31:34.400" style="s2">tells us the type how beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.120" end="01:31:34.400" style="s2">your integer integer</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.280" end="01:31:37.600" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.400" end="01:31:41.199" style="s2">all the integers</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.360" end="01:31:48.320" style="s2">oh okay that&#39;s actually a function here</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:54.560" style="s2">so we&#39;ll just say like f</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.520" end="01:31:56.560" style="s2">args actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.560" end="01:31:58.080" style="s2">we know what the r&#39;s we want to match</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.560" end="01:32:01.360" style="s2">are number</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.080" end="01:32:05.120" style="s2">x comma number y</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.360" end="01:32:05.120" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll return f x y</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.600" end="01:32:09.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.040" end="01:32:14.320" style="s2">uh oh we have to return a number</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.280" end="01:32:16.800" style="s2">numerical</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.320" end="01:32:16.800" style="s2">is that right</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.360" end="01:32:21.040" style="s2">this character oh tab character oh god</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.639" end="01:32:27.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.040" end="01:32:27.840" style="s2">haskell hates tabs as much as i do</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.719" end="01:32:33.360" style="s2">set et</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.840" end="01:32:41.840" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.400" end="01:32:47.120" style="s2">now let&#39;s check how closely i wrote that</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.480" end="01:32:51.520" style="s2">to what they wrote</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.120" end="01:32:54.400" style="s2">seems pretty good um</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.520" end="01:32:56.000" style="s2">oh well okay that&#39;s kind of nicer well</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.400" end="01:32:58.719" style="s2">they actually wrote an unpack</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.000" end="01:33:01.440" style="s2">numb that&#39;s kind of that function i</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.719" end="01:33:08.420" style="s2">wrote before that i threw away remember</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.440" end="01:33:11.579" style="s2">this vowel integer</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.420" end="01:33:11.579" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.480" end="01:33:24.239" style="s2">we&#39;ll just do that for now um so they</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.760" end="01:33:27.600" style="s2">called it</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.239" end="01:33:29.440" style="s2">op and they&#39;re using fold l the problem</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.600" end="01:33:30.400" style="s2">with my implementation here is it only</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.440" end="01:33:33.360" style="s2">supports two</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.400" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">arguments uh my other one didn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.360" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">i did</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:41.679" style="s2">some but uh fold l1</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:44.719" style="s2">op map unpack num on params</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.679" end="01:33:46.480" style="s2">cool now two plus two</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.719" end="01:33:47.840" style="s2">that still works we can also add a three</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.480" end="01:33:49.440" style="s2">in there then we get seven oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.840" end="01:34:04.320" style="s2">nice sexy bros</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.440" end="01:34:06.639" style="s2">all right um</p>

<p begin="01:34:06.639" end="01:34:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t like this week typing</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.880" end="01:34:16.320" style="s2">no weak typing</p>

<p begin="01:34:26.320" end="01:34:34.320" style="s2">um so let&#39;s see if this works</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.560" end="01:34:37.760" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna nest and see if we get a</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.320" end="01:34:46.400" style="s2">five oh yeah five</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.760" end="01:34:48.400" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s see if this works</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.400" end="01:34:49.840" style="s2">change unpack num so that always returns</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.400" end="01:34:50.800" style="s2">zero well that&#39;s what i want to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.840" end="01:34:53.440" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.800" end="01:34:55.920" style="s2">that&#39;s right everything else be a number</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.440" end="01:34:55.920" style="s2">or be</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.840" end="01:35:01.840" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.199" end="01:35:16.880" style="s2">add the symbol handling functions</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.199" end="01:35:28.800" style="s2">add primitives all right which one</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.880" end="01:35:32.320" style="s2">should we do</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.800" end="01:35:34.639" style="s2">what&#39;s your keyboard wow</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.320" end="01:35:36.639" style="s2">do you listen bro you get a timeout</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.639" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">maybe you just you know don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.639" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">you guys want three</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.440" end="01:35:47.760" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.040" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.400" end="01:35:58.800" style="s2">yo what&#39;s the mouse boss california all</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.000" end="01:35:58.800" style="s2">right all right</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.360" end="01:36:06.560" style="s2">uh why do you think we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.560" end="01:36:08.880" style="s2">the singularity</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.560" end="01:36:10.000" style="s2">i think zero for everything else is</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.880" end="01:36:11.679" style="s2">related to nil</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.000" end="01:36:13.679" style="s2">punting i don&#39;t know what mill punting</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.679" end="01:36:15.600" style="s2">is i just didn&#39;t want to write that</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.679" end="01:36:17.119" style="s2">other code</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.600" end="01:36:26.159" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s ugly and i think</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.119" end="01:36:26.159" style="s2">that you know get your types right um</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.040" end="01:36:32.080" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know about this okay uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:39.040" style="s2">what do we want to write</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.080" end="01:36:40.560" style="s2">we like one or we like three</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.040" end="01:36:43.040" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s write let&#39;s write one let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.560" end="01:36:45.440" style="s2">do one one looks pretty easy</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.040" end="01:36:46.960" style="s2">hey guys you all want three all right</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.440" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">can someone explain to me what three</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.960" end="01:36:57.040" style="s2">is add symbol handling functions</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.840" end="01:37:00.480" style="s2">returns true if</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.040" end="01:37:00.480" style="s2">obj is a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.280" end="01:37:08.320" style="s2">are they like atoms</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.960" end="01:37:13.119" style="s2">symbol is what we&#39;ve been calling an</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.719" end="01:37:13.119" style="s2">atom</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.520" end="01:37:25.119" style="s2">okay okay we can give this a try</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.520" end="01:37:28.480" style="s2">let&#39;s see what we got symbol</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.119" end="01:37:28.480" style="s2">question mark foo</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.320" end="01:37:37.600" style="s2">false but foo is supposed to be a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.360" end="01:37:39.199" style="s2">what is just foo it&#39;s an atom foo but i</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.600" end="01:37:41.440" style="s2">don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.199" end="01:37:41.440" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.440" end="01:37:45.920" style="s2">so like</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.119" end="01:37:50.560" style="s2">but that&#39;s an atom plus</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.239" end="01:38:04.800" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.360" end="01:38:10.560" style="s2">whoa wait this is a lot of functions you</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.520" end="01:38:10.560" style="s2">guys want me to write</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.960" end="01:38:15.600" style="s2">i like eq that one seems like something</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.119" end="01:38:18.639" style="s2">we can implement i like eq</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.600" end="01:38:18.639" style="s2">that should return true</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.719" end="01:38:22.320" style="s2">how does it know to return false</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.400" end="01:38:27.760" style="s2">where is that false oh that&#39;s just in</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.360" end="01:38:31.199" style="s2">the maybe okay cool</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.760" end="01:38:34.159" style="s2">um so we&#39;ll add some primitive function</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.199" end="01:38:34.159" style="s2">uh eq</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.719" end="01:38:45.840" style="s2">we can call it</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.639" end="01:38:55.199" style="s2">um compare</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.280" end="01:38:59.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a bin op i thought a bin op only</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.199" end="01:38:59.840" style="s2">took in two things</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.320" end="01:39:07.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know compare been up</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.840" end="01:39:14.639" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t actually need to write the</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.719" end="01:39:17.600" style="s2">type for this one</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.639" end="01:39:18.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say that it&#39;s only if we have atom</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.600" end="01:39:21.199" style="s2">x</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.080" end="01:39:25.840" style="s2">atom y in the list</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.199" end="01:39:28.960" style="s2">uh otherwise it returns</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.840" end="01:39:40.800" style="s2">false equals</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.960" end="01:39:44.560" style="s2">bool x equals equals y</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.800" end="01:39:47.760" style="s2">variable not in scope oh</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.560" end="01:39:48.159" style="s2">let me just compare it up oh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.760" end="01:39:54.239" style="s2">have an</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.159" end="01:39:56.400" style="s2">op i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.239" end="01:39:59.760" style="s2">i mean that works right non-exhaustive</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.400" end="01:40:02.000" style="s2">pattern and function eval</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.760" end="01:40:04.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll get it though this should be a</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.000" end="01:40:04.320" style="s2">funk</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.440" end="01:40:12.719" style="s2">lookup funk primitive eval which</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.520" end="01:40:14.800" style="s2">this should be an atom i believe we</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.719" end="01:40:17.199" style="s2">can&#39;t eval an atom but that&#39;s an atom</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.800" end="01:40:17.199" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.840" end="01:40:23.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.600" end="01:40:29.040" style="s2">be bites back thank you for gifting subs</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.159" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">to people</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.040" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">i appreciate you you are a good person</p>

<p begin="01:40:41.920" end="01:40:45.920" style="s2">gifted</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.800" end="01:40:45.920" style="s2">everybody a sub</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.480" end="01:40:51.440" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.520" end="01:40:55.119" style="s2">uh bee bites back if you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.440" end="01:40:55.119" style="s2">i will take your questions seriously</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.080" end="01:41:04.239" style="s2">you get a real answer won&#39;t even try to</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.840" end="01:41:06.880" style="s2">troll</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.239" end="01:41:09.760" style="s2">what do you think of pvm well i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.880" end="01:41:09.760" style="s2">know what pvm is</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.080" end="01:41:13.360" style="s2">oh virtual machine</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.840" end="01:41:21.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.960" end="01:41:23.360" style="s2">is a tool for parallel networking of</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.520" end="01:41:26.480" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.360" end="01:41:29.119" style="s2">it is designed to allow a network of</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.480" end="01:41:31.119" style="s2">heterogeneous unix computers</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.119" end="01:41:32.239" style="s2">to use the single distributed parallel</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.119" end="01:41:35.520" style="s2">processor</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.239" end="01:41:38.719" style="s2">so my immediate</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.520" end="01:41:41.840" style="s2">thought about this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.719" end="01:41:44.400" style="s2">what you the main problem you have here</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.840" end="01:41:45.440" style="s2">um so even even within a dual xeon</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.400" end="01:41:47.760" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.440" end="01:41:50.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a pneuma architecture it has</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.760" end="01:41:53.440" style="s2">non-uniform memory access right</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.159" end="01:41:56.719" style="s2">so the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.440" end="01:41:58.480" style="s2">with doing this is you have different</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.719" end="01:42:00.239" style="s2">bandwidth links to different parts of</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.480" end="01:42:03.280" style="s2">your memory see i want</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.239" end="01:42:06.159" style="s2">multiple processors to act on the same</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.280" end="01:42:07.440" style="s2">bit of data the question is where do i</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.159" end="01:42:09.040" style="s2">store the data</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.440" end="01:42:11.119" style="s2">well so i have a few options i can store</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.040" end="01:42:12.719" style="s2">the data on one machine probably local</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.119" end="01:42:14.159" style="s2">to let&#39;s say one of the processors</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.719" end="01:42:15.840" style="s2">but then every time the other machine</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.159" end="01:42:17.280" style="s2">wants to access that data</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.840" end="01:42:19.199" style="s2">it has to go across the network and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.280" end="01:42:21.520" style="s2">network is much slower than the bus</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.199" end="01:42:22.800" style="s2">that links the processor to the memory</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.520" end="01:42:26.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.800" end="01:42:28.080" style="s2">so you can another way to deal with this</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.560" end="01:42:30.400" style="s2">is to have two copies of the data</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.080" end="01:42:31.840" style="s2">in the memory of both machines uh but</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.400" end="01:42:33.280" style="s2">then you need some way to synchronize</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.840" end="01:42:35.600" style="s2">them you&#39;re gonna need some kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.280" end="01:42:36.719" style="s2">uh caching mechanism uh what do they say</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.600" end="01:42:37.840" style="s2">there&#39;s two hard problems in computer</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.719" end="01:42:39.119" style="s2">science and one of them is cash</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.840" end="01:42:42.320" style="s2">invalidation</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.119" end="01:42:44.719" style="s2">so that&#39;s my like analysis</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.320" end="01:42:46.320" style="s2">right away of something like this like</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.719" end="01:42:50.000" style="s2">it can&#39;t exactly be</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.320" end="01:42:52.239" style="s2">automated um pvm consists of a</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.000" end="01:42:55.280" style="s2">runtime environment library for message</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.239" end="01:42:57.760" style="s2">passing task and resource management</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.280" end="01:43:00.239" style="s2">so yeah i mean as a anything that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.760" end="01:43:03.679" style="s2">library libraries are always nice</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.239" end="01:43:08.080" style="s2">um but i think there&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.679" end="01:43:10.560" style="s2">mpi yeah and i&#39;ve seen or like m-p-i-c-h</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.080" end="01:43:12.719" style="s2">you know build your beowulf cluster</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.560" end="01:43:14.639" style="s2">uh but yeah so i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.719" end="01:43:16.480" style="s2">advantages would be over</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.639" end="01:43:18.239" style="s2">uh something more modern that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.480" end="01:43:19.040" style="s2">does this but there&#39;s no way to do this</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.239" end="01:43:21.440" style="s2">for free</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.040" end="01:43:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s always going to be somewhat tricky</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.440" end="01:43:27.199" style="s2">to uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.960" end="01:43:27.199" style="s2">use um</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.920" end="01:43:34.960" style="s2">you mean a different pvm well okay now</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.800" end="01:43:39.360" style="s2">let&#39;s look at this pvm</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.960" end="01:43:41.760" style="s2">predictive vision in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.360" end="01:43:43.440" style="s2">but see when i give a real analysis on</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.760" end="01:43:45.760" style="s2">something without troll look it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.440" end="01:43:45.760" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.360" end="01:44:07.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s um starcodex has to say</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.159" end="01:44:11.840" style="s2">there an archive post or something</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.320" end="01:44:18.639" style="s2">unsupervised learning from continuous</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.320" end="01:44:20.080" style="s2">video um so my immediate thought is okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.639" end="01:44:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s gbt3 for video</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.080" end="01:44:26.000" style="s2">and of course gpt3 for video works</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.760" end="01:44:26.000" style="s2">really well now actually build it</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.480" end="01:44:35.840" style="s2">let&#39;s see what actual results they got</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.400" end="01:44:42.400" style="s2">so one of the problems in general with</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.880" end="01:44:44.560" style="s2">video prediction</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.400" end="01:44:46.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure they deal with it in</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.560" end="01:44:49.040" style="s2">any kind of good way</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.000" end="01:44:52.080" style="s2">is what&#39;s your output space</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.040" end="01:44:54.000" style="s2">uh so if you&#39;re if your output space is</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.080" end="01:44:55.520" style="s2">images what&#39;s your loss function on</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.000" end="01:44:57.600" style="s2">images</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.520" end="01:45:00.239" style="s2">something like msc or mae probably</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.600" end="01:45:02.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t capture what you want</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.239" end="01:45:05.040" style="s2">you can use sophisticated things that</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.400" end="01:45:07.679" style="s2">try to capture structure like ssim</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.040" end="01:45:09.520" style="s2">or you can use gan style loss functions</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.679" end="01:45:15.280" style="s2">which are unstable</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.520" end="01:45:18.560" style="s2">um so that&#39;s my first thought to this</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.280" end="01:45:20.400" style="s2">uh and then another great way to</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.560" end="01:45:21.600" style="s2">immediately evaluate any machine</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.400" end="01:45:24.320" style="s2">learning paper</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.600" end="01:45:24.719" style="s2">is look for the actual benchmark that</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.320" end="01:45:29.280" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.719" end="01:45:34.719" style="s2">are um that they are state of the art on</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.280" end="01:45:34.719" style="s2">so they&#39;re going for tracker benchmarks</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.800" end="01:45:45.840" style="s2">okay compared it with these things</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.679" end="01:46:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m going to archive for that i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.440" end="01:46:27.840" style="s2">github is still up</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.280" end="01:46:27.840" style="s2">there&#39;s brain corps</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.840" end="01:46:55.840" style="s2">how did they get outputs from this thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.199" end="01:46:55.840" style="s2">so what&#39;s their actual loss function</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.840" end="01:47:25.679" style="s2">primary signal predictive so</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.239" end="01:47:39.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why you need all of this</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.840" end="01:47:39.840" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.960" end="01:47:53.040" style="s2">um what&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.400" end="01:47:53.040" style="s2">real loss function</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.920" end="01:48:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um so</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.639" end="01:48:06.239" style="s2">i i could spend if i really wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.880" end="01:48:07.840" style="s2">dive into this paper it would take an</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.239" end="01:48:11.920" style="s2">entire stream</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.840" end="01:48:14.800" style="s2">um all video prediction things</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.920" end="01:48:15.440" style="s2">you you have to ask a few questions uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.800" end="01:48:18.159" style="s2">one is</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.440" end="01:48:18.960" style="s2">is the is the prediction that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.159" end="01:48:22.639" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.960" end="01:48:24.800" style="s2">context specific or context free um</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.639" end="01:48:26.000" style="s2">at comma when we build models which</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.800" end="01:48:28.880" style="s2">effectively compress</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.000" end="01:48:30.080" style="s2">driving video we ignore things like the</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.880" end="01:48:32.719" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.080" end="01:48:34.719" style="s2">um and we do this in an unsupervised way</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.719" end="01:48:36.400" style="s2">because the trees are irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.719" end="01:48:38.560" style="s2">the exact shape of the trees are</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.400" end="01:48:40.159" style="s2">irrelevant to how to drive the car</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.560" end="01:48:42.000" style="s2">uh so if you&#39;re building things that</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.159" end="01:48:43.920" style="s2">just predict video</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.000" end="01:48:47.600" style="s2">humans don&#39;t really do this humans</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.920" end="01:48:50.639" style="s2">always have our specific context in mind</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.600" end="01:48:54.320" style="s2">um so i&#39;m not sure like if</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.639" end="01:48:56.239" style="s2">they do that here uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.320" end="01:48:57.920" style="s2">and then the other question is are you</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.239" end="01:48:58.960" style="s2">reasoning are you trying to predict an</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.920" end="01:49:01.040" style="s2">image space</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.960" end="01:49:02.400" style="s2">or are you trying to predict in some</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.040" end="01:49:04.880" style="s2">vision feature space</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.400" end="01:49:06.880" style="s2">i think that predicting an image space</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.880" end="01:49:09.360" style="s2">is the wrong idea</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.880" end="01:49:11.600" style="s2">uh because i don&#39;t think they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.360" end="01:49:14.719" style="s2">image space</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.600" end="01:49:18.560" style="s2">i think it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.719" end="01:49:22.480" style="s2">uh but if you ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.560" end="01:49:24.639" style="s2">can you build gpt3 for video it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.480" end="01:49:25.840" style="s2">classic link you think oh gbt3 you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.639" end="01:49:27.440" style="s2">what if i just took all the youtube</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.840" end="01:49:28.320" style="s2">videos and put them into one huge auto</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.440" end="01:49:31.040" style="s2">encoder</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.320" end="01:49:33.760" style="s2">um well so unfortunately you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.040" end="01:49:37.599" style="s2">the beauty of gpt 3&#39;s loss function</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.760" end="01:49:40.880" style="s2">uh gpt3 is just this loss function</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.599" end="01:49:43.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s categorical cross-entropy</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.880" end="01:49:45.280" style="s2">category cross entropy is is a</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.280" end="01:49:47.360" style="s2">beautifully simple loss function</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.280" end="01:49:49.280" style="s2">that can be used because there are not</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.360" end="01:49:50.400" style="s2">that many tokens in your language space</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.280" end="01:49:52.719" style="s2">even if you have like</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.400" end="01:49:54.800" style="s2">uh you know 8 000 right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.719" end="01:49:58.800" style="s2">only 8 000 dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.800" end="01:50:01.840" style="s2">of output versus for video</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.800" end="01:50:04.400" style="s2">well it&#39;s not even it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.840" end="01:50:05.599" style="s2">not even the number of pixels because</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.400" end="01:50:09.199" style="s2">what you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.599" end="01:50:11.199" style="s2">capturing there is joint representations</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.199" end="01:50:13.599" style="s2">even if you had an output for each pixel</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.199" end="01:50:16.320" style="s2">which is way more than 8 000 dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.599" end="01:50:18.159" style="s2">what about in pac-man where a ghost</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.320" end="01:50:19.520" style="s2">could go to the left or a ghost could go</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.159" end="01:50:22.400" style="s2">to the right</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.520" end="01:50:24.239" style="s2">right that&#39;s the you have to capture</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.400" end="01:50:27.920" style="s2">that joint distribution</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.239" end="01:50:27.920" style="s2">not blur the ghost both ways</p>

<p begin="02:25:49.920" end="02:25:53.200" style="s2">acceptable to discriminate on</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.520" end="02:25:54.800" style="s2">you can discriminate based on skill and</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.200" end="02:25:59.200" style="s2">you can discriminate based on</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.800" end="02:26:00.960" style="s2">paying money um if you think about how</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.200" end="02:26:03.520" style="s2">like job interviews discriminate based</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.960" end="02:26:05.520" style="s2">on skill college allegedly does</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.520" end="02:26:06.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s you know actually based on</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.520" end="02:26:10.080" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.640" end="02:26:11.439" style="s2">uh racism or nepotism um</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.080" end="02:26:12.720" style="s2">but you know theoretically it should</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.439" end="02:26:15.040" style="s2">just discriminate based on skill if you</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.720" end="02:26:17.040" style="s2">think about a bar with a cover charge</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.040" end="02:26:18.560" style="s2">uh bar the cover charge is</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.040" end="02:26:22.000" style="s2">discriminating based on</p>
<p begin="02:26:18.560" end="02:26:24.319" style="s2">money so i think you do want both</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.000" end="02:26:26.479" style="s2">we want both smart people and uh people</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.319" end="02:26:27.920" style="s2">who are willing to contribute resources</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.479" end="02:26:29.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not a question of their actual</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.920" end="02:26:30.080" style="s2">wealth it&#39;s a question of whether</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.359" end="02:26:32.960" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.080" end="02:26:34.000" style="s2">willing to to contribute uh they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.960" end="02:26:35.359" style="s2">look you know i understand</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.000" end="02:26:36.640" style="s2">that i might not be as good as the other</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.359" end="02:26:37.359" style="s2">people here but i&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.640" end="02:26:39.600" style="s2">contribute</p>

<p begin="02:26:42.479" end="02:26:45.359" style="s2">because what you&#39;re basically saying is</p>

<p begin="02:26:57.840" end="02:27:01.120" style="s2">the test did i do something wrong i</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.200" end="02:27:05.120" style="s2">might have done something wrong</p>

<p begin="02:28:17.680" end="02:28:21.280" style="s2">a question like what programming</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.040" end="02:28:24.399" style="s2">language did you learn first i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.280" end="02:28:26.080" style="s2">like that&#39;s not a good question um and</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.399" end="02:28:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good question because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.080" end="02:28:30.479" style="s2">question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.200" end="02:28:31.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s totally meaningless i think i</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.479" end="02:28:34.160" style="s2">said a few times how</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.600" end="02:28:35.120" style="s2">i try not to talk about myself on these</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.160" end="02:28:37.680" style="s2">streams because</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.120" end="02:28:39.520" style="s2">my idiosyncratic life path doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.680" end="02:28:40.880" style="s2">anything to do with</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.520" end="02:28:42.880" style="s2">skill it doesn&#39;t have anything to do</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.880" end="02:28:44.720" style="s2">with anything that&#39;s real it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.880" end="02:28:46.880" style="s2">thing with keyboards and terminals</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.720" end="02:28:46.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:28:48.880" end="02:28:53.280" style="s2">um so what are examples of good</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.560" end="02:28:57.200" style="s2">questions a good questions are questions</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.280" end="02:28:57.200" style="s2">that lead to the discovery of truth</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.880" end="02:29:02.479" style="s2">um like when we looked at that when we</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.040" end="02:29:05.920" style="s2">looked at that paper earlier the</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.479" end="02:29:06.399" style="s2">the the video predictive one yeah what</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.920" end="02:29:09.520" style="s2">are your</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.399" end="02:29:11.040" style="s2">well yeah what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.520" end="02:29:13.280" style="s2">i mean honestly even what are your</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.040" end="02:29:16.080" style="s2">thoughts on can be higher tier</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.280" end="02:29:17.600" style="s2">than uh what programming language did</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.080" end="02:29:21.040" style="s2">you learn first</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.600" end="02:29:24.399" style="s2">um what is truth so truth is something</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.040" end="02:29:25.840" style="s2">that if two people uh were to sit on</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.399" end="02:29:28.960" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.840" end="02:29:30.800" style="s2">uh and research something they would</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.960" end="02:29:32.399" style="s2">come to the same conclusion</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.800" end="02:29:34.399" style="s2">well let&#39;s say n people it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.399" end="02:29:35.720" style="s2">to be two right it&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.399" end="02:29:40.240" style="s2">objectively</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.720" end="02:29:40.240" style="s2">discoverable through the universe</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.040" end="02:29:51.840" style="s2">uh no i mean let&#39;s ask the internet</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.800" end="02:29:51.840" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of my definition but</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.640" end="02:30:04.319" style="s2">uh so another definition that i have for</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.520" end="02:30:08.560" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.319" end="02:30:08.560" style="s2">is anything that has predictive power</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.680" end="02:30:19.840" style="s2">no truth isn&#39;t subjective opinions are</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.840" end="02:30:19.840" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.880" end="02:30:32.880" style="s2">uh you pointed out that cs education is</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.040" end="02:30:34.880" style="s2">bad i haven&#39;t done that into tetris</p>
<p begin="02:30:32.880" end="02:30:36.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a similar sort of idea and</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.880" end="02:30:39.359" style="s2">it might be a good test it might be a</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.160" end="02:30:39.359" style="s2">good it might be a good course</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.520" end="02:30:50.640" style="s2">yeah truth&#39;s not subjective this is</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.880" end="02:30:52.240" style="s2">people who want to sell you hogwash you</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.640" end="02:30:53.439" style="s2">know if you want to sell snake oil</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.240" end="02:30:56.960" style="s2">instead of medicine</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.439" end="02:30:56.960" style="s2">start out by telling people truth is</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.840" end="02:31:01.840" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.800" end="02:31:10.240" style="s2">truth conforms to reality but maybe and</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.560" end="02:31:11.840" style="s2">then you can maybe put a kind of value</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.240" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">hierarchy on truth and</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.840" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">the truths that allow you to predict</p>
<p begin="02:31:16.160" end="02:31:24.160" style="s2">um the future are valuable</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.640" end="02:31:24.160" style="s2">this is you say this is straight from</p>
<p begin="02:31:24.479" end="02:31:43.840" style="s2">oh substantive revision</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.240" end="02:31:43.840" style="s2">see i&#39;m concerned about that revision</p>

<p begin="02:31:58.160" end="02:32:01.840" style="s2">so science allows you to compress the</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.240" end="02:32:04.880" style="s2">past and if you can compress the past</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.840" end="02:32:04.880" style="s2">you can predict the future</p>

<p begin="02:33:07.920" end="02:33:12.880" style="s2">i saw something</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.280" end="02:33:14.399" style="s2">one of the comments in the last video</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.880" end="02:33:16.399" style="s2">was like</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.399" end="02:33:18.800" style="s2">george is becoming more of a cult leader</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.399" end="02:33:22.240" style="s2">every day</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.800" end="02:33:23.760" style="s2">my only thought on that is well what if</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.240" end="02:33:25.040" style="s2">we live in a world that no longer</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.760" end="02:33:26.800" style="s2">believes in truth</p>
<p begin="02:33:25.040" end="02:33:29.120" style="s2">but there&#39;s a cult that does believe in</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.800" end="02:33:32.960" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="02:33:29.120" end="02:33:35.840" style="s2">you know who&#39;s the cult</p>
<p begin="02:33:32.960" end="02:33:38.399" style="s2">usually usually cults are are uh</p>
<p begin="02:33:35.840" end="02:33:40.479" style="s2">demarcated by people believing dumb</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.399" end="02:33:43.359" style="s2">like comet hail bop is going to beam us</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.479" end="02:33:47.040" style="s2">all up to the starship enterprise</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.359" end="02:33:47.439" style="s2">um you know and now people believe dumb</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.040" end="02:33:51.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:33:47.439" end="02:33:51.920" style="s2">like uh well you know uh</p>
<p begin="02:33:54.560" end="02:34:03.520" style="s2">biological sex is a social construct or</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.280" end="02:34:07.120" style="s2">something like that right</p>
<p begin="02:34:03.520" end="02:34:07.120" style="s2">i mean yeah the cult&#39;s called science</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.840" end="02:34:17.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.080" end="02:34:28.319" style="s2">well this is what the university was</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.520" end="02:34:31.359" style="s2">supposed to be i i</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.319" end="02:34:34.080" style="s2">i think uh no i know what happened to</p>
<p begin="02:34:31.359" end="02:34:36.319" style="s2">the anabaptists and jan von leiden and</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.080" end="02:34:38.640" style="s2"> man it didn&#39;t end well for them</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.319" end="02:34:38.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.840" end="02:34:45.040" style="s2">well i mean it doesn&#39;t matter whether</p>
