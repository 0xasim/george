<p begin="00:06:55.610" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">let&#39;s just pass verbose into that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:25.340" style="s2">were actually doing here 45 edges okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:29.570" style="s2">that&#39;s nice you&#39;re not bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.340" end="00:07:29.570" style="s2">never mind already doing this</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.940" end="00:07:39.850" style="s2">okay well it&#39;s really not optimizing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.130" end="00:07:42.900" style="s2">much ever I&#39;m just kind of shady I look</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.850" end="00:07:47.100" style="s2">at the chives it stays the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.900" end="00:07:47.100" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.890" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">winding wall frames even if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.180" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">local tribes oh yes I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.300" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">well we can certainly change that so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.740" end="00:08:21.150" style="s2">we fix points their local frames if fix</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:21.150" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.970" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">how did that break who&#39;s got unlocked</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.190" end="00:09:05.710" style="s2">still not optimizing for show local</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">fairs are fixed point out self-taught</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.710" end="00:09:14.620" style="s2">frames and we should suck some weed</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">today I think we should from I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.620" end="00:09:19.630" style="s2">really feeling this Red Bull I kind of</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.340" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">think we were thoughtful weed today I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.630" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">think so I think Sunday that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:37.290" style="s2">do let&#39;s get blazed brah</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:39.580" style="s2">but let&#39;s figure out where we are first</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.290" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">okay so I don&#39;t know why this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.580" end="00:09:49.810" style="s2">optimize it all some of those edges just</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:51.520" style="s2">total garbage we can&#39;t optimize them six</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.810" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">points I&#39;ll sell my frames like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.520" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">right we don&#39;t really need this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.270" end="00:10:52.930" style="s2">well it&#39;s not really optimizing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:52.930" style="s2">those are pretty high errors actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:29.209" style="s2">okay also why is this that and this that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.580" end="00:11:36.730" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make sense crazy is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.209" end="00:11:36.730" style="s2">working I mess something up</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.510" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">the FFF is not not an estimated playback</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.090" end="00:12:03.460" style="s2">it goes crazy now okay let&#39;s figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:12:03.460" style="s2">what I got stop well</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.420" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">hmm now I&#39;m fixing the positions of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.250" end="00:12:24.440" style="s2">points so that should be okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:24.440" style="s2">what let&#39;s just refactor this to do this</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.590" end="00:41:31.250" style="s2">velocity model</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:54.049" style="s2">okay I mean this says something about</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.019" end="00:41:55.099" style="s2">like whether the ShipWorks are hot which</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.049" end="00:41:58.660" style="s2">is like not really</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.099" end="00:41:58.660" style="s2">let&#39;s make telecommute that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.090" end="00:42:10.790" style="s2">look at that like kind of fixes them</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:17.660" style="s2">first off how amazing is that speed</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.940" end="00:42:41.749" style="s2">let me optimize a little bit beause it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.650" end="00:42:44.949" style="s2">was true such thing would benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.749" end="00:42:44.949" style="s2">more iterations</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.980" end="00:43:06.510" style="s2">so you can literally put anything in for</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.770" end="00:43:07.770" style="s2">the initial estimate of clothes you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.510" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">put in total garbage</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.770" end="00:43:29.960" style="s2">and it gives you something except that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:33.230" style="s2">one the one over there all right no hos</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.960" end="00:43:33.230" style="s2">optimization back</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.650" end="00:43:47.559" style="s2">it&#39;s even higher quality sometimes does</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.219" end="00:43:47.559" style="s2">that romance</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.890" end="00:43:55.859" style="s2">it looks good once we put in pose</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.930" end="00:43:55.859" style="s2">optimization</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">it is concerning to me that that just</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.120" end="00:44:31.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work let&#39;s just do this the hell</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:31.490" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.330" end="00:44:53.030" style="s2">it&#39;s the Samsun distance here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.740" end="00:44:53.030" style="s2">the actual interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.260" end="00:45:18.350" style="s2">this thing I wanted to do this Center in</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.090" end="00:45:18.350" style="s2">normalize point residuals</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.400" end="00:45:35.020" style="s2">it calls the same set up and straight</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.289" end="00:45:37.240" style="s2">matrix I don&#39;t actually give a I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.020" end="00:45:47.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want someone here to talk to so</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.240" end="00:45:48.609" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking to myself well okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.140" end="00:45:52.809" style="s2">amazing that fundamental matrices don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.609" end="00:45:56.020" style="s2">seem to work at all really now but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.809" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">swear it used to I swear it used to what</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.020" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.069" end="00:46:31.930" style="s2">I swear this used to work</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.630" end="00:46:48.700" style="s2">moving that way is that what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:52.630" style="s2">like why is the fundamental matrix doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.700" end="00:46:55.600" style="s2">this and so that&#39;s with only fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.630" end="00:46:57.910" style="s2">matrices may be used to only work on</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.600" end="00:47:02.590" style="s2">like Ohio and this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.910" end="00:47:20.890" style="s2">initially had no it doesn&#39;t work on Ohio</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.590" end="00:47:39.240" style="s2">I find alright let&#39;s just implement this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.890" end="00:47:39.240" style="s2">class let&#39;s try with our own variant</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.680" end="00:47:53.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why that was stupid mags</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.400" end="00:49:10.759" style="s2">setup constraint very tricks sad ass</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.050" end="00:49:43.000" style="s2">why don&#39;t you do that oh so that gets</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.220" end="00:49:44.560" style="s2">the matrix so there&#39;s actually a second</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.000" end="00:49:49.320" style="s2">constraint I can force because this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.560" end="00:49:49.320" style="s2">an essential matrix basically this</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.060" end="00:50:03.150" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.410" end="00:50:39.080" style="s2">and now we also need the residual</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:39.080" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.970" end="00:51:16.380" style="s2">that&#39;s matrix is not the fight</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.100" end="00:51:23.100" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.550" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">thank you a normalised point does this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.910" end="00:51:48.020" style="s2">do okay so I don&#39;t make sure it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:48.020" style="s2">just say like best no I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.980" end="00:52:19.350" style="s2">no nice points oh just don&#39;t even need</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.150" end="00:52:20.820" style="s2">that that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.350" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">like at least now it&#39;s ping pong in</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.820" end="00:52:29.310" style="s2">between two reasonable solutions you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:31.500" style="s2">well that&#39;s actually pretty good now so</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.310" end="00:52:35.910" style="s2">okay this problem that this is a known</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.500" end="00:52:43.470" style="s2">problem we don&#39;t know which is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.910" end="00:52:45.390" style="s2">correct yeah okay you can&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.470" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">you&#39;re going like this or like this from</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.390" end="00:52:52.440" style="s2">the fundamental matrix but that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:52:54.150" style="s2">better at least yeah I kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.440" end="00:52:56.510" style="s2">they&#39;re like subtractor thing doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.150" end="00:52:56.510" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.839" end="00:53:18.609" style="s2">let&#39;s make the assumption that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.009" end="00:53:18.609" style="s2">always moving</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.530" end="00:54:04.820" style="s2">well the norm is always one but what do</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.900" end="00:54:17.150" style="s2">we really want now yeah sounds pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.820" end="00:54:29.330" style="s2">good well how about you know what okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.150" end="00:54:30.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s all about this way yeah cool so</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.330" end="00:54:32.359" style="s2">it&#39;s doing that only with fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.680" end="00:54:34.130" style="s2">matrices now that looks much better</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.359" end="00:54:36.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the bug was with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.130" end="00:54:36.490" style="s2">other one</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.250" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s without an optimizer</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.480" end="00:54:53.740" style="s2">oh that&#39;s pretty good however why is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:55.330" style="s2">filtering a lot that&#39;s good they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.740" end="00:55:01.900" style="s2">doing a thousand trial also there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.330" end="00:55:10.660" style="s2">lots just as good with a hundred looks a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.900" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">lot faster algorithm it&#39;s not bad now we</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.660" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">have a working essential matrix again oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.660" end="00:55:21.310" style="s2">we actually don&#39;t know if that&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.930" style="s2">let&#39;s try it on the irritation one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.310" end="00:55:28.690" style="s2">see if my rotations are reversed because</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.930" end="00:55:31.020" style="s2">that might actually be universe knows</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.690" end="00:55:31.020" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:45.890" style="s2">yeah so you see what it&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.120" end="00:55:49.730" style="s2">essential matrix always has to have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.890" end="00:55:51.560" style="s2">magnitude of translation of 100 so</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.730" end="00:56:08.320" style="s2">technically this should be like an se</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.560" end="00:56:08.320" style="s2">something qua interesting okay well</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.150" end="00:57:03.460" style="s2">those tabs little taps no that was close</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.740" end="00:57:03.460" style="s2">I want to miss all the optimization</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.940" end="00:57:24.849" style="s2">know why it goes crazy like that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.250" end="00:57:24.849" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.210" end="00:57:41.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why I want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.890" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">hashman issues it&#39;s still rotating</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.450" end="00:57:51.329" style="s2">stupid velocity model yeah we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">here to talk about some very cars like</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.329" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">what why why do you think we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.760" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting about a test is fail</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.130" end="00:58:06.390" style="s2">sorry I said I&#39;d be profiling today we</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:14.579" style="s2">haven&#39;t done any profile you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.390" end="00:58:16.349" style="s2">done improved please no yes cool alright</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.579" end="00:58:20.690" style="s2">that&#39;s back to looking pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.349" end="00:58:20.690" style="s2">little bumps there like that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.420" end="00:58:37.829" style="s2">let&#39;s just say a custom I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.250" end="00:58:40.130" style="s2">call it my own right I did copy it psych</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.829" end="00:58:40.130" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:18.190" style="s2">five hundred million dollars guys what</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:18.820" style="s2">the hell I do with five hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.190" end="00:59:21.190" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.820" end="00:59:22.930" style="s2">can&#39;t deploy capital like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.190" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">the real scam of those icos you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.930" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t realize like capital is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:29.800" style="s2">always a food could be a burden right</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:31.360" style="s2">how are you gonna wait 1 million how how</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.800" end="00:59:34.540" style="s2">are you going to deploy 4 billion</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.360" end="00:59:37.120" style="s2">dollars to improve euros you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.540" end="00:59:39.370" style="s2">can&#39;t even scam with that should we do</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.120" end="00:59:39.970" style="s2">live streaming crypto scams one of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.370" end="00:59:42.910" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.970" end="00:59:49.840" style="s2">sometime I scam crypto there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.910" end="00:59:55.240" style="s2">great scams and crypto blockchain block</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.840" end="00:59:57.010" style="s2">chains okay well so turn off this</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.240" end="00:59:58.750" style="s2">optimize are so powerful that even no</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.010" end="01:00:01.900" style="s2">matter how crappy the rest of my slam is</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.750" end="01:00:03.820" style="s2">it kind of works so I mean that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.900" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">of good but kind of bad because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.820" end="01:00:22.200" style="s2">masking other bugs okay so first off</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.530" end="01:00:26.130" style="s2">let&#39;s get you rid of my kinematic model</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.200" end="01:00:26.130" style="s2">because that&#39;s breaking things</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.670" end="01:00:46.890" style="s2">like this was breaking our pie but okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.660" end="01:00:48.930" style="s2">so you see like when the essential</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.890" end="01:00:52.589" style="s2">matrix runs like it goes like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.930" end="01:00:53.940" style="s2">I might pose optimizing okay why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.589" end="01:00:56.809" style="s2">the pose optimizer fixing that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.940" end="01:00:56.809" style="s2">what I understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.420" end="01:01:21.199" style="s2">kolmad is almost pure rotation so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.459" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">not really sure what they expect but</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.199" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">also like it shouldn&#39;t be doing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.040" end="01:01:32.040" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.530" end="01:01:52.590" style="s2">okay so first of all these points are</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.300" end="01:01:55.460" style="s2">total garbage because it&#39;s pure</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.590" end="01:01:55.460" style="s2">translation</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.470" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">I hate that the optimizer does that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.740" end="01:02:08.599" style="s2">my local frame window that&#39;s smaller</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:08.599" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.830" end="01:02:46.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve got crappy one what happens when I</p>

<p begin="01:55:28.190" end="01:55:37.280" style="s2">seems slower okay well we had the other</p>

<p begin="02:01:48.710" end="02:01:52.450" style="s2">we let it optimize frames</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.130" end="02:02:00.440" style="s2">it actually looks literally at now able</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.600" end="02:02:04.190" style="s2">to get along</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.440" end="02:02:04.880" style="s2">so maybe slower let&#39;s just look so doing</p>

<p begin="02:02:04.880" end="02:02:09.130" style="s2">why am I getting those bumps</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.820" end="02:02:19.500" style="s2">why does that look like crap the errors</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.810" end="02:02:19.500" style="s2">are not that high</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.469" end="02:02:31.380" style="s2">they&#39;re staying at like 13,000 they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:02:31.380" end="02:02:39.420" style="s2">still there&#39;s less errors than edges</p>

<p begin="02:02:39.420" end="02:02:44.370" style="s2">don&#39;t run it out to my friends let&#39;s see</p>

<p begin="02:03:28.150" end="02:03:33.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t agree better I&#39;ll clear this up</p>

<p begin="02:09:11.800" end="02:09:18.570" style="s2">but it globally optimizes and that it</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.650" end="02:09:18.570" style="s2">just like shoves the frame back there</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.070" end="02:09:34.210" style="s2">I just jobs</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.239" end="02:09:44.050" style="s2">big jump on that one it&#39;s not even pose</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.030" end="02:09:44.050" style="s2">optimizing edge</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.200" end="02:09:59.950" style="s2">and this is without a local window tel</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.700" end="02:10:02.650" style="s2">just will actually move all of them the</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.950" end="02:10:04.210" style="s2">optimizer decides that&#39;s the best see</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.650" end="02:10:09.150" style="s2">just jumps back there I love this look</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.210" end="02:10:09.150" style="s2">at that gap why does that happen</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.179" end="02:10:50.970" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.410" end="02:10:53.420" style="s2">it moves them and then it just jumps</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.970" end="02:10:53.420" style="s2">right back</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.920" end="02:10:59.060" style="s2">well 50s and I helping anybody</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.490" end="02:11:20.340" style="s2">we do only paint the map after we</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.740" end="02:11:23.220" style="s2">display it sometimes we don&#39;t run that</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.340" end="02:11:27.720" style="s2">optimizer the kinematic model is</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.220" end="02:11:35.570" style="s2">disabled right now and f 2 dot pose will</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.720" end="02:11:35.570" style="s2">actually change definitely right</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.010" end="02:11:59.600" style="s2">it&#39;s still doing it</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.949" end="02:12:07.380" style="s2">- jumping back look at the jumps</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.630" end="02:12:28.230" style="s2">that&#39;s without you pose optimization</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.040" end="02:12:38.600" style="s2">that&#39;s just using fundamental matrices B</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.230" end="02:12:38.600" style="s2">dot F 2 dot oh yeah that right there</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.090" end="02:13:15.479" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.139" end="02:13:26.610" style="s2">okay runs the optimizer that should be</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.340" end="02:13:30.940" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.670" end="02:13:40.280" style="s2">we&#39;re praying the universe of the post</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.050" end="02:13:44.960" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m from University that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.280" end="02:13:44.960" style="s2">since the FS that&#39;s the transform from</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.080" end="02:14:13.490" style="s2">there there there there I went backwards</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.120" end="02:14:32.480" style="s2">there&#39;s backwards why did it do that</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.510" end="02:14:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand there</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.510" end="02:14:40.380" style="s2">guys see it look goes forwards and then</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.110" end="02:14:46.950" style="s2">it goes backwards I&#39;m totally backwards</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.380" end="02:14:49.680" style="s2">slicked down why did that happen</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.950" end="02:15:06.810" style="s2">look at that you can see it better from</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.680" end="02:15:08.340" style="s2">this side down right there right there</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.810" end="02:15:09.450" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to be after pose</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.340" end="02:15:13.710" style="s2">optimization</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.450" end="02:15:17.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t do pose optimization but one of</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.710" end="02:15:17.630" style="s2">it was one of the RT matrices cared</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.640" end="02:15:40.739" style="s2">know that look at that bad frame went</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.140" end="02:16:03.630" style="s2">there that&#39;s wrong I didn&#39;t do it that</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.739" end="02:16:06.199" style="s2">time it did the down there so putting in</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.630" end="02:16:06.199" style="s2">the ground truth</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.280" end="02:16:24.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s jumping down do it I don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.220" end="02:16:27.100" style="s2">in the ground truth just move them all</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.230" end="02:16:27.100" style="s2">gently down</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.929" end="02:16:51.000" style="s2">moving sideways cow</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.010" end="02:16:57.920" style="s2">don&#39;t Optima still do that but you know</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.260" end="02:16:57.920" style="s2">because if I don&#39;t laugh</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.030" end="02:17:20.961" style="s2">but who wants to move that one down why</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.560" end="02:17:22.310" style="s2">are those points such garbage I see you</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.961" end="02:17:27.010" style="s2"> but when you talk about</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.310" end="02:17:27.010" style="s2">self-driving cars and , I don&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.320" end="02:17:46.451" style="s2">don&#39;t forget it moves it down why does</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.680" end="02:17:46.451" style="s2">it think it&#39;s more down than it is</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.110" end="02:17:58.450" style="s2">okay it does vaguely look to me like it</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.490" end="02:17:58.450" style="s2">actually did move down</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.300" end="02:18:13.660" style="s2">look at that</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.290" end="02:18:32.369" style="s2">- both optimizers - it does it even more</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.000" end="02:18:43.510" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first frame right after we</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.309" end="02:18:43.510" style="s2">did a global bundle adjustment</p>
<p begin="02:19:00.090" end="02:19:05.670" style="s2">that just set let&#39;s see the problem I</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.730" end="02:19:15.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want to try another video like</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.010" end="02:19:22.210" style="s2">that didn&#39;t move down that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.160" end="02:19:24.400" style="s2">sense that matrix said it didn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.210" end="02:19:28.230" style="s2">down this matrix said it didn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.400" end="02:19:28.230" style="s2">down how did it move down</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.700" end="02:19:37.320" style="s2">then my output here is that&#39;s down well</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.160" end="02:19:40.800" style="s2">no that&#39;s all wrong access yeah look my</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.320" end="02:19:43.950" style="s2">upper here is 62 does it make sense good</p>
<p begin="02:19:40.800" end="02:19:46.380" style="s2">it didn&#39;t run the optimizer and the last</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.950" end="02:19:48.090" style="s2">pose was this okay</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.380" end="02:19:53.271" style="s2">something weirds going on here you guys</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.090" end="02:19:58.260" style="s2">see what&#39;s up notice how this one is</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.271" end="02:20:01.880" style="s2">point O 4 then we dotted with 0.05 which</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.260" end="02:20:01.880" style="s2">is what should give me the pose here</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.790" end="02:20:16.340" style="s2">wait - 48 we think about my corner</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.700" end="02:20:20.420" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.340" end="02:20:24.240" style="s2">so yeah wait how did that get minus 48</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.420" end="02:20:28.891" style="s2">how did that get 60 - that&#39;s the bigger</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.240" end="02:20:31.970" style="s2">question alright cuz this and this does</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.891" end="02:20:31.970" style="s2">not 60 to make</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.130" end="02:20:44.830" style="s2">how is that at all different from that</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.110" end="02:20:49.311" style="s2">didn&#39;t even run another optimizer</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.830" end="02:20:53.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no pose optimizer right oh we</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.311" end="02:20:55.940" style="s2">have ground truth for the pose oh okay I</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.780" end="02:20:59.630" style="s2">see what&#39;s going on it&#39;s using the</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.940" end="02:21:01.670" style="s2">ground truth the OP okay sorry I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.630" end="02:21:04.431" style="s2">dumb the optimizer is moving it away</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.670" end="02:21:05.900" style="s2">from the ground truth Bob and then the</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.431" end="02:21:08.540" style="s2">ground truth comes back and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.900" end="02:21:10.311" style="s2">it&#39;s actually there right I&#39;m not using</p>
<p begin="02:21:08.540" end="02:21:11.570" style="s2">like the differences from the ground</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.311" end="02:21:16.311" style="s2">truth I&#39;m using the ground truth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.570" end="02:21:25.370" style="s2">sell okay well that explains the mystery</p>
<p begin="02:21:16.311" end="02:21:27.891" style="s2">at least okay electricity PPS mysteries</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.370" end="02:21:29.750" style="s2">over that line that was pretty sick all</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.891" end="02:21:31.761" style="s2">right so now we&#39;re just left with the</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.750" end="02:21:35.540" style="s2">question of why the optimizer makes the</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.761" end="02:21:44.540" style="s2">frames go there I mean that&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.540" end="02:21:52.221" style="s2">more banal question that seems less like</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.540" end="02:21:53.391" style="s2">a bug and more like by</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.221" end="02:21:59.540" style="s2">I mean you know those things that we</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.391" end="02:22:03.221" style="s2">can&#39;t really fix see that looks better</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.540" end="02:22:03.221" style="s2">but now the points look crappier</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.010" end="02:22:11.090" style="s2">all these crappy points but these can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:08.520" end="02:22:11.090" style="s2">have good</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.420" end="02:22:15.710" style="s2">these can&#39;t have good losses</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.570" end="02:22:44.210" style="s2">relax these ones that are like zero and</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.021" end="02:22:50.900" style="s2">wanna like okay well I think that is</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.210" end="02:22:53.650" style="s2">their depth but I can&#39;t tell too much</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.900" end="02:22:53.650" style="s2">about them</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.750" end="02:23:34.540" style="s2">you know we&#39;re gonna pause after you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.860" end="02:23:37.630" style="s2">in adoption so this is what the</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.540" end="02:23:40.271" style="s2">optimizer outputs yeah like these guys</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.630" end="02:23:45.030" style="s2">should be pruned at that point where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.271" end="02:23:45.030" style="s2">that point there that should be proved</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.530" end="02:24:01.200" style="s2">called 20 points and call way more</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.931" end="02:24:01.200" style="s2">points that only left in crap</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.180" end="02:24:16.970" style="s2">yeah we delete it if the error is large</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.680" end="02:24:39.500" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.970" end="02:24:57.380" style="s2">so the problem like these others has</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.500" end="02:24:58.700" style="s2">something to do with that family just</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.380" end="02:25:01.840" style="s2">some of the really crappy ones notice</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.700" end="02:25:07.300" style="s2">how some of the points I didn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.840" end="02:25:07.300" style="s2">those ones didn&#39;t move in a garbage</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.540" end="02:25:16.021" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why the pruna didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.580" end="02:25:16.021" style="s2">those look at those garbage</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.439" end="02:25:32.310" style="s2">okay I&#39;m just I&#39;m just doing the</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.090" end="02:25:32.310" style="s2">purchase a straight-up normal projection</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.010" end="02:25:54.010" style="s2">so after I put the frame pose back so</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.450" end="02:26:09.700" style="s2">that&#39;s right all the ones that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.010" end="02:26:13.660" style="s2">move it just garbage okay they might</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.700" end="02:26:15.729" style="s2">only exist in two frames and somehow</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.660" end="02:26:25.000" style="s2">like the two frames have their match</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.729" end="02:26:39.910" style="s2">somewhere reasonable they will go away</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.000" end="02:26:42.880" style="s2">eventually maybe okay it does remove</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.910" end="02:26:44.229" style="s2">them eventually if they&#39;re not seen in</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.880" end="02:26:49.560" style="s2">multiple frames so those are just</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.229" end="02:26:49.560" style="s2">outliers in an optimization</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.030" end="02:27:18.560" style="s2">these are the estimated depth of the</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.350" end="02:27:30.290" style="s2">points some of them are really huge</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.560" end="02:27:33.230" style="s2">we should filter those out or asked some</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.290" end="02:27:37.750" style="s2">- who&#39;s greater than say a thousand I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.230" end="02:27:42.800" style="s2">stamping within a thousand away well</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.750" end="02:27:45.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not really right we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.800" end="02:27:45.670" style="s2">it for now but</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.859" end="02:28:03.689" style="s2">it&#39;s not helping with anything okay</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.310" end="02:28:10.410" style="s2">we&#39;re more aggressively prune on</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.689" end="02:28:15.140" style="s2">reprojection these points are all still</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.410" end="02:28:15.140" style="s2">in garbage garbage</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.250" end="02:28:33.689" style="s2">how&#39;s that trash points Tanner out</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.770" end="02:28:38.760" style="s2">alright let&#39;s get more aggressive</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.811" end="02:29:03.330" style="s2">it does look like most of the trash</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.641" end="02:29:03.330" style="s2">vanishes</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.079" end="02:29:24.949" style="s2">trash just shows up look at all that</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.149" end="02:29:29.420" style="s2">well but there&#39;s not much parallax there</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.949" end="02:29:33.949" style="s2">is the problem so that&#39;s actual filter</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.420" end="02:29:36.619" style="s2">we can do better all these new points</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.949" end="02:29:41.149" style="s2">that aren&#39;t found they&#39;re not found</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.619" end="02:29:43.970" style="s2">search by projection may be more lenient</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.149" end="02:29:46.720" style="s2">on my search by projections or my search</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.970" end="02:29:46.720" style="s2">by projections</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.710" end="02:30:05.610" style="s2">that looks better</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.350" end="02:30:15.990" style="s2">yeah more leniency on the searchbar</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.360" end="02:30:15.990" style="s2">projections</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.300" end="02:30:30.650" style="s2">getting all of that crap though well</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.910" end="02:30:37.061" style="s2">that can be done by such by projection</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.650" end="02:30:37.061" style="s2">really it&#39;s like speckle speckle</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.600" end="02:30:41.540" style="s2">those points get found with search by</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.370" end="02:30:44.210" style="s2">projection they shouldn&#39;t be used</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.540" end="02:30:53.870" style="s2">anywhere if they shouldn&#39;t be out of the</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.210" end="02:30:55.340" style="s2">map ever well it&#39;s not really true yeah</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.870" end="02:31:02.470" style="s2">considered the trade opportunity that</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.340" end="02:31:02.470" style="s2">after search by projection these matches</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.960" end="02:31:11.890" style="s2">back get rid of the speckle</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.810" end="02:31:28.480" style="s2">we didn&#39;t do any profiling I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.320" end="02:31:28.480" style="s2"> spackle man holy</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.301" end="02:31:43.741" style="s2">garbage like Oh a garbage has showed up</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.741" end="02:31:43.741" style="s2">garbage man Bronx Zoo quality</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.130" end="02:31:50.950" style="s2">your box is pretty much is it true</p>
<p begin="02:32:08.919" end="02:32:14.999" style="s2">the speckle it&#39;s staying in the map</p>
<p begin="02:32:12.369" end="02:32:14.999" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.479" end="02:32:31.630" style="s2">I guess it just finds it in all the</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.609" end="02:32:35.350" style="s2">frames and like that&#39;s okay hmm speckle</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.630" end="02:32:35.350" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.500" end="02:32:53.330" style="s2">well it&#39;s better when I let the Abdul</p>
<p begin="02:32:51.950" end="02:32:55.130" style="s2">observations of the point is already</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.330" end="02:32:57.609" style="s2">observed in the previous frame okay</p>
<p begin="02:32:55.130" end="02:32:57.609" style="s2">that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.310" end="02:33:18.659" style="s2">you don&#39;t judge they&#39;re not aggressive</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.369" end="02:33:42.479" style="s2">this one do this and that&#39;s a less</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.399" end="02:33:42.479" style="s2">aggressive filter hoops no points anyone</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.190" end="02:34:00.421" style="s2">I think those are the checks that orb</p>
<p begin="02:33:58.290" end="02:34:14.641" style="s2">slam is doing that are pretty good but I</p>
<p begin="02:34:00.421" end="02:34:19.620" style="s2">don&#39;t have right now this is also wrong</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.641" end="02:34:21.511" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t do this this is garbage</p>
<p begin="02:34:19.620" end="02:34:24.051" style="s2">I wanna see if any descriptors I want to</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.511" end="02:34:24.051" style="s2">find the best</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.830" end="02:34:58.930" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s just a now that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="02:35:15.311" end="02:35:20.170" style="s2">so like the problem with this is this</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.471" end="02:35:24.400" style="s2">can actually add multiple observations</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.170" end="02:35:25.240" style="s2">of the same point as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.400" end="02:35:28.771" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.240" end="02:35:31.540" style="s2">well not not at the same point but</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.771" end="02:35:48.450" style="s2">because that break is just breaking or</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.540" end="02:35:48.450" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a bug yeah I see the problem</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.610" end="02:36:19.120" style="s2">so first we can just say be desk so but</p>
<p begin="02:36:17.170" end="02:36:28.620" style="s2">the problem is that we can actually</p>
<p begin="02:36:19.120" end="02:36:32.500" style="s2">match it with multiple things next</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.620" end="02:36:34.360" style="s2">observation all right well that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="02:36:32.500" end="02:36:41.710" style="s2">least gonna fix it to what it was before</p>
<p begin="02:36:34.360" end="02:36:47.141" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s a vodka that might have been</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.710" end="02:36:52.511" style="s2">why was crashing - we should add a</p>
<p begin="02:36:47.141" end="02:36:58.471" style="s2">check for that me okay</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.511" end="02:36:58.471" style="s2">so effectively what this is is</p>
<p begin="02:37:05.790" end="02:37:15.790" style="s2">okay the the bug was that multiple</p>
<p begin="02:37:12.480" end="02:37:23.410" style="s2">points were being observed multiple</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.790" end="02:37:26.230" style="s2">times in the same frame this is just</p>
<p begin="02:37:23.410" end="02:37:27.851" style="s2">going to work Randy that was with the</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.230" end="02:37:30.420" style="s2">bug less like the structure the graph</p>
<p begin="02:37:27.851" end="02:37:30.420" style="s2">was weird</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.470" end="02:38:50.249" style="s2">oh my assertion fails that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:39:25.529" end="02:39:46.060" style="s2">object of type math has no leg yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.229" end="02:39:53.050" style="s2">being added multiple sources in afraid</p>
<p begin="02:39:46.060" end="02:40:00.119" style="s2">oh god okay so the question how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:53.050" end="02:40:00.119" style="s2">happening no we gotta with sierpinski a</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.999" end="02:40:08.470" style="s2">point can&#39;t be observed multiple times</p>
<p begin="02:40:05.350" end="02:40:11.760" style="s2">in French so as the problem in search by</p>
<p begin="02:40:08.470" end="02:40:15.579" style="s2">projection I&#39;m gonna route and find out</p>
<p begin="02:40:11.760" end="02:40:24.279" style="s2">yes it is so this still has the same</p>
<p begin="02:40:15.579" end="02:40:27.209" style="s2">bomb okay so you don&#39;t actually need</p>
<p begin="02:40:24.279" end="02:40:27.209" style="s2">that check but</p>
<p begin="02:40:40.950" end="02:40:56.220" style="s2">yeah okay so for the points for each</p>
<p begin="02:40:53.220" end="02:40:56.220" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="02:40:58.240" end="02:41:07.270" style="s2">yeah okay you see it can just be added</p>
<p begin="02:41:01.210" end="02:41:21.520" style="s2">multiple times that should fix that</p>
<p begin="02:41:07.270" end="02:41:26.140" style="s2">though if F points mi DX is not alright</p>
<p begin="02:41:21.520" end="02:41:31.450" style="s2">but my search by projection has who</p>
<p begin="02:41:26.140" end="02:41:33.580" style="s2">can find bug and win $1 $1 find the bug</p>
<p begin="02:41:31.450" end="02:41:35.680" style="s2">win $1 if I had then no ID then mo you</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.580" end="02:41:38.170" style="s2">but I don&#39;t cuz it&#39;s a Facebook product</p>
<p begin="02:41:35.680" end="02:41:41.460" style="s2">or something so you guys have a Facebook</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.170" end="02:41:41.460" style="s2">that Oh Facebook</p>
<p begin="02:41:43.920" end="02:41:50.310" style="s2">yeah errors are cut it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:41:50.760" end="02:41:56.740" style="s2">ok so this is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="02:41:52.780" end="02:42:02.350" style="s2">don&#39;t do search my projection we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:41:56.740" end="02:42:05.370" style="s2">really need it it&#39;s just bugged now I</p>
<p begin="02:42:02.350" end="02:42:08.290" style="s2">have an Instagram bro I got I&#39;m on insta</p>
<p begin="02:42:05.370" end="02:42:10.750" style="s2">idea idea I&#39;m Instagram models that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:42:08.290" end="02:42:15.510" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing Instagram and invite</p>
<p begin="02:42:10.750" end="02:42:15.510" style="s2">them to my palace in Dubai tag sponsor</p>
<p begin="02:42:24.830" end="02:42:32.720" style="s2">I so this is what happens that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:42:27.980" end="02:42:34.070" style="s2">do search better projection we won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="02:42:32.720" end="02:42:35.960" style="s2">for a projection now we just don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="02:42:34.070" end="02:42:37.390" style="s2">broken search by projection so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="02:42:35.960" end="02:42:45.320" style="s2">what&#39;s broken about it</p>
<p begin="02:42:37.390" end="02:42:55.010" style="s2">okay so first project all the map points</p>
<p begin="02:42:45.320" end="02:43:09.070" style="s2">into current so that&#39;s not really right</p>
<p begin="02:42:55.010" end="02:43:09.070" style="s2">but whatever only two points that fit</p>
<p begin="02:43:09.521" end="02:43:12.790" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="02:43:16.420" end="02:43:24.830" style="s2">don&#39;t post on my insta brows you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.000" end="02:43:26.689" style="s2">follow my secret in stuff psyche I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:43:24.830" end="02:43:27.140" style="s2">have a secret in stuff you got time that</p>
<p begin="02:43:26.689" end="02:43:35.529" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:43:27.140" end="02:43:38.659" style="s2">I don&#39;t sorry okay Katie query ballpoint</p>
<p begin="02:43:35.529" end="02:43:42.109" style="s2">so for each one we get all the points</p>
<p begin="02:43:38.659" end="02:43:46.479" style="s2">nearby in frame if the point is</p>
<p begin="02:43:42.109" end="02:43:48.979" style="s2">unmatched then we add the observation</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.479" end="02:43:51.760" style="s2">breakout now I don&#39;t get it that should</p>
<p begin="02:43:48.979" end="02:43:51.760" style="s2">actually be okay</p>
<p begin="02:44:01.470" end="02:44:06.010" style="s2">Frane points of ID x equals self</p>
<p begin="02:44:04.720" end="02:44:09.630" style="s2">so it actually shouldn&#39;t be able to add</p>
<p begin="02:44:06.010" end="02:44:09.630" style="s2">the observation twice I don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="02:44:36.210" end="02:44:47.290" style="s2">alright is also aggressive that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:44:44.770" end="02:44:48.760" style="s2">do it anymore it just takes longer okay</p>
<p begin="02:44:47.290" end="02:44:50.830" style="s2">well if you&#39;re gonna see a product make</p>
<p begin="02:44:48.760" end="02:45:04.600" style="s2">an appetizer you can change it to later</p>
<p begin="02:44:50.830" end="02:45:07.530" style="s2">a cert length of set IDs okay so the</p>
<p begin="02:45:04.600" end="02:45:07.530" style="s2">indexes</p>
<p begin="02:45:34.270" end="02:45:48.319" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that I&#39;m sure we listen to</p>
<p begin="02:45:41.600" end="02:45:51.289" style="s2">music listen to music now so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:45:48.319" end="02:45:54.109" style="s2">adding the observation to f1 multiple</p>
<p begin="02:45:51.289" end="02:45:59.449" style="s2">times that&#39;s what&#39;s happening so for a</p>
<p begin="02:45:54.109" end="02:46:02.739" style="s2">given point but if we have the</p>
<p begin="02:45:59.449" end="02:46:02.739" style="s2">observation should break</p>
<p begin="02:46:08.280" end="02:46:14.931" style="s2">should break out of that loop and we</p>
<p begin="02:46:11.490" end="02:46:14.931" style="s2">only get a write over the points once</p>
<p begin="02:46:39.340" end="02:46:47.830" style="s2">when one says p dot or just one factor</p>
<p begin="02:47:27.221" end="02:47:31.721" style="s2">that&#39;s clear I&#39;m gonna fix that um</p>
<p begin="02:47:39.770" end="02:47:47.040" style="s2">how is that happening</p>
<p begin="02:47:42.620" end="02:47:55.470" style="s2">f1 kt query ball points that gives us</p>
<p begin="02:47:47.040" end="02:47:55.979" style="s2">indices into the frame throw assert is</p>
<p begin="02:47:55.470" end="02:47:58.800" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="02:47:55.979" end="02:48:07.550" style="s2">you should people should have sir if</p>
<p begin="02:47:58.800" end="02:48:07.550" style="s2">unmatched the distance</p>
<p begin="02:48:10.801" end="02:48:16.320" style="s2">alright so the problem is actually that</p>
<p begin="02:48:13.021" end="02:48:20.601" style="s2">a point is being added multiple times to</p>
<p begin="02:48:16.320" end="02:48:20.601" style="s2">a frame the same point</p>
<p begin="02:48:25.811" end="02:48:32.771" style="s2">which I really don&#39;t understand because</p>
<p begin="02:48:29.870" end="02:48:32.771" style="s2">we only run this once</p>
<p begin="02:48:40.960" end="02:48:44.830" style="s2">Raja&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="02:49:05.520" end="02:49:09.930" style="s2">it&#39;s just a wave it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="02:49:08.460" end="02:49:16.770" style="s2">back to return every point you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:49:09.930" end="02:49:37.140" style="s2">do anything bad I just said that in that</p>
<p begin="02:49:16.770" end="02:49:38.640" style="s2">observation ha what&#39;s good so now we can</p>
<p begin="02:49:37.140" end="02:49:41.150" style="s2">remove that sanity check from the actus</p>
<p begin="02:49:38.640" end="02:49:41.150" style="s2">guys stupid</p>
<p begin="02:49:47.390" end="02:49:56.360" style="s2">so frame not itself alright so we are</p>
<p begin="02:49:50.130" end="02:49:56.360" style="s2">literally adding same thing twice</p>
<p begin="02:50:05.899" end="02:50:11.859" style="s2">No so it doesn&#39;t make that much sense</p>
<p begin="02:50:08.989" end="02:50:11.859" style="s2">cuz I&#39;ve never seen</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.070" end="02:50:24.551" style="s2">at that point somehow already has an</p>
<p begin="02:50:20.771" end="02:50:25.961" style="s2">observation in that frame understand</p>
<p begin="02:50:24.551" end="02:50:38.671" style="s2">explicit check for it</p>
<p begin="02:50:25.961" end="02:50:38.671" style="s2">oh I mean yeah you know I just there</p>
<p begin="02:50:46.710" end="02:50:51.300" style="s2">let me get it up there and I have it</p>
<p begin="02:50:48.870" end="02:50:58.729" style="s2">down there I mean there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.300" end="02:51:05.430" style="s2">stops it point unmatched</p>
<p begin="02:50:58.729" end="02:51:23.220" style="s2">and this point doesn&#39;t already have a</p>
<p begin="02:51:05.430" end="02:51:25.760" style="s2">match in the for me let&#39;s yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:51:23.220" end="02:51:27.810" style="s2">really understand why this is happening</p>
<p begin="02:51:25.760" end="02:51:29.100" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing useful for like</p>
<p begin="02:51:27.810" end="02:51:30.800" style="s2">desk times it was good for neural</p>
<p begin="02:51:29.100" end="02:51:33.120" style="s2">networks and that&#39;s pretty much it I</p>
<p begin="02:51:30.800" end="02:51:34.380" style="s2">mean you can try to right bundle just my</p>
<p begin="02:51:33.120" end="02:51:37.800" style="s2">tensor flow but don&#39;t do it&#39;ll work well</p>
<p begin="02:51:34.380" end="02:51:44.160" style="s2">I think actually have tried if you check</p>
<p begin="02:51:37.800" end="02:51:50.040" style="s2">my gist&#39;s okay alright alright so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:51:44.160" end="02:51:55.910" style="s2">the problem the point f1 point sub mi DX</p>
<p begin="02:51:50.040" end="02:51:55.910" style="s2">already has a match in the frame f1</p>
<p begin="02:51:58.430" end="02:52:10.550" style="s2">yet it&#39;s just not to mig access to some</p>
<p begin="02:52:01.369" end="02:52:13.369" style="s2">other point so although that point may</p>
<p begin="02:52:10.550" end="02:52:20.959" style="s2">not have a map oh god I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="02:52:13.369" end="02:52:28.310" style="s2">this self assert that the point is not</p>
<p begin="02:52:20.959" end="02:52:32.109" style="s2">matched and assert that the frame does</p>
<p begin="02:52:28.310" end="02:52:32.109" style="s2">not already have a link to this point</p>
<p begin="02:52:34.270" end="02:52:45.109" style="s2">how could a frame have a link to this</p>
<p begin="02:52:37.100" end="02:52:58.789" style="s2">point frame dot points uh by DX if I D X</p>
<p begin="02:52:45.109" end="02:53:01.699" style="s2">is something else are you paper there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:52:58.789" end="02:53:12.350" style="s2">a point here&#39;s a point it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="02:53:01.699" end="02:53:15.459" style="s2">point just added it multiple times to</p>
<p begin="02:53:12.350" end="02:53:15.459" style="s2">the frame somehow</p>
<p begin="02:53:19.641" end="02:53:22.950" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be so dumb about this I</p>
<p begin="02:53:21.811" end="02:53:38.700" style="s2">don&#39;t know why this is so hard to think</p>
<p begin="02:53:22.950" end="02:53:46.830" style="s2">about points of MIG axes yeah okay we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:53:38.700" end="02:54:16.070" style="s2">just put it up here if if F 1 in p dot</p>
<p begin="02:53:46.830" end="02:54:16.070" style="s2">frames continue already okay fix us up</p>
<p begin="02:54:26.070" end="02:54:53.761" style="s2">is there a chance that that even fixes</p>
<p begin="02:54:28.690" end="02:54:53.761" style="s2">the segfault nope it does not be sampled</p>
<p begin="02:55:00.450" end="02:55:05.461" style="s2">go get some mati that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:55:02.830" end="02:55:05.461" style="s2">talking about right</p>
<p begin="02:55:06.900" end="02:55:13.391" style="s2">we&#39;ve already matched this map point to</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.301" end="02:55:15.221" style="s2">this frame I mean it&#39;s a map point yeah</p>
<p begin="02:55:13.391" end="02:55:18.001" style="s2">right so of course it can already be</p>
<p begin="02:55:15.221" end="02:55:18.001" style="s2">match to this frame</p>
<p begin="02:55:46.760" end="02:55:50.790" style="s2">if you have to reopen and you close that</p>
<p begin="02:55:49.620" end="02:55:53.270" style="s2">and try it again</p>
