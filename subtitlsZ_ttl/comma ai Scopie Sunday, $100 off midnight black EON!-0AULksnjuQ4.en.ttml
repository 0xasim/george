<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:52.930" style="s2">the battery campus encryption yeah way</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.000" end="00:20:54.160" style="s2">he&#39;s touring the key small big model</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.930" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re the small big model right</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.160" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">you think it&#39;s an oxymoron but it&#39;s real</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:31.700" style="s2">only make model on CPU no Krispies you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.830" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">want to see you guys here training</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.700" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">computer lessons ancient or any computer</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.020" end="00:21:54.260" style="s2">oh here we are at my prompt ssh GPU</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.630" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">slave double zero yeah look at them we</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.260" end="00:22:00.290" style="s2">got ten we&#39;ve got ten ten sixties in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">there they&#39;re working on training a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.290" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">different big model right now where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">playing with some high prefer a meters</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:07.580" style="s2">I&#39;m playing I&#39;m removing the dropout and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:10.040" style="s2">seeing if we have enough gated actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.580" end="00:22:11.929" style="s2">just not used dropout at all I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.040" end="00:22:13.550" style="s2">write it it&#39;s called Nvidia semi but</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.929" end="00:22:14.390" style="s2">yeah so we got we got an army of GPUs</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.550" end="00:22:19.160" style="s2">down there</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.390" end="00:22:22.910" style="s2">oh the comment ASCII oh yeah yeah go</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.160" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">sorry for the masses right we got yeah</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">thought inside was too many secrets yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.679" end="00:22:40.850" style="s2">well I hate some of the secrets when and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:42.890" style="s2">how did I learn them now you guys will</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.850" end="00:22:46.340" style="s2">see when big model comes out um new</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.890" end="00:22:49.370" style="s2">calibration is is probably you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.340" end="00:22:51.410" style="s2">you&#39;ll see what harmonica do it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.370" end="00:22:54.980" style="s2">cool the other thing that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.410" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">on is the cutting problem so small model</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.980" end="00:22:58.850" style="s2">can&#39;t see the cuttings but big model</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:00.230" style="s2">should be able to big model should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.850" end="00:23:02.540" style="s2">able to see if there&#39;s a car merging</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:03.530" style="s2">over into your legs the radar has a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.540" end="00:23:05.720" style="s2">narrow field of view</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.530" end="00:23:07.250" style="s2">um the camera neon has a pretty wide</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.720" end="00:23:09.559" style="s2">field here it&#39;s actually like 70 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.250" end="00:23:11.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s enough to see cuttings but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.559" end="00:23:13.190" style="s2">model right now can&#39;t see them because</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.420" end="00:23:19.640" style="s2">it&#39;s small model you know everything is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.190" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">better in big model big model and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.640" end="00:23:25.309" style="s2">also it&#39;s a much more modern machine</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:26.929" style="s2">learning architecture so like small</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.309" end="00:23:28.970" style="s2">model is not that different from the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.929" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">we started out with when Connie I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.970" end="00:23:36.890" style="s2">started big mall is a its exception it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:38.390" style="s2">based on exception so we got those what</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.890" end="00:23:41.300" style="s2">do they call those stupid convolutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.390" end="00:23:43.250" style="s2">depth-wise separable convolutions so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.300" end="00:23:44.430" style="s2">have I could calm if you have like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.250" end="00:23:48.570" style="s2">three by three columns</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.430" end="00:23:49.950" style="s2">and it has a bunch of channels can it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.570" end="00:23:55.290" style="s2">play crisis that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.950" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">oh yeah people merging in yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.290" end="00:23:58.650" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">what&#39;s the predicted support timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.650" end="00:24:01.920" style="s2">for an eon who said there was support</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:15.180" style="s2">did someone tell you there was support</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.400" end="00:24:23.100" style="s2">Aeon put this way the Aeon compatible</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.180" end="00:24:25.560" style="s2">code base will be sold all through next</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.100" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">year as well we can definitely fix</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.560" end="00:24:29.130" style="s2">cartons with video I&#39;m kid big mobile</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:31.230" style="s2">identify box sorry that&#39;s not with big</p>
