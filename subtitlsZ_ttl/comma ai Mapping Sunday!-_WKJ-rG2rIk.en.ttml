<p begin="00:00:08.950" end="00:00:13.349" style="s2">guys like the last mapping ones so I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.339" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">say what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:28.790" style="s2">yeah yeah I think you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">because I think if this loses the track</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.790" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">then it&#39;s not gonna work but as long as</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">here we have an actual 3d map so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">the same stuff that I was using to map</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:35.399" style="s2">the roads except here it&#39;s a map of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">room so if I tilt it up you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.399" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">tilt up okay I&#39;ll make landscape sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">locked the rotation on my phone who</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lock the rotation on that phone</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">yeah but so this technology is coming to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">all your yawns very soon and then</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">coverage this is going to give us ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.569" end="00:02:05.329" style="s2">centimeters yeah new chair it&#39;s squeaky</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">knows that comma pedals are light blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:34.860" style="s2">a little LED blinking here tonight look</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:36.660" style="s2">at that look so this is a common pedal</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.860" end="00:02:39.270" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been working on so that firmer</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.660" end="00:02:40.709" style="s2">is pretty much done notice that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.709" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">is a comedy bug</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;re using it just exploded</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:58.020" style="s2">exciting is the mapping is the mapping</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">and uh yes here&#39;s oh I guess I need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.020" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">show you guys what was actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.390" style="s2">the mapping here&#39;s an e on just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:14.519" style="s2">on my desk again plugged into a comedy</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.390" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">bug yeah so now when I rotate this see</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.519" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">it map in real time over here yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:28.230" style="s2">the mapping is exciting so I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">showed you guys in the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">late-night sundae mapping periscope</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:33.829" style="s2">about how this actually works on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">roads</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.829" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">orab slim doesn&#39;t really work on a road</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">but if you combine it if you combine</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:44.030" style="s2">these features let&#39;s see the features</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">over here if you combine the features</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.030" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">it&#39;s me and orb if you combine the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:53.549" style="s2">features with all the other stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">so what we found with the radar is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.549" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">problem with the radars is that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">have internal Kalman filters and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.870" style="s2">we&#39;re putting that measurement into our</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:06.510" style="s2">Calvin filter you can&#39;t double Kalman</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.870" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">filter like that unless we knew the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.510" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">standard deviation from the raters which</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">we don&#39;t um obviously shame shame on</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:15.010" style="s2">these radar people you know every time</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">like Tesla autopilot</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.010" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">accidents where it hits a stop car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:24.600" style="s2">really it&#39;s the radar like you can do a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">much better job with this you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.600" end="00:04:32.440" style="s2">radars killed a few people it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:35.979" style="s2">common radar I don&#39;t know so you want</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.440" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">you want to talk about um the visual</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.979" end="00:04:40.600" style="s2">spectrum and why lidar is stupid I kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">of think actively emitting photons on</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.600" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">any spectrum is kind of stupid what do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:48.220" style="s2">need to act the photons for look at what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:50.440" style="s2">I have working right and like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.220" end="00:04:52.060" style="s2">like this demo is not I built this demo</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.440" end="00:04:54.070" style="s2">on a signal see for you guys this one</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.060" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">over on the left here I just piped the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.070" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">frames into uh into a modified version</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:02.139" style="s2">of orb slam but yeah you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">attracted this isn&#39;t using behind you or</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.139" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">anything we&#39;re working on the night is</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">well look it&#39;s me on the periscope</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">filming you it&#39;s like a triangle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned how to play chess you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:27.699" style="s2">was reading about triangulating your</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.320" end="00:05:30.580" style="s2">queen in the endgame triangulating yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.699" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be functioning um dude like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.580" end="00:05:36.220" style="s2">honestly do we build things we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:38.440" style="s2">ship this is all gonna ship with with</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.220" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">the big gray Panda update and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.440" end="00:05:41.710" style="s2">gonna start making precision maps and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:45.310" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start real oka lysing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.710" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">and your precision maps so some of y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.310" end="00:05:53.530" style="s2">are gonna be part of the vakama commuter</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.530" end="00:05:57.190" style="s2">yeah needs to download map data I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.150" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">still be downloading map data from our</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.190" end="00:06:01.690" style="s2">servers like I&#39;ve said our maps are</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">gonna be open source the stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.690" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">starting to work really well if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.509" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">mean here&#39;s why right so what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.419" end="00:08:26.110" style="s2">these mapping companies are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:28.750" style="s2">they are spending a lot of money to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.110" end="00:08:31.750" style="s2">build one map and to try to maintain it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.750" end="00:08:34.539" style="s2">right so their overhead for mapping is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.750" end="00:08:36.940" style="s2">is very high our overhead for mapping is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.539" end="00:08:38.740" style="s2">actually negative we&#39;re providing value</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.940" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">to the users who map for us in the form</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.740" end="00:08:42.760" style="s2">of open pilot right so you get open</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.760" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">maps I think that&#39;s a pretty good deal</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.750" end="00:14:54.040" style="s2">need torque you can limit the torque</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:55.900" style="s2">based on where you are in the map and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.040" end="00:14:58.810" style="s2">this is a great safe way to roll out</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:15:01.710" style="s2">higher torques so we can we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.810" end="00:15:05.650" style="s2">about that if you don&#39;t have a platform</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.710" end="00:15:09.310" style="s2">ie Tesla car itself Tech&#39;s less sticks</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.670" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">so what car are we gonna launch on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.640" end="00:15:35.320" style="s2">Honda&#39;s and the Toyotas and maybe also</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">of the tasarov I see some great progress</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.339" end="00:16:00.220" style="s2">car hacking going on right now we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:01.930" style="s2">always doing car hacking you guys want</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.220" end="00:16:05.140" style="s2">to see a pre CC you I&#39;ll show you guys a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.930" end="00:16:06.640" style="s2">Prius steering controller what pothole</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.140" end="00:16:10.089" style="s2">detection well yeah who likes potholes</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.640" end="00:16:12.850" style="s2">man no not infinity check it out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.089" end="00:16:14.830" style="s2">really cute actually he this is the ECU</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.850" end="00:16:17.050" style="s2">the Toyota uses for all the steering um</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.830" end="00:16:20.290" style="s2">so what you&#39;ll find if you look at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.050" end="00:16:23.170" style="s2">is the guy over here is where the power</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:25.030" style="s2">comes in this one here is where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.170" end="00:16:28.510" style="s2">motor goes out and notice how many wires</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.030" end="00:16:30.700" style="s2">it has it has two so it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.510" end="00:16:32.980" style="s2">Toyota&#39;s using like just a brushed motor</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.700" end="00:16:34.390" style="s2">um which is a little sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.980" end="00:16:35.589" style="s2">I mean the reason to brush motor is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.390" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">little sketchy is because if you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.589" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">that latch up that&#39;s kind of a playful</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.990" end="00:16:42.280" style="s2">torque to the motor which isn&#39;t great</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.760" end="00:16:44.080" style="s2">especially also this thing oh it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.280" end="00:16:46.390" style="s2">have a relay okay alright so it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.080" end="00:16:48.070" style="s2">have a lockout relay here you can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.390" end="00:16:49.810" style="s2">this relay I think that that is locking</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.070" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">out the fats to prevent that latch up so</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.810" end="00:16:52.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:54.070" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a bit of safety in here</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.570" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">which is good but you know brushless</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.070" end="00:16:57.370" style="s2">motors are inherently more safe than</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.100" style="s2">brushed motors because if you get fetch</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.370" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">feta you don&#39;t you get like weird</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.100" end="00:17:03.030" style="s2">behavior but you&#39;re not going to get you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:06.330" style="s2">know slamming the steering wheel to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.030" end="00:17:08.670" style="s2">left or to the right so then you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.330" end="00:17:11.220" style="s2">right here this port is where you plug</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.670" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">in the torque sensor and this port here</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.220" end="00:17:16.440" style="s2">is where you plug in the power and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:18.360" style="s2">can and these are the little cute Toyota</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.440" end="00:17:19.740" style="s2">steering controllers that look like</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.360" end="00:17:21.960" style="s2">they&#39;re in most of the new Toyota so</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.740" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">it&#39;s nice I don&#39;t know what chips</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.960" end="00:17:27.150" style="s2">actually in here this one looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:29.190" style="s2">FET driver this one is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.150" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">microcontroller running the code so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.190" end="00:17:34.860" style="s2">Prius has parking assist I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.180" style="s2">why this is only in the Prius I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.860" end="00:17:38.010" style="s2">know why this isn&#39;t in the other cars</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.180" end="00:17:39.450" style="s2">I&#39;m so the Prius you can actually put a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.010" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">lot of torque on the steering wheel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.450" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">enough torque to do South Park but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s the steering column</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s different but the Prius does have</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:49.170" style="s2">other weird qualities so maybe there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.930" style="s2">some differences in the steering column</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.170" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">I didn&#39;t build this house I didn&#39;t hang</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.930" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">the chandeliers</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">I do like another kind of nice right</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:02.340" style="s2">yeah Prius ECU</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.670" end="00:18:05.010" style="s2">here&#39;s another Prius CCO this is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.340" end="00:18:06.540" style="s2">hybrid controller Prius ECU this is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.010" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">one that I bricked well this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:09.750" style="s2">one that I bricked this is the spare now</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:11.940" style="s2">in case I break it again but I own brick</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.750" end="00:18:13.260" style="s2">tit so it&#39;s all good yeah the ref will</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.940" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">just have ultrasonic it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.260" end="00:18:16.410" style="s2">active Park Assist it can&#39;t like spin</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:18.870" style="s2">the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.410" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">am I still into iDevice hacking I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">couldn&#39;t care less</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:27.570" style="s2">i device hacking had its time back when</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:30.660" style="s2">phones were bad in 2007 phones were bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.570" end="00:18:31.860" style="s2">you needed to hack them 2008 phones were</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.660" end="00:18:35.160" style="s2">bad you needed to hack them you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.860" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">with bad in 2018 cars that&#39;s why we had</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.160" end="00:18:40.230" style="s2">cars gotta make cars good how did i</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">brick it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.230" end="00:18:46.920" style="s2">I did I forgot it I missed a checksum</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">all the Toyota code when you add it all</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.920" end="00:18:54.930" style="s2">together needs to add to a a 5/5 I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:39.020" style="s2">great and like what it gives us is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:41.540" style="s2">feedback um if we&#39;re shipping</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.020" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">you guys will tell us right if Zook</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.540" end="00:27:46.760" style="s2">spends their days doing who</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:48.920" style="s2">tells them right so by actually shipping</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.760" end="00:27:51.560" style="s2">and by closing that feedback loop it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.920" end="00:27:53.420" style="s2">gives us a really cool advantage that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.560" end="00:27:58.340" style="s2">mean who else has that advantage like</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.420" end="00:27:59.990" style="s2">Tesla alright now I can talk about where</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.340" end="00:28:02.330" style="s2">Tesla stopped and why there haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.990" end="00:28:04.160" style="s2">autopilot updates lately I think what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.330" end="00:28:05.450" style="s2">Tesla&#39;s done over the last year is built</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.160" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve been building from</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.450" end="00:28:09.320" style="s2">day one and that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:10.599" style="s2">infrastructure to gather all the videos</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.320" end="00:28:12.529" style="s2">from the car</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.599" end="00:28:13.849" style="s2">because you know Tesla just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.529" end="00:28:16.999" style="s2">really have the kind of training data</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.849" end="00:28:18.859" style="s2">they needed yeah yeah I feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.999" end="00:28:20.359" style="s2">the current sensor suite it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.859" end="00:28:23.629" style="s2">single camera we have another sensor</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.359" end="00:28:24.619" style="s2">that we&#39;ve shipped obviously you guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.629" end="00:28:27.019" style="s2">know what it is who knows what the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.619" end="00:28:30.919" style="s2">sensor is the sensor I promised it for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.019" end="00:28:32.479" style="s2">while I will do that self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.919" end="00:28:34.429" style="s2">awareness to again next year and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.479" end="00:28:35.989" style="s2">have less disengagement that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.429" end="00:28:38.389" style="s2">that like that stuff&#39;s kind of gimmicky</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.989" end="00:28:40.669" style="s2">too like rice it for one GPS exactly um</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.389" end="00:28:42.830" style="s2">so we shipped the gray panda which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.669" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">another sensor in conjunction with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.830" end="00:28:49.669" style="s2">open-source comma AI map yeah so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:51.769" style="s2">gonna get that great sensor as well if</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.669" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">you haven&#39;t if you have great panda and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.769" end="00:28:56.719" style="s2">an internet connection you get a second</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">sensor after the single camera no</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.719" end="00:28:59.989" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously some stuff you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:02.089" style="s2">do with a single camera and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.989" end="00:29:03.259" style="s2">but we do still feel good about it till</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.089" end="00:29:05.089" style="s2">the end of the year there&#39;s a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.259" end="00:29:07.399" style="s2">of the problem to solve on a single</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.089" end="00:29:11.749" style="s2">camera and you guys know we&#39;re cellphone</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.399" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">company right first year the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.749" end="00:29:16.369" style="s2">first year of karma I we built the comma</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:20.059" style="s2">zero I showed it to Bloomberg the second</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.369" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">year we built the comma neo then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.059" end="00:29:23.809" style="s2">called it the well we built two comma</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.570" style="s2">one and we called it the Neo when we</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.809" end="00:29:30.469" style="s2">shipped last year we built the comma E</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.570" end="00:29:34.580" style="s2">on so next year we&#39;ll build the comma</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.469" end="00:29:35.989" style="s2">three right yes we&#39;re cell phone company</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.580" end="00:29:37.609" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to ship new hardware every</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.989" end="00:29:39.589" style="s2">year just like any cell phone company</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.609" end="00:29:41.269" style="s2">will continue hopefully to support the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.589" end="00:29:43.429" style="s2">old hardware for one year after that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.269" end="00:29:45.649" style="s2">no real promises on that but we&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.429" end="00:29:46.909" style="s2">our best on the you know it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.649" end="00:29:48.679" style="s2">good platform there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.609" end="00:29:57.649" style="s2">which is another completely unused part</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.259" end="00:30:00.830" style="s2">of the chip in your D on the depth map</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.649" end="00:30:04.190" style="s2">using camera are working on that no no</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.830" end="00:30:05.899" style="s2">no no the commentaries nothing fun but</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.899" end="00:30:11.869" style="s2">to ship new hardware every year</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.099" end="00:30:14.629" style="s2">why no love to BMW because it uses flex</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.869" end="00:30:17.989" style="s2">write anything that uses Flex ray is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.629" end="00:30:19.789" style="s2">difficult no not a different smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.989" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">no I think I think that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.789" end="00:30:24.169" style="s2">be the last smartphone , product though</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:26.869" style="s2">the EON will be said</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.169" end="00:30:27.950" style="s2">ordered for quite a long time I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.869" end="00:30:30.019" style="s2">course there&#39;s gonna be an update you</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.450" end="00:30:36.769" style="s2">it&#39;s not right you need more hardware</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.190" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">than that obviously but I think by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.769" end="00:30:40.519" style="s2">end of the year and maybe with a demo</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:42.769" style="s2">that we have coming up in a few months</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.039" end="00:31:30.739" style="s2">have to figure out how to get more yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.059" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna develop our own hardware</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.739" end="00:31:33.499" style="s2">platform ah because I mean we have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.059" end="00:31:34.909" style="s2">EON is a hardware platform all right oh</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.600" end="00:31:47.690" style="s2">can you make self-driving bikes no that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.289" end="00:31:52.519" style="s2">means you want it to pedal you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.690" end="00:31:54.889" style="s2">electric bike you want to steer for you</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.989" end="00:32:10.820" style="s2">um Snapdragon Hardware no probably not</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.369" end="00:32:12.379" style="s2">you know who will use it do you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.820" end="00:32:13.549" style="s2">ways actually makes people more stressed</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.379" end="00:32:14.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t think so I think it makes it</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.930" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">Jeff Dean I don&#39;t think so uh neither</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.019" end="00:44:19.950" style="s2">publishing papers is kind of overrated</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:21.900" style="s2">what I consider common level three by</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.950" end="00:44:22.890" style="s2">December probably not I think level</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">three is more like a year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.890" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">away um to actually be level three I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.700" style="s2">think that we need I mean okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.380" end="00:44:31.349" style="s2">you get the kind of reliability you need</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:33.450" style="s2">for level three you&#39;re gonna need both a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.349" end="00:44:36.210" style="s2">really good ml model and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.450" end="00:44:38.190" style="s2">need maps and with those two combined I</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.210" end="00:44:39.720" style="s2">think you can get to level three does</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.190" end="00:44:40.440" style="s2">open pilot work well in Europe try it</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.720" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">yeah I think so</p>

<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.890" style="s2">right now I kind of work see today I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.609" end="00:44:50.670" style="s2">gonna left - I think Carmack is better</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.890" end="00:44:54.599" style="s2">than Dean maybe a cart Carmack Carmack&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.670" end="00:44:56.069" style="s2">a good programmer as well yeah he&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.599" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">know he wrote fine he&#39;s kind of doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.069" end="00:45:00.180" style="s2">small like stuff to us you know writing</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:03.569" style="s2">there I think if you are can yawn get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.180" end="00:45:06.089" style="s2">level three probably not maybe depending</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.569" end="00:45:08.190" style="s2">on the car lane change part of level</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.089" end="00:45:11.069" style="s2">three it doesn&#39;t have to be I&#39;m so level</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.069" end="00:45:14.309" style="s2">the best programmers guys I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.319" end="00:45:17.940" style="s2">a set of skills I think are very good</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.609" end="00:57:53.089" style="s2">it&#39;s better than open pilots some parts</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.230" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s worse it&#39;s a matter of taste</p>

<p begin="00:58:07.970" end="00:58:12.920" style="s2">kind of gracefully degrades supercruise</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:17.780" style="s2">is like you got a drive bro Google&#39;s</p>
