<p begin="00:00:03.230" end="00:00:10.260" style="s2">okay so I&#39;m gonna show you guys</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:12.830" style="s2">something well first first we&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">the website of what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.830" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">reproduce yes six microseconds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">protein folding so this is a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">villian headpiece protein I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">sure what it does maybe we should we</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">should look into that but look at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">so they have a simulator and they start</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">with the protein unfolded so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">even sure how you how you get a protein</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">unfolded we&#39;re gonna look into that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:51.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve been learning a lot of biology</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:51.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve been learning about amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.039" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading molecular biology of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.750" end="00:01:02.420" style="s2">the cell sixth edition it tells you many</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">good things you learn all about proteins</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.420" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">you learn about the different amino</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:13.100" style="s2">acids I know what a peptide bond is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:17.780" style="s2">right now I know what a sidechain is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.100" end="00:01:17.780" style="s2">yeah you got to know these things</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:24.869" style="s2">amino acids have an amino and it called</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">box&#39;ll so let&#39;s take a look here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.869" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">yeah you can see this is this is four</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">amino acids put together you start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">a met you know because that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">start codon and then you have these</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">peptide bonds which this is the amino</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">side and this is the carboxyl side see</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">that he fits in the side chains are</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">alternating from side to side but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">not really true you can actually rotate</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">this stuff however you want please turn</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.510" style="s2">up Mike you can turn the mic up let make</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:05.380" style="s2">sure we got the right Mike</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.510" end="00:02:05.380" style="s2">first of all here we got the first mic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">yeah you guys know I&#39;m part time to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:26.810" style="s2">I know I will take we&#39;ll take half a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">second to shelf or comma not to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.810" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">confused with this comment hey I this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">comment a I we are now a profitable</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:57.770" style="s2">profitability guys wow it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.820" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">good feeling yeah and I&#39;m done with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.770" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">I&#39;m done with my four years of testing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:11.570" style="s2">so it&#39;s pretty nice because I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:13.130" style="s2">exactly do you do right um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.570" end="00:03:17.600" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve been looking at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.130" end="00:03:20.300" style="s2">these startups doing layoffs and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.600" end="00:03:22.130" style="s2">know it&#39;s its last in first out so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:24.709" style="s2">people who got just recently got hired</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.130" end="00:03:26.870" style="s2">are the first ones to get fired but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.709" end="00:03:28.070" style="s2">know basically all you&#39;re left with at</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.870" end="00:03:31.190" style="s2">that point is you&#39;re gonna be left with</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.070" end="00:03:32.630" style="s2">executives and middle managers I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.190" end="00:03:33.800" style="s2">these companies are firing the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.630" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">who did the real work and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.800" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">gonna have well executives and middle</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">managers so we at common we do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:46.670" style="s2">differently I think both executives and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">middle managers is stupid everybody had</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.670" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">come as an engineer so yeah now come</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">about by oh we&#39;re gonna fall proteins</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">um startup employees are more risk than</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">the founder well if you have a founder</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">that takes less risk than your startup</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:12.329" style="s2">employees you&#39;re a start-up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">that&#39;s practically criminal you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.329" end="00:04:16.949" style="s2">see I see these startups I see these</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.609" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">founders who take VC money and they pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.949" end="00:04:20.099" style="s2">themselves $400,000 salaries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">disgusting it&#39;s really it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.099" end="00:04:29.639" style="s2">disgusting so I buy my celery , $78,000</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.810" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">cob and that&#39;s the highest that ever was</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.639" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">was 80 you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">you as a founder are taking less risk</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">than your startup employees there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">something seriously wrong with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">company yeah so know as a start-up</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:49.020" style="s2">employee</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:50.580" style="s2">you should definitely have have less</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.020" end="00:04:54.270" style="s2">risk than a founder you should be you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">should be paid a higher salary the so</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.270" end="00:04:58.349" style="s2">again a lot of startups can with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:05:01.500" style="s2">right so a lot of they&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.349" end="00:05:02.699" style="s2">restrictions on employee equity and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.500" end="00:05:05.250" style="s2">know a lot of times employees don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.699" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">really know about this so at comments</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.250" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">the other way around the restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">are on transfer of my equity not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">transfer of any employee equity</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.389" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">I&#39;m muted I don&#39;t think I&#39;m muted</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">so yeah if you&#39;re at a startup where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">founders are taking less risks and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">employees your your scammers</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:37.980" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re scammers a lot of the VCS</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:40.980" style="s2">are scammers to remember that VCS don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.980" end="00:05:42.630" style="s2">actually produce any value it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.980" end="00:05:46.170" style="s2">their money that they&#39;re investing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.630" end="00:05:48.390" style="s2">VCS just scam LPS the LPS a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.170" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">don&#39;t care like the Louisiana pension</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.390" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">fund you know get the Louisiana pension</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:55.290" style="s2">fund isn&#39;t being managed by the cops and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:57.090" style="s2">firefighters who will pay out the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.290" end="00:06:01.860" style="s2">Louisiana pension funds of course being</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">managed by corrupt politicians who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.860" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">sure line their pockets when the pension</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:08.910" style="s2">fund goes up and when the pension fund</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:12.840" style="s2">goes down oh hey hey you fought fires</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.910" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">and not in the suburbs for 30 years but</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.840" end="00:06:16.350" style="s2">now sorry they took your pension fund</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">and they invested it and we work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.350" end="00:06:23.340" style="s2">sorry um what would you ask founders</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.240" end="00:06:25.650" style="s2">what their take-home salary is I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.340" end="00:06:30.450" style="s2">founders should be paid the lowest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.650" end="00:06:33.980" style="s2">any employee of this job if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.450" end="00:06:36.150" style="s2">found a company and you&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.980" end="00:06:37.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re not looking for the upside</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.150" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">later on of course the upside to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.800" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">founders is they do get a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:43.800" style="s2">share of the equity of the company so</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">the upside on that and that size is much</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.800" end="00:06:46.950" style="s2">larger right but the risk is much larger</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">I you want higher upside take high risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.950" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">right what do we do when we do comm</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">niboshi ations</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:05.250" style="s2">headpiece protein I think I spelled it</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.860" end="00:18:06.809" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.250" end="00:18:11.070" style="s2">yeah villain I let&#39;s look up what</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.809" end="00:18:14.750" style="s2">villainous we have some some context the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.070" end="00:18:17.970" style="s2">tissue-specific actin binding protein</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.750" end="00:18:20.910" style="s2">associated with the actin core bundle of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.970" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">the brush border this is gonna be a big</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.129" end="00:19:16.750" style="s2">made up of seven domains Wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.020" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">supervillain okay well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:38.490" style="s2">they&#39;ll it is so I&#39;ve already got it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:40.110" style="s2">here I downloaded the protein PDB and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.490" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">actually committed it last night in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.110" end="00:19:47.430" style="s2">preparation for this stream so we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:50.730" style="s2">get the visualizer up here load up the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.430" end="00:19:51.810" style="s2">party so this is what it looks like but</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.730" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">this is what it looks like already</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.810" end="00:19:56.850" style="s2">folded when you download it from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:19:59.670" style="s2">protein database it already comes folded</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.850" end="00:20:00.780" style="s2">so if we don&#39;t want it fold it what</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.670" end="00:20:04.920" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to do is we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.780" end="00:20:06.360" style="s2">gonna get the well actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.920" end="00:20:09.560" style="s2">what let&#39;s just use our translator and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.360" end="00:20:09.560" style="s2">let&#39;s get it from DNA</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.190" end="00:20:32.820" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:38.210" style="s2">or genomic coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.380" end="00:20:58.360" style="s2">so I did find that if I go in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.789" end="00:21:01.460" style="s2">proteins villain and then I load it up</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.360" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">we can get the amino acids right here so</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.460" end="00:21:08.780" style="s2">I could just use them from this mat</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:10.250" style="s2">loser-ass blue asked fee ideally no what</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.780" end="00:21:12.049" style="s2">we want to do is we want to build a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.250" end="00:21:16.039" style="s2">framework so we&#39;ve already done remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.049" end="00:21:19.160" style="s2">um translation on SR transcription turns</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.039" end="00:21:20.630" style="s2">RNA into proteins but it doesn&#39;t turn it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.160" end="00:21:22.700" style="s2">into proteins it just turns it into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.630" end="00:21:24.650" style="s2">strand of amino acids in order to turn</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.700" end="00:21:28.370" style="s2">those amino acids into proteins we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.650" end="00:21:30.970" style="s2">gonna have to fold them that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.370" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">look useful and in order to fold them</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.970" end="00:21:40.280" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need a well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">you know a hard problem but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.280" end="00:21:44.770" style="s2">can do it with a molecular dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:50.980" style="s2">simulator oh here we go here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.770" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">it&#39;s too long okay we&#39;ll just use this</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.980" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">you just copied it here wait there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">Mets in here how can you have two Mets</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:02.900" style="s2">though you can have more start codons as</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:05.620" style="s2">long as you don&#39;t a stop codon oh I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.900" end="00:22:05.620" style="s2">I get it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:41.860" style="s2">that&#39;s Google this and see what we got</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.230" end="00:24:33.269" style="s2">Oh faster sequence Oh I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.019" end="00:24:42.359" style="s2">what I want okay I&#39;ll take it stick it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.269" end="00:24:45.149" style="s2">in the feeling directory other faster</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.359" end="00:25:02.759" style="s2">sequences and did I stick txt at the end</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.149" end="00:25:04.619" style="s2">of it okay so this is actually already</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.759" end="00:25:07.759" style="s2">after it&#39;s been translated into amino</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.619" end="00:25:14.389" style="s2">acids and they use the letters as</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.759" end="00:25:14.389" style="s2">desired this</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.980" end="00:26:58.460" style="s2">today oh yeah look at this great is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">36 this is 36 amino acid protein okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.460" end="00:27:03.320" style="s2">this and this are the same thing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.490" end="00:27:04.940" style="s2">only difference is this one is already</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.320" end="00:27:10.370" style="s2">folded so I mean we can probably check</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.940" end="00:27:11.420" style="s2">that mat blue sir no whatever D is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.370" end="00:27:15.650" style="s2">gonna be next</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.899" end="00:27:55.729" style="s2">oh that&#39;s funny okay so now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.019" end="00:27:58.849" style="s2">have to write something which turns</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.739" end="00:28:13.239" style="s2">for me oh no I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.740" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">way to go boys got a long way to go all</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.920" end="00:35:26.150" style="s2">right let&#39;s figure out what this P DV</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:32.900" style="s2">format is first let&#39;s look at a mat</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.150" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">where&#39;s the mat mat Sione&#39;s so we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.900" end="00:35:46.330" style="s2">an N I don&#39;t know if we have those H&#39;s 1</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:49.790" style="s2">2 3 4 5 5 carbons</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.330" end="00:35:53.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a carven two three four five</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.790" end="00:35:59.270" style="s2">carbons okay that seems right we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">one oxygen you have one sulfur oh we</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.270" end="00:36:05.540" style="s2">only have one oxygen do we have two</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:09.670" style="s2">oxygens oh we only have one oxygen okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:09.670" style="s2">well my methionine needs more oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.160" end="00:36:32.120" style="s2">there&#39;d be given an oxd that fixes it</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.330" end="00:36:33.710" style="s2">let&#39;s see what this looks like oh who</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.120" end="00:36:35.030" style="s2">put that oxygen all the way out there</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.710" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">that was a stupid place to put the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.030" end="00:36:45.830" style="s2">oxygen no template found for residue one</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:37:28.280" style="s2">met it means your input topology okay so</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.830" end="00:37:32.180" style="s2">we can look at the amber 99 we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.280" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">amber 99 SP now we want to make Metz not</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.180" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">a seam at just a met</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.230" end="00:37:48.930" style="s2">oh this is interesting okay I&#39;ll get rid</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.800" end="00:37:51.089" style="s2">of that just I think that was wrong the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.930" end="00:37:57.089" style="s2">set of atoms matches nment</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.089" end="00:38:02.070" style="s2">but the bonds are different oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.089" end="00:38:09.900" style="s2">an external bond I see that&#39;s an end of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.070" end="00:38:12.570" style="s2">it it has an external body I&#39;m 17 Arcee</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.900" end="00:38:17.460" style="s2">meds and Mets be like does it mean like</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.570" end="00:38:20.060" style="s2">a starting net and how come that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.460" end="00:38:20.060" style="s2">seam at</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.060" end="00:38:27.470" style="s2">oh I kind of think you can&#39;t have okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.580" end="00:38:32.150" style="s2">fine fine fine I&#39;ll have a met Anna Lou</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.470" end="00:38:34.280" style="s2">I think this you can&#39;t just sit</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.150" end="00:38:35.930" style="s2">complains if you have a one amino acid I</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.280" end="00:38:38.540" style="s2">think the starting ones are special so</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.930" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">oh look we have a met Anna Lou now</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.540" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a fancy looking protein what do</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">you think of my two amino acid protein</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.500" end="00:38:48.950" style="s2">atoms match Lou but the bonds are</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.450" end="00:38:52.610" style="s2">different perhaps the chain is missing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:55.340" style="s2">terminal okay so that seems wrong eat</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.610" end="00:39:04.610" style="s2">well wait there&#39;s C and there&#39;s n oh I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:39:06.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually a thing see what</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.610" end="00:39:10.910" style="s2">am I thinking off there&#39;s the 5 end and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.200" end="00:39:14.270" style="s2">the 3 end I know that C looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.910" end="00:39:17.120" style="s2">end because it has an oxd let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.270" end="00:39:19.340" style="s2">take a look in my bio textbook here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.120" end="00:39:23.330" style="s2">that Theo knees don&#39;t have a oxd but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.340" end="00:39:27.320" style="s2">I put a oxd at the end of my uh my fingy</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.330" end="00:39:32.440" style="s2">that seems good all right so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.320" end="00:39:32.440" style="s2">my ox down I just stuck it there</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.490" end="00:39:41.730" style="s2">Oh should I stick it there as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.910" end="00:39:52.530" style="s2">stick it above the hydrogen&#39;s I also</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.730" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">need a cz is that only at the end put it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.530" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">on Istanbul ooh let&#39;s see if that fixes</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:57.510" style="s2">yeah of course my ox is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:58.860" style="s2">stupid place look at that oxygen all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.510" end="00:39:59.670" style="s2">way out there that&#39;s so far away from</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.860" end="00:40:10.500" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.670" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">oh yeah body right now let&#39;s try it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.500" end="00:40:16.250" style="s2">let&#39;s run the simulation for a few steps</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:19.080" style="s2">and what we&#39;re gonna see is does the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.250" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">just that oxygen like stay far away or</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.080" end="00:40:30.150" style="s2">does it come back okay wow I really got</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">that lunge Abbi and integrate or turned</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.150" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">up let&#39;s turn it down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.330" end="00:40:42.080" style="s2">potential energy lots of kids Ulis</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.080" end="00:40:42.080" style="s2">alright</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.640" end="00:40:54.330" style="s2">whoa hey look the oxygen came back</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.820" end="00:40:55.740" style="s2">I wonder if minimize it oh no probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.330" end="00:40:58.710" style="s2">just didn&#39;t even save the first step</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.740" end="00:41:09.120" style="s2">let&#39;s save every step and let&#39;s just go</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.710" end="00:41:12.750" style="s2">for ten steps look the oxygen came back</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.120" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">was the oxd yeah look at that ox look it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.750" end="00:41:15.690" style="s2">came back wait that&#39;s a weird place to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">put it get both attached to that same</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.690" end="00:41:21.150" style="s2">carbon maybe on a loo here&#39;s a little oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:22.710" style="s2">yeah yeah they both go on the tarp</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.150" end="00:41:24.600" style="s2">carboxyl terminus Wow</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.710" end="00:41:26.220" style="s2">remember how I put it in a stupid place</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.600" end="00:41:27.960" style="s2">and then it showed up here oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.220" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">nice let&#39;s get rid of the minimize</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.960" end="00:41:34.100" style="s2">energy and see if that was always</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:37.050" style="s2">actually doing it oh look it crashed oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.100" end="00:41:44.010" style="s2">yeah that oxygen went flying but if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.050" end="00:41:46.440" style="s2">first minimize energy okay so let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.010" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">something else now and actually it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.440" end="00:41:50.970" style="s2">nice because I think we could just do</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:53.250" style="s2">this on the protein if this works but</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.970" end="00:41:57.210" style="s2">take my model of positions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.250" end="00:41:58.920" style="s2">like positions oh that&#39;s nice wow this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.210" end="00:42:02.370" style="s2">might be it this might be a short stream</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.920" end="00:42:08.280" style="s2">thank you for the subscriptions we</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.370" end="00:42:09.720" style="s2">overflowed honestly guys you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.280" end="00:42:12.060" style="s2">would do if I was on the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.720" end="00:42:13.620" style="s2">task force I wouldn&#39;t want to be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.060" end="00:42:17.580" style="s2">front face I wouldn&#39;t want to be the guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.620" end="00:42:19.980" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t want to be the guy telling</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.580" end="00:42:26.030" style="s2">people about the plant but you all know</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.980" end="00:42:26.030" style="s2">what the plan should be it&#39;s not great</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.390" end="00:42:36.549" style="s2">let&#39;s see model or depositions does</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.940" end="00:42:38.280" style="s2">shape list says no attribute shapes of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.549" end="00:42:40.630" style="s2">course must a little bunch of each shape</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.280" end="00:42:42.099" style="s2">land in the model are dot position so</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.630" end="00:42:49.869" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try putting them all at 0 0</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.099" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">0 let&#39;s see what happens say 4x and just</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.869" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.609" end="00:43:53.670" style="s2">particle coordinate is NaN well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.700" end="00:43:54.839" style="s2">sad don&#39;t make it man oh and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.670" end="00:43:55.979" style="s2">problem I&#39;d have to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.839" end="00:43:57.690" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t tell it my was</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.979" end="00:44:04.559" style="s2">nanometers but me doesn&#39;t matter I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.690" end="00:44:15.539" style="s2">know looks kind of similar to that whiny</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.559" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">value equals zero position no yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.539" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking particle coordinate is NaN</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.619" end="00:44:38.759" style="s2">okay if it just doesn&#39;t like them all</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.609" end="00:44:40.910" style="s2">being on top of each other random dot</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.759" end="00:44:40.910" style="s2">random</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.890" end="00:44:57.609" style="s2">oh sweet look at that it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:45:01.029" style="s2">protein II again yeah yeah let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.609" end="00:45:05.470" style="s2">they go to different confirmations haha</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.029" end="00:45:08.170" style="s2">so exciting so exciting this is so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.470" end="00:45:09.819" style="s2">exciting ok let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.170" end="00:45:11.109" style="s2">wait I want to don&#39;t wait to the save 20</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.819" end="00:45:12.450" style="s2">steps oh I did save 20 steps just</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.109" end="00:45:17.289" style="s2">nothing happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.450" end="00:45:18.670" style="s2">let&#39;s try a little bit more I wait for</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.289" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">it to warm up a little bit got to warm</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.670" end="00:45:27.309" style="s2">up my protein a little warming up a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">little bit more than that warm up my</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.309" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">protein got to make it nice and warm</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.109" end="00:45:46.329" style="s2">that&#39;s a quality looking protein alright</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.599" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">wait so let&#39;s just try it I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.329" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">unfolded thing is stupid I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:53.619" style="s2">actually need that let&#39;s just take the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:46:01.390" style="s2">protein PDB and then we&#39;ll do 0</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.619" end="00:46:05.069" style="s2">positions on it I don&#39;t see what ya know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.390" end="00:46:05.069" style="s2">it&#39;s nan-oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.489" end="00:46:14.099" style="s2">oh it&#39;s only now it&#39;s we&#39;re stepping</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.940" end="00:46:14.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not step so watch my step 20</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.999" end="00:46:30.950" style="s2">whoa it&#39;s my protein but it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.670" end="00:46:35.059" style="s2">unfolded like that no no I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.950" end="00:46:37.670" style="s2">looks pretty good look at that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.059" end="00:46:40.970" style="s2">randomly folded chicken head piece villa</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.670" end="00:46:43.279" style="s2">head piece or whatever whatever&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.970" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">right let&#39;s save a few more steps and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.279" end="00:46:47.180" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can do that without it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:52.779" style="s2">going down it goes man just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.180" end="00:46:55.819" style="s2">crapping machine learning models alright</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.779" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">let&#39;s see my protein falls folding</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">slowly I don&#39;t have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.180" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">patience fold faster</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.860" end="00:47:37.010" style="s2">chicken headpiece fall down oh look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.360" end="00:47:41.570" style="s2">that look at that potential energy going</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.010" end="00:47:45.770" style="s2">down that means my shits folding folding</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.570" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">folding folding oh no this is fun oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.770" end="00:47:54.380" style="s2">we&#39;re folding all right just to prove</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:56.710" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t cheat at all let me just</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.380" end="00:48:00.650" style="s2">write the thing that actually like</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.710" end="00:48:01.730" style="s2">creates that file you know that creates</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.650" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">that unfolded file</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.730" end="00:48:05.300" style="s2">there&#39;s otherwise like we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:08.420" style="s2">informations could be leaking but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.300" end="00:48:14.150" style="s2">want to turn amino acid sequences into</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.420" end="00:48:15.860" style="s2">proteins that we fault hey it&#39;s cupcake</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.150" end="00:48:19.510" style="s2">thank you for subscribing we got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.860" end="00:48:19.510" style="s2">of people in here y&#39;all like folding</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.500" end="00:48:28.700" style="s2">alright so I think we&#39;re pretty soon</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.570" end="00:48:33.080" style="s2">where we&#39;re gonna just need to throw a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.700" end="00:48:36.260" style="s2">lot of computation at this we might</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.080" end="00:48:41.780" style="s2">already be at that point hmm folding and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.260" end="00:48:46.270" style="s2">folding folding let&#39;s go 50 here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.780" end="00:48:46.270" style="s2">go 30 thousand let&#39;s see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.670" end="00:49:01.980" style="s2">oh this is a long thing for my folding</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.880" end="00:49:09.990" style="s2">go is my falling</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.980" end="00:49:12.119" style="s2">folding folding all right well we should</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.990" end="00:49:15.180" style="s2">figure out how long we expect to have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.119" end="00:49:16.829" style="s2">do this for before it falls I&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.180" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">it trying to fold all right really it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.829" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">wants to fall boys it wants to fold we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:28.470" style="s2">can open up the combo GPU cluster we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.470" end="00:49:42.109" style="s2">do that we have these options available</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.470" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">to us folding folding oh look at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.109" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">protein what&#39;s a beautiful protein I</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.950" end="00:49:53.160" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.569" end="00:49:54.750" style="s2">is it gonna start to form its alpha</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.160" end="00:50:05.670" style="s2">helix ease I learned about these by</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.750" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">reading a bio textbook mMmmm okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.670" end="00:50:08.789" style="s2">work out how many steps we should have</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:15.150" style="s2">to simulate it for so I&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.789" end="00:50:24.890" style="s2">this thing folds in 5 microseconds bill</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.150" end="00:50:28.549" style="s2">in a head piece folding and time 4 to 5</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.890" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">microseconds okay so let&#39;s say 5</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.549" end="00:50:43.400" style="s2">microseconds divided by that much Pico</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:43.400" style="s2">seconds what that&#39;s not what I want I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.730" end="00:50:50.759" style="s2">want you to give me a number and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.180" end="00:50:55.140" style="s2">stupid I cancelled out to set up and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.759" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">put the parentheses there we go okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.140" end="00:51:02.660" style="s2">what I mean we&#39;re all 5 we&#39;re off by a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:05.039" style="s2">couple you know orders of magnitude here</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.660" end="00:51:10.980" style="s2">that&#39;s how many steps we got to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.039" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of steps 250 how many more</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.980" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">steps is that than what we already did</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.960" end="00:51:26.220" style="s2">Wow proteins take a long time to fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.910" end="00:51:30.109" style="s2">boys we knew this though we knew this</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.220" end="00:51:30.109" style="s2">though and we should be prepared for it</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.289" end="00:52:08.839" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m folding on my GPU right now oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.459" end="00:52:08.839" style="s2">no it went man</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.540" end="00:52:49.490" style="s2">where is negative potential energy good</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.010" end="00:52:49.490" style="s2">Oh No</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.430" end="00:53:19.970" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.570" end="00:53:28.070" style="s2">alright I think it&#39;s too big in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.620" end="00:53:28.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.080" end="00:53:40.130" style="s2">too long this time the initialization is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.380" end="00:53:40.130" style="s2">totally different</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.920" end="00:53:59.089" style="s2">these are in a totally different range</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.480" end="00:54:03.930" style="s2">more negative means deeper in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">potential well is that what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.930" end="00:54:12.390" style="s2">be or where we don&#39;t want to be we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:18.359" style="s2">check in a minute what might folded</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.390" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">protein has oh yeah that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.359" end="00:54:27.930" style="s2">good okay it&#39;s not even connected look</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:29.730" style="s2">at that wow that&#39;s really shitty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.930" end="00:54:37.589" style="s2">the worst initialization I&#39;ve seen in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.730" end="00:54:58.560" style="s2">long time who broke my proteins alright</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.589" end="00:55:01.050" style="s2">let&#39;s try something we should also</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.560" end="00:55:03.270" style="s2">figure out if the amber SV is a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.050" end="00:55:07.260" style="s2">forcefield or not or if we should try a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.270" end="00:55:08.460" style="s2">different voice field first let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.260" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">what I what happens when I put my</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.460" end="00:55:17.670" style="s2">already folded protein oh wow that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:21.420" style="s2">lot of negative energy you know so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.670" end="00:55:25.400" style="s2">negative energies is good wiggle wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.420" end="00:55:25.400" style="s2">wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.090" end="00:55:38.210" style="s2">I also I scaled up my my thingy here cuz</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.320" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">I kind of think what happened does the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.210" end="00:55:44.450" style="s2">thing you got caught on itself well that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.700" end="00:55:46.120" style="s2">looks pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.450" end="00:55:48.110" style="s2">those are the right order of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.120" end="00:55:50.180" style="s2">when they have the ones that were like</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.110" end="00:55:54.920" style="s2">10,000 it was doing badly and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.180" end="00:55:57.350" style="s2">want to see this go down right folding</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.920" end="00:55:59.390" style="s2">folding oh look its folding so good look</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.350" end="00:56:08.450" style="s2">this used to be crappier and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.390" end="00:56:09.860" style="s2">folding better holding okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.450" end="00:56:12.860" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to fold it for that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.860" end="00:56:15.560" style="s2">many times more though which isn&#39;t great</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.860" end="00:56:18.890" style="s2">or maybe we can just do less picoseconds</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.560" end="00:56:20.690" style="s2">here how many picoseconds can I make my</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.890" end="00:56:29.350" style="s2">Langevin integrator and have it still</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">work hmmm look at it it&#39;s trying to fold</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.350" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to fold boys</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.930" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">max to femtoseconds oh no I&#39;m already at</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.500" end="00:56:54.789" style="s2">the Marik&#39;s got to throw second that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:57:07.549" style="s2">not many seconds at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.789" end="00:57:11.869" style="s2">damn electrodynamics is hard no I say</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.549" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">all right first thing before we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.869" end="00:57:24.650" style="s2">figure out how to make our foldings go</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">faster how long did that take</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:51.339" style="s2">what kind of Python time it right the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:51.339" style="s2">important time</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.270" end="00:57:59.820" style="s2">well this is folding we can break the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.150" end="00:58:01.530" style="s2">thingy to parse this well first off do I</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.820" end="00:58:05.580" style="s2">want to use amber or do I want to use</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.530" end="00:58:09.170" style="s2">some other one I have an idea some of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.580" end="00:58:09.170" style="s2">them are faster than others too</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.070" end="00:58:29.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not straightforward to say which</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.320" end="00:58:32.460" style="s2">one is best</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.400" end="00:58:34.020" style="s2">I hate when that&#39;s true I&#39;ll look at</p>

<p begin="00:58:34.020" end="00:58:50.340" style="s2">to be a good one I think it almost</p>

<p begin="02:25:22.300" end="02:25:31.420" style="s2">to do it oh my god okay I know what the</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.850" end="02:25:33.910" style="s2">bonds are actually if natural proteins</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.420" end="02:25:35.910" style="s2">fall from a straight chain then you</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.910" end="02:25:40.410" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be able to denature them</p>

<p begin="02:25:55.540" end="02:25:58.680" style="s2">make my protein flat</p>

<p begin="02:26:22.660" end="02:26:26.400" style="s2">crazy amounts is that gonna make it flat</p>

<p begin="02:27:48.971" end="02:27:54.101" style="s2">look at the force field we have a force</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.700" end="02:28:03.910" style="s2">field I know what that is now let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.101" end="02:28:06.370" style="s2">at the data the mass oh we can figure</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.910" end="02:28:09.790" style="s2">out why they have stupid names</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.370" end="02:28:14.080" style="s2">oh the atom tells me it&#39;s tight it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:29:37.970" end="02:29:45.640" style="s2">eight hundred degrees Kelvin which is a</p>

<p begin="02:29:45.640" end="02:29:57.860" style="s2">which isn&#39;t it just 373 I can&#39;t spell</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.860" end="02:30:01.220" style="s2">boiling boiling 273 let&#39;s try a more</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.860" end="02:30:04.729" style="s2">reasonable temperature of 373 can see if</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.220" end="02:30:06.050" style="s2">it still boils well let that fold all</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.729" end="02:30:07.760" style="s2">this one well look at how many steps</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.050" end="02:30:10.120" style="s2">it&#39;s done Wow so many steps and get</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.760" end="02:30:12.200" style="s2">folded yep you think I&#39;ve folded</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.120" end="02:30:15.100" style="s2">everything to my initial conditions are</p>

<p begin="02:30:57.490" end="02:31:03.650" style="s2">did this one unfold at the much more</p>

<p begin="02:31:18.220" end="02:31:22.120" style="s2">folds not a good way to solve this</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.810" end="02:31:23.189" style="s2">problem I know about alpha fold I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.120" end="02:31:25.689" style="s2">read the paper</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.189" end="02:31:28.420" style="s2">the problem with alpha fold is twofold</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.689" end="02:31:30.220" style="s2">one it&#39;s supervised learning they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.420" end="02:31:32.410" style="s2">just learning to predict the sequences</p>
<p begin="02:31:30.220" end="02:31:34.569" style="s2">based on the existing structure of</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.410" end="02:31:35.590" style="s2">protons which is all well and good if</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.569" end="02:31:37.540" style="s2">all you&#39;re trying to do is get a</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.590" end="02:31:39.250" style="s2">slightly new protein but the truth is</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.540" end="02:31:40.510" style="s2">any protein we can get the structure of</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.250" end="02:31:42.689" style="s2">we can already study with actually</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.510" end="02:31:45.100" style="s2">crystallography so it&#39;s not that useful</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.689" end="02:31:48.130" style="s2">problem number two with alpha fault is</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.100" end="02:31:50.590" style="s2">it still isn&#39;t that good while it does</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.130" end="02:31:52.479" style="s2">better than the other things at that</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.590" end="02:31:54.490" style="s2">competition the other things at that</p>
<p begin="02:31:52.479" end="02:31:56.500" style="s2">competition are written by noobs and</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.490" end="02:32:00.939" style="s2">they&#39;re basically just database searches</p>
<p begin="02:31:56.500" end="02:32:04.060" style="s2">and copy pasting machines do a tear of</p>

<p begin="02:32:04.060" end="02:32:10.090" style="s2">folding everything else this is top tier</p>
<p begin="02:32:07.870" end="02:32:12.910" style="s2">this is like in Pikachu and Smash</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.090" end="02:32:15.700" style="s2">Brothers 64 this is like the end being</p>

<p begin="02:32:15.700" end="02:32:20.850" style="s2">this is like being the ice climbers</p>

<p begin="02:32:29.801" end="02:32:34.261" style="s2">we need good in solution models</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.860" end="02:32:38.471" style="s2">crystallography is the solid-state</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.581" end="02:32:42.341" style="s2">Distortion yeah we need good in solution</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.471" end="02:32:43.931" style="s2">models I agree which is like this is in</p>
<p begin="02:32:42.341" end="02:32:46.841" style="s2">solution apparently apparently this</p>

<p begin="02:32:46.841" end="02:32:49.230" style="s2">what I heard</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.730" end="02:33:01.811" style="s2">okay we&#39;re boiling my protein it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.551" end="02:33:05.131" style="s2">of boiling it&#39;s not turning into a</p>
<p begin="02:33:01.811" end="02:33:05.131" style="s2">straight line I wanna say though</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.490" end="02:33:19.340" style="s2">okay but we can&#39;t just place the atoms</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.740" end="02:33:22.340" style="s2">randomly I understand are using</p>

<p begin="02:33:22.340" end="02:33:29.150" style="s2">read my code I&#39;m using the would change</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.890" end="02:33:31.370" style="s2">does the Lang even interpreter there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:33:29.150" end="02:33:34.430" style="s2">language interpreter a good one I also</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.370" end="02:33:38.750" style="s2">got rid of my non bonded method because</p>

<p begin="02:36:41.690" end="02:36:52.910" style="s2">oh it&#39;s not really absolute zero what a</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.080" end="02:36:59.120" style="s2">good molecular dynamics simulator you</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.910" end="02:37:00.980" style="s2">see you can&#39;t actually make stop no you</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.120" end="02:37:03.280" style="s2">guys you can&#39;t actually make stuff go to</p>

<p begin="02:37:03.280" end="02:37:08.990" style="s2">because if you had something that was</p>

<p begin="02:37:08.990" end="02:37:12.141" style="s2">would be upset because then you&#39;d know</p>

<p begin="02:41:33.479" end="02:41:42.270" style="s2">just need to just simulate it folding as</p>

<p begin="02:42:00.179" end="02:42:10.619" style="s2">designed for this oh yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:42:03.209" end="02:42:11.909" style="s2">what happens I mean we could probably</p>
<p begin="02:42:10.619" end="02:42:13.619" style="s2">straight now if we use like a</p>

<p begin="02:49:17.359" end="02:49:21.249" style="s2">where I really can that can happen</p>

<p begin="02:53:58.170" end="02:54:09.160" style="s2">because okay look the denatured one got</p>
<p begin="02:54:01.660" end="02:54:10.960" style="s2">negative got negative that oh this is</p>
<p begin="02:54:09.160" end="02:54:14.860" style="s2">getting similar okay I guess it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="02:54:10.960" end="02:54:19.150" style="s2">different wow the denatured one actually</p>
<p begin="02:54:14.860" end="02:54:21.780" style="s2">has lower energy okay maybe it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:54:19.150" end="02:54:24.431" style="s2">renature maybe I destroyed it</p>

<p begin="02:57:12.761" end="02:57:24.041" style="s2">get us more FPS guess all the FPS you</p>
<p begin="02:57:17.110" end="02:57:27.070" style="s2">want yeah well they that was every 50 so</p>
<p begin="02:57:24.041" end="02:57:31.391" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna just do right every that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:59:05.930" end="02:59:11.329" style="s2">does not look like it&#39;s gonna fold</p>

<p begin="02:59:23.260" end="02:59:28.989" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m gonna fold but psych</p>
<p begin="02:59:26.390" end="02:59:28.989" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="02:59:32.811" end="02:59:42.450" style="s2">wait how much space is this gonna take</p>
<p begin="02:59:35.460" end="02:59:46.580" style="s2">out well we&#39;re saving every 10</p>
<p begin="02:59:42.450" end="02:59:49.200" style="s2">picoseconds and we&#39;re folding for five</p>
<p begin="02:59:46.580" end="02:59:53.601" style="s2">milliseconds it&#39;s gonna be like</p>
<p begin="02:59:49.200" end="02:59:53.601" style="s2">gigabytes do I have that many gigabytes</p>
<p begin="02:59:55.970" end="03:00:00.740" style="s2">okay fine we&#39;ll put somewhere I have</p>
<p begin="02:59:57.960" end="03:00:00.740" style="s2">lots of Jigga bites</p>
<p begin="03:00:12.240" end="03:00:20.971" style="s2">I have 2.7 terabytes free on that hard</p>

<p begin="03:00:28.650" end="03:00:33.440" style="s2">look out look how unfolded that is</p>
<p begin="03:00:30.271" end="03:00:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just begging to fault</p>
<p begin="03:00:34.971" end="03:00:44.061" style="s2">okay so I think now we just have to wait</p>
<p begin="03:00:37.260" end="03:00:49.471" style="s2">because we use the right forest field I</p>
<p begin="03:00:44.061" end="03:00:52.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know should we maybe tomorrow</p>

<p begin="03:12:29.159" end="03:12:34.419" style="s2">in something that brings returns your</p>
<p begin="03:12:32.770" end="03:12:36.039" style="s2">money goes up like for example if your</p>
