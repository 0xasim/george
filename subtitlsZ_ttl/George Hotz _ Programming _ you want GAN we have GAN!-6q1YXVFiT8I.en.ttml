<p begin="00:00:06.779" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">is to transform uniform into Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.920" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">maybe we should try this in the ipython</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">notebook I think it might be ipython</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">open I think this might be too much yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work okay cool no ipython my</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">um we&#39;re using brave just fuck chrome</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.689" end="00:01:14.540" style="s2">you guys so it&#39;s on the front page of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:14.540" style="s2">hacker news right now it&#39;s a top story</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.710" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">Google just if you log into a Google</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">account on Chrome it now locks you idiot</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">now like logs the browser in and sends</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">your whole browsing history even when</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">you&#39;re not on the Google web site well</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:35.630" style="s2">okay they claim it doesn&#39;t send your</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">browsing history but I don&#39;t know man</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.630" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just Chrome is headed in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">direction Google as a company is headed</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">in the wrong direction this is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:47.579" style="s2">something we talk about commonly on</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">these streams so yeah fuck Google please</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">brave Python 3 we love Python 3 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:57.560" style="s2">we&#39;re using Python 3 this is plain old a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:57.560" style="s2">yes I don&#39;t any cool</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">default zoom level let&#39;s go down to 100</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.460" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">here you guys know what a big monitor ya</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:27.930" style="s2">know fuck curl man I&#39;m really sick a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">Google shit it just as a company also</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.930" end="00:02:37.780" style="s2">everybody would like to shed a tear for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:42.550" style="s2">Cody Wilson in jail in Texas let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.780" end="00:02:44.530" style="s2">shed a tear fuck the government that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.550" end="00:02:50.470" style="s2">right fuck the government alright cool</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:53.080" style="s2">now that we said it um let&#39;s move along</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.470" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">to try to do a Gantz</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.080" end="00:03:00.550" style="s2">let&#39;s try to do games so we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.780" style="s2">generators and discriminators so nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.550" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">likes make people that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.780" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">hold me you wrote good notes</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.110" style="s2">this is a good way to do auto reload</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.910" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">than they thought over thought it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.110" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">let&#39;s go so this is a challenge that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">given to me by somebody back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:04:07.099" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s see what these things little</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.450" end="00:04:13.879" style="s2">trick for a quick histogram you can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.099" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">sorted so you can see that&#39;s uniform so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.879" end="00:04:28.099" style="s2">let&#39;s put that comment at the top goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">is to transform uniform into n what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.099" end="00:04:36.919" style="s2">Gann ganas gamm this one I&#39;ll put the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">wikipedia guy over here you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.919" end="00:04:52.580" style="s2">read it ok so the first thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:53.300" style="s2">think we have to do oh I just realized</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.580" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.300" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">well I was tired that night that I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:05.780" style="s2">doing this ok so if we want to get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:08.180" style="s2">supervised set we can do this now we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.780" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">see if our net can learn the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.180" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">transformation without using the Gann so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">we can check if our generator works</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.750" end="00:05:35.160" style="s2">oh also cool thing what Kenneth what do</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.200" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">I have oh god I haven&#39;t knew enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.160" end="00:05:40.950" style="s2">tensor file you can now do from tensor</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:43.950" style="s2">flow cross and it&#39;s a built-in cross to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.950" end="00:05:46.980" style="s2">tensor flow it&#39;s nice it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.950" end="00:05:48.480" style="s2">much more stable so yes I know I scream</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.980" end="00:05:49.860" style="s2">about fuck Google but they do right</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.480" end="00:05:57.420" style="s2">tensor flow thank you for writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.860" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">counterflow Google oh cool so now we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.420" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">have tensor flow let&#39;s test the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">generator on its own first and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:28.860" style="s2">the generator can work so our goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.750" end="00:06:32.730" style="s2">transform X into y y&#39;all see look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.860" end="00:06:38.060" style="s2">coding guys yeah who&#39;s happy I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.730" end="00:06:38.060" style="s2">oh I know this isn&#39;t a nice soft</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.030" end="00:07:25.340" style="s2">that you are in one of those moods in I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.010" end="00:07:25.340" style="s2">am in one of them too and it&#39;s hard I</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">oh of course the GAD wasn&#39;t gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.300" end="00:07:59.760" style="s2">that if you can&#39;t even get it to work in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:08:07.320" style="s2">supervised learning mode you see how</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.760" end="00:08:09.860" style="s2">those distributions don&#39;t match see how</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">oh you think okay so what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.240" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">to do is learn a transformation from</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">uniform so from uniform so from X which</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.020" end="00:08:55.320" style="s2">yes figure this today we can make them</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:55.320" style="s2">small that cool from this into this</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.710" end="00:09:00.250" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna say at the top</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.670" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to transform uniform into</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.250" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">Gaussian but so far we haven&#39;t had much</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">luck at that even with look different AF</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">well I look different</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:25.520" style="s2">maybe it was learning no it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.580" end="00:09:25.520" style="s2">consecrate into Santa&#39;s garbage try Adam</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">oh oh it&#39;s starting to bend why does</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:10:05.110" style="s2">this need 17 million a pox try a sample</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:10.380" style="s2">count</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.110" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">oh yeah the plot does look different AF</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.380" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">let&#39;s try one nice number anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:40.960" style="s2">okay okay okay those may just learning</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:41.470" style="s2">something to learn anything no I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.960" end="00:10:46.230" style="s2">learn anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.470" end="00:10:46.230" style="s2">that&#39;s garbage Lu</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.480" style="s2">try bigger</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.279" end="00:11:06.550" style="s2">don&#39;t learn good bra no let&#39;s say this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:06.550" style="s2">is better no they don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:21.069" style="s2">okay this bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.560" end="00:11:23.959" style="s2">oh my money back this bullshit bigger Oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.069" end="00:11:34.639" style="s2">No learn so slowly because I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.959" end="00:11:36.920" style="s2">GPU they&#39;re closer it&#39;s almost learned</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.639" end="00:11:39.230" style="s2">literally the line that mimics the data</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.920" end="00:11:45.079" style="s2">this isn&#39;t even a game you guys this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.230" end="00:11:48.639" style="s2">supervised learning you know what when</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.079" end="00:11:52.189" style="s2">in doubt you need more deep sigh deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.639" end="00:11:55.249" style="s2">sit is deep learning after all deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.189" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean nothing I have to take</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.249" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">forever to learn huh</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a little lost girl that losses</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:13.250" style="s2">guys oh yeah look at finally matches</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:16.660" style="s2">yeah so I can&#39;t do tensorflow GPU</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.250" end="00:12:20.029" style="s2">because I won it because I have a Mac i</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.660" end="00:12:22.430" style="s2">bought a standalone GPU you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.029" end="00:12:23.569" style="s2">Nvidia driver on my computer but then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.430" end="00:12:26.209" style="s2">tried to you want to try to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.569" end="00:12:29.779" style="s2">tensorflow GPU do you guys want to waste</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.209" end="00:12:31.129" style="s2">an hour on that we could do that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.779" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">could waste time trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.129" end="00:12:37.129" style="s2">tensorflow GPU I wasted a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:40.579" style="s2">last time trying to do this about</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.129" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">match.com by the way a lot so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.579" end="00:12:44.809" style="s2">for the 14 bits you guys know that the</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.809" end="00:12:50.149" style="s2">because you give me money I&#39;m poor</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">tonight see I found a new thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.149" end="00:12:59.230" style="s2">like is called spindrift sparkling water</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:13:01.970" style="s2">and it&#39;s very expensive very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.230" end="00:13:03.740" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of a tragedy you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.970" end="00:13:05.300" style="s2">what&#39;s not expensive now you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.740" end="00:13:10.209" style="s2">was looking at today guys I was really</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.300" end="00:13:12.200" style="s2">excited about flights to Singapore I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.209" end="00:13:17.840" style="s2">could get a one-way</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.900" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">all right let&#39;s take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.560" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">weights this network they should learn</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.239" end="00:32:01.879" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t learn doesn&#39;t look like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.909" end="00:32:04.440" style="s2">that&#39;s no good</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.879" end="00:32:07.669" style="s2">cool let me know when I get the money</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.440" end="00:32:07.669" style="s2">we&#39;ll start singing</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.850" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">so maybe you can&#39;t which which is weird</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.749" end="00:33:51.149" style="s2">so wait this is kind of confusing what</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.309" end="00:33:53.869" style="s2">does this do oh just add some noise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.149" end="00:33:53.869" style="s2">just like adds noise</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.420" end="00:34:07.640" style="s2">my learns no good tell me more about my</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.560" end="00:34:07.640" style="s2">learn being no good</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.680" end="00:34:56.160" style="s2">perfect oh it is biases let&#39;s turn them</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.870" end="00:34:56.160" style="s2">off because those are complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.360" end="00:35:57.970" style="s2">okay let&#39;s see if we can get the law</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.190" end="00:35:57.970" style="s2">slower than this fast UD</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">I mean are you let&#39;s talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.310" end="00:36:07.790" style="s2">like analytically like is there any way</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:12.859" style="s2">that that&#39;s ever gonna fit that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.790" end="00:36:16.970" style="s2">distribution or is that or is a line</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.859" end="00:36:18.950" style="s2">really the best we can do and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.970" end="00:36:22.010" style="s2">putting through a non-linearity but</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.950" end="00:36:30.500" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the wrong non-linearity cuz</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.010" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">I&#39;m crazy like 10h well exactly bias</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.500" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.020" end="00:36:52.830" style="s2">we got fixes it would buy us thank you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:55.460" style="s2">for the money dork while you are bro</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.830" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">love with people give me money on twitch</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:37:00.630" style="s2">after Alexa gives me my $10 I&#39;ll sing a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:02.790" style="s2">song and then if anyone wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.630" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">singing the other songs if I&#39;m in a song</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.790" end="00:37:10.230" style="s2">singing mood will sing songs for just $1</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:31.560" style="s2">maybe only from in a song singing mood</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:44.070" style="s2">oh no bro money you love money shot big</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.560" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">batch lower than that okay so maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.070" end="00:37:53.270" style="s2">need a middle layer I&#39;d guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.270" style="s2">that net can fit this</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.280" end="00:38:13.730" style="s2">trophies discount</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:42.730" style="s2">this only line it&#39;s only line not line</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.750" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">still lied not only kept my flaw fucking</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">not plain Wow Jay Z line okay maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">need bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.550" end="00:39:25.010" style="s2">my grave my bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.860" end="00:39:37.510" style="s2">this isn&#39;t learning I can&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.620" end="00:39:40.740" style="s2">I need like a three-layer network to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.510" end="00:39:40.740" style="s2">approximate a Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.720" end="00:39:50.950" style="s2">still not learning</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.299" end="00:40:09.669" style="s2">no we learned took a bit but it lurked</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.779" end="00:40:13.089" style="s2">see now look how the loss is lower than</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.669" end="00:40:19.209" style="s2">the line now like now it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.089" end="00:40:25.059" style="s2">curve why is this so hard to learn okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.209" end="00:40:28.469" style="s2">now to learn it what&#39;s the simplest net</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.059" end="00:40:28.469" style="s2">I can get to learn this distribution</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.639" end="00:40:40.209" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty decent or something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.589" end="00:40:41.769" style="s2">well most four layer Network even see if</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.209" end="00:40:44.339" style="s2">we can learn it without the bias it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.769" end="00:40:44.339" style="s2">start there</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.010" end="00:41:07.900" style="s2">okay it learns here too</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.750" end="00:41:22.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need the biases to learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:39.260" style="s2">sorry this is AG and we lied again okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.369" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">somehow they did it here with like a one</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.260" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">layer Network</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.910" end="00:42:12.170" style="s2">look at that beauty</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.950" end="00:42:40.520" style="s2">kind of curiosity what if I go the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.390" end="00:42:40.520" style="s2">way huh that seems easier to learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.500" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just the loss isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">just hi out see if it gets rid of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">if I keep going</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.570" end="00:43:14.140" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.740" end="00:43:26.970" style="s2">okay learns that pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.470" end="00:43:53.290" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a Gaussian with you mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:54.090" style="s2">for standard deviation 0.5 now that that</p>
