<p begin="00:27:48.919" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2">cameras yeah that&#39;s another oh we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.100" end="00:28:02.029" style="s2">like we really need a hammer so religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:07.299" style="s2">is disengagement tracking system so when</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.029" end="00:28:07.299" style="s2">we do feel limited by our single camera</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.389" end="00:28:12.899" style="s2">scenarios where this is the physical or</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.119" end="00:28:12.899" style="s2">another camera</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.750" end="00:28:21.220" style="s2">we are very deliberate motivations for</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.260" end="00:28:23.350" style="s2">partner system yeah Harbor cross some</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.220" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">money hardware has recurring expense</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.350" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">software only has not requiring expense</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:30.190" style="s2">to always want to do something you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">if you can in software that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.190" end="00:28:33.790" style="s2">featuring obviously this bog Joe is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">nothing sir Buxton hardware but you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.790" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">don&#39;t know workaround Hardware bugs some</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:39.070" style="s2">software but if you can replace more or</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.780" end="00:28:40.450" style="s2">more expensive hardware with software</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.070" end="00:28:41.710" style="s2">you should always do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.450" end="00:28:45.220" style="s2">this is why cameras are gonna be lighter</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.710" end="00:28:47.800" style="s2">but I mean I&#39;ve talked to Ricardo right</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.220" end="00:28:50.260" style="s2">now I think that this open pilot is</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.800" end="00:28:51.910" style="s2">ready to release to the public so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.260" end="00:28:55.170" style="s2">going to push it probably tonight to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.910" end="00:28:57.250" style="s2">devel you guys can start checking out</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.170" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">0.4 with all of its goodness</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.250" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">a little bit of retuning we&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:07.180" style="s2">as we go this things i complain about so</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.660" end="00:29:08.950" style="s2">by the time you buy stuff right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.180" end="00:29:12.260" style="s2">you&#39;ll have the hardware ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.950" end="00:29:15.049" style="s2">when the software launches</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.260" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">how exciting they got the phone how many</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.049" end="00:29:21.410" style="s2">spell bees 4828 over losing people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:23.660" style="s2">we drop this up this was ago might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.410" end="00:29:26.200" style="s2">because we have bad signal I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.660" end="00:29:26.200" style="s2">advancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.730" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">that&#39;s fine ship it out man</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.880" end="00:29:52.510" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.180" end="00:30:02.660" style="s2">we found a bug the waves crashing</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.800" end="00:30:05.620" style="s2">the bug is fixed we just have to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.660" end="00:30:05.620" style="s2">about how to actually ship</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:12.230" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t think so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:14.750" style="s2">why I think we ship without it that bug</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.230" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">would be fixed to like actually soon not</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.750" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">even sweetie</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:30.490" style="s2">I think we might have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">improvements of sugar plus as well we</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.490" end="00:30:36.340" style="s2">head above these interface places</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">crashing I&#39;m not sure exactly as the bug</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.340" end="00:30:40.390" style="s2">was but uh it&#39;s fixed now it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:41.810" style="s2">tight</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.390" end="00:30:43.400" style="s2">yeah</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.570" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">driving without a baby what we should do</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.810" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">is we should increase them to time out</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:06.170" style="s2">there now the issue is we want to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:08.270" style="s2">people time to get out of there ya know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.170" end="00:31:10.100" style="s2">it&#39;s important so we disengage the</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.770" end="00:33:23.890" style="s2">like the one last night nothing nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.750" end="00:33:28.400" style="s2">yeah panda needs to be out of safety</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.179" end="00:33:30.980" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.400" end="00:33:32.570" style="s2">that&#39;s correct impatient no not out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.980" end="00:33:36.650" style="s2">safety what so pandas have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.570" end="00:33:38.270" style="s2">safety the default safety mode is the</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.270" end="00:33:43.040" style="s2">and this is the mode used by Schaefer</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:45.230" style="s2">PLAs and shiver shiver can now switch in</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.040" end="00:33:48.500" style="s2">a dual mode which only allows things to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.230" end="00:33:50.120" style="s2">be sent then there is an all-access</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.500" end="00:33:52.610" style="s2">safety mode which Oakland pilot never</p>
