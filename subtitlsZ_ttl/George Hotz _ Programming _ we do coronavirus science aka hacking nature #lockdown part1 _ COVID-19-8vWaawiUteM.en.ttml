<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">data science we&#39;re not doing data</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">science don&#39;t worry no you don&#39;t have to</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.139" end="00:04:56.910" style="s2">download the genome with a coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:10.659" style="s2">we can zoom in a little bit - yeah Jen</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.050" end="00:05:15.590" style="s2">bag look at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.659" end="00:05:26.990" style="s2">all right so we can get oh it&#39;s a sign</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.590" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">of an API look at this see this this</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.990" end="00:05:41.210" style="s2">here is the coronavirus only or has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">the end of it is alright that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.210" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">efficient code the suit I&#39;m saying right</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">so I want to do I want to do a few bits</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">of data science on the coronavirus damn</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.690" end="00:06:13.819" style="s2">all right we got Corona all right how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">we do this I basically I only want the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.819" end="00:06:18.740" style="s2">a&#39;s t&#39;s c&#39;s and g&#39;s we could do it with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:28.279" style="s2">a filter we could do it with a darker</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.740" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">place okay corona equals corona the curl</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.279" end="00:06:33.349" style="s2">is too long to type we&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:33.979" style="s2">call it CC we don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.349" end="00:06:37.690" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.979" end="00:06:37.690" style="s2">see see see see</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.169" end="00:07:09.229" style="s2">faster way to replace okay so welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.659" end="00:07:11.749" style="s2">the corona virus genome this is from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.229" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">original sample in wuhan we might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.749" end="00:07:34.129" style="s2">looking into learn the basic terms all</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.960" end="00:07:36.830" style="s2">right so this is um what&#39;s the first one</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.129" end="00:07:38.539" style="s2">how many base pairs is it let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.830" end="00:07:39.860" style="s2">google this number and see if I got that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.539" end="00:07:46.629" style="s2">right what happened to new Google this</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.860" end="00:07:46.629" style="s2">number was a zip code base pairs oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.750" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">look at this everything the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">Internet&#39;s about this stuff now so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.129" style="s2">haven&#39;t taken a bio class in a long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">but we&#39;re gonna see what we can remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.129" end="00:08:01.159" style="s2">so first off here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.699" style="s2">question right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.159" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the cola magrav complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.699" end="00:08:09.800" style="s2">coronavirus how many bytes of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">information does it contain um can I use</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.800" end="00:08:15.469" style="s2">XZ from the Python XC as much well Wells</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">you may I have I was in LA what I will</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.469" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">do this later Z live.com press</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.740" end="00:08:28.210" style="s2">see no bites like object is required not</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:31.330" style="s2">strange oh why do I use Python why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.210" end="00:08:37.510" style="s2">we go back to Python to no attribute</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.330" end="00:08:39.820" style="s2">decode and oh yeah there we go okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.510" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">how many this is remember you can only</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.820" end="00:08:44.260" style="s2">upper bound column graph complexity you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">can&#39;t lower bound column graph</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.260" end="00:08:53.320" style="s2">complexity go to solo learner Kotick add</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:58.710" style="s2">what&#39;s is biopython a thing let&#39;s teach</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.320" end="00:08:58.710" style="s2">me so much whoa was any of this cool</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.950" end="00:09:09.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like the API for biopython all</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.310" end="00:09:16.420" style="s2">right so it&#39;s interesting that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.370" end="00:09:19.150" style="s2">upper bound the the the the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.420" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">at 8 kilobytes of information and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.150" end="00:09:24.730" style="s2">suspect it&#39;s even smaller than that so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:28.620" style="s2">for a reference the smallest computer</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.730" end="00:09:32.370" style="s2">virus I know about is sequel slammer</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.620" end="00:09:35.020" style="s2">let&#39;s see if I can find the packet oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">wow sequel slammer oh this is this was I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.020" end="00:09:40.780" style="s2">this was an efficient virus it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:45.190" style="s2">three hundred and seventy three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.780" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">and seventy six bytes it probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.190" end="00:09:54.670" style="s2">compresses even more 8k yeah how long</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:55.960" style="s2">have I been program if I&#39;m gonna zoom</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.670" end="00:10:02.280" style="s2">out a little bit here so I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.960" end="00:10:02.280" style="s2">see kind of like make the chat bigger I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.090" end="00:10:13.650" style="s2">can collapse the chat users and chat</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:16.330" style="s2">nature yeah yo y&#39;all we hack in nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.650" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">yo us we should name that we should</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.330" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">change the title we do coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:32.340" style="s2">science AKA hacking nature yeah cuz</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:32.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.930" end="00:10:41.070" style="s2">all right no I don&#39;t know let&#39;s uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.480" end="00:10:43.050" style="s2">see if we can compress a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.070" end="00:10:46.170" style="s2">I&#39;m sure the coronavirus isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.050" end="00:10:48.620" style="s2">this large oh no I made my mouse really</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.170" end="00:10:48.620" style="s2">sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:55.500" style="s2">no it&#39;s still insanely sensitive oh I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.580" end="00:10:56.580" style="s2">could press down on this okay now is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.500" end="00:11:02.730" style="s2">less sensitive cool</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.580" end="00:11:04.470" style="s2">do I have housing ma I have lzma and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.730" end="00:11:06.840" style="s2">just put another cell here so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.470" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">keep running into that so I probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.840" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t put the coronavirus on disk</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:18.110" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:20.120" style="s2">but by the way cost to synthesize base</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.110" end="00:11:23.430" style="s2">pairs</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:27.300" style="s2">just-just-just yeah yeah it&#39;s about ten</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.430" end="00:11:31.230" style="s2">cents so remember that you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.300" end="00:11:44.190" style="s2">yeah yeah so like that&#39;s well within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.230" end="00:11:47.840" style="s2">range of a hobbyist you know now it just</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.190" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">was just exploring man or just exploring</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.840" end="00:11:56.540" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna figure out like the strength</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:12:00.960" style="s2">of its reading frames and stuff um DNA</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.540" end="00:12:03.090" style="s2">synthesis service so like I wonder can</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.960" end="00:12:05.660" style="s2">you can you like what if you upload this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.090" end="00:12:05.660" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.550" end="00:12:18.050" style="s2">hmm no oh god you gotta go with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:23.990" style="s2">expensive service if you want something</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.050" end="00:12:27.230" style="s2">this long oh here we go</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.990" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">okay well you pay more if your price per</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.230" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">base pair is you guys do know you can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">this right I&#39;m not like like spreading</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.140" end="00:12:41.390" style="s2">like secret bioterrorist information am</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:42.500" style="s2">i I&#39;m just I&#39;m just I&#39;m just looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:47.690" style="s2">we&#39;re just doing science we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.500" end="00:12:49.459" style="s2">doing science not it was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.690" end="00:12:52.190" style="s2">things this is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.459" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">scares me you know it really wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.190" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">that hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.750" end="00:13:08.750" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.730" end="00:13:44.960" style="s2">lzma makes it even smaller we get it</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.790" end="00:13:48.570" style="s2">under 8k format XZ traffic&#39;s equals 9 or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.960" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">one-shot compression and used-up does</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.570" end="00:14:09.480" style="s2">this work this function take any</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">parameters so you see why I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.480" end="00:14:15.089" style="s2">in compressing right why do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.100" end="00:14:16.950" style="s2">know what the compressed size is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.089" end="00:14:20.390" style="s2">compress size so there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.950" end="00:14:20.390" style="s2">called Karma graph complexity</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:26.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s the short</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.220" end="00:14:30.380" style="s2">length of the shortest computer program</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.840" end="00:14:33.080" style="s2">that produces the object as output so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.380" end="00:14:36.050" style="s2">basically like how much information is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.080" end="00:14:37.730" style="s2">there in in the corona virus and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.050" end="00:14:46.370" style="s2">turns out there&#39;s about eight point four</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.730" end="00:14:48.890" style="s2">kilobytes the rumor is the corona is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.370" end="00:14:51.380" style="s2">HIV sequences inserted into another</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.890" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">virus we can check that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.380" end="00:14:59.180" style="s2">that&#39;s true it&#39;s the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:15:02.090" style="s2">entropy yeah yeah pretty much I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.180" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">called our flux is measured in what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.090" end="00:15:05.540" style="s2">the unit of entropy I guess it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:12.200" style="s2">same yeah I guess yeah it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.540" end="00:15:15.110" style="s2">same yeah it&#39;s a number of bits but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.200" end="00:15:20.060" style="s2">mean entropy the differences entropy</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.110" end="00:15:21.680" style="s2">usually refers to randomness all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.060" end="00:15:23.810" style="s2">all right all right I don&#39;t want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:26.840" style="s2">any conspiracy theories about you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.810" end="00:15:28.070" style="s2">China made it in a lab if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.840" end="00:15:30.620" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get to the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.070" end="00:15:32.570" style="s2">right now as you know any good hacker</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.620" end="00:15:33.470" style="s2">would definitely shut their handle in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.570" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">here somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.470" end="00:15:38.330" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look and see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.810" end="00:15:42.790" style="s2">find anybody&#39;s handle I show up in here</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.330" end="00:15:48.070" style="s2">okay so I don&#39;t know what biopython is</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.790" end="00:15:55.430" style="s2">but we&#39;re gonna just Google decoding DNA</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.070" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">into codons yeah so there&#39;s like a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.430" end="00:16:03.800" style="s2">here we go this this this this this so</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:06.710" style="s2">the pro Kang for those of you that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.800" end="00:16:13.700" style="s2">know well whether the basic bio here you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.710" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">can decode DNA using this and these are</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.700" end="00:16:17.870" style="s2">the different codons and they break down</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2">into basically these I believe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.870" end="00:16:26.090" style="s2">amino acids is that right yes in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.980" end="00:16:28.400" style="s2">transcription the DNA sequence is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.090" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">rewritten in RNA so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.400" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">transcription cuz this is a virus and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:33.860" style="s2">it&#39;s RNA don&#39;t okay if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:35.930" style="s2">but any of this stuff yell at me y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.860" end="00:16:38.090" style="s2">probably know more bio than me but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.930" end="00:16:40.130" style="s2">think the virus is RNA only so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.090" end="00:16:42.920" style="s2">just gonna do translation we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.130" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">write some code to do translation so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.920" end="00:17:02.660" style="s2">we&#39;ll say like def translation now we</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">need to put in these codes a TCG what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.660" end="00:17:13.189" style="s2">up with the use why are there use oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a you because it&#39;s RNA I think but</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.189" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a scam then why do they tell me</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:30.890" style="s2">the the that this is a ste season geez</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">what&#39;s this is RNA though right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.890" end="00:17:37.100" style="s2">know I think that&#39;s what the difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:38.360" style="s2">is all right yeah dude the U is an RNA</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.100" end="00:17:43.400" style="s2">yeah so but we I think we can just</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.360" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">replace it with the t&#39;s right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.400" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">make a dictionary uuu equals oh no okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the amino I let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:05.470" style="s2">look up amino acids right we&#39;ll learn in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">here so I think there&#39;s like 20 of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.470" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">not 21 of the 21 amino acids there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">nine that humans can&#39;t synthesize and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.710" style="s2">then you can stick these all together</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:23.050" style="s2">into proteins all right here we go wow</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:23.050" style="s2">this is nice 21 amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.770" end="00:18:31.450" style="s2">good they all have letters oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">that&#39;s convenient I&#39;ve seen this before</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.450" end="00:18:37.660" style="s2">and then we could we can check we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.920" end="00:18:39.610" style="s2">check our results with diamonds who</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.660" end="00:18:43.060" style="s2">plays with your cylinder I see someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.610" end="00:18:44.770" style="s2">studied in bio wasn&#39;t me man all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.060" end="00:18:46.120" style="s2">so we have all these letters we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.770" end="00:18:49.180" style="s2">need to figure out which letters</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.120" end="00:18:51.880" style="s2">correspond to which DNA sequences yo how</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.180" end="00:18:54.180" style="s2">sick is it that you can decode nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.880" end="00:18:56.920" style="s2">like this this isn&#39;t even that hard man</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.180" end="00:18:58.360" style="s2">this isn&#39;t even that hard then ok so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.920" end="00:18:59.680" style="s2">then first we&#39;re gonna do the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.360" end="00:19:01.390" style="s2">translation and that way to get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.680" end="00:19:05.230" style="s2">amino acids then we&#39;re gonna try to fold</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.390" end="00:19:08.350" style="s2">the protein I took organic chemistry in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:09.820" style="s2">uh in college really just as I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.350" end="00:19:12.550" style="s2">learn to make drugs I&#39;m not gonna lie I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.820" end="00:19:19.900" style="s2">wanted to learn to make drugs then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.550" end="00:19:21.400" style="s2">don&#39;t learn that because they tell you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.900" end="00:19:22.810" style="s2">how to make drugs I mean they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.400" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">like do you get to play with anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.810" end="00:19:26.680" style="s2">you know when you read like these like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:27.910" style="s2">recipes and like like you know Arrowwood</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.680" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">and stuff you want to know how to follow</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.910" end="00:19:32.830" style="s2">them and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know then just</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:34.510" style="s2">do a simple acid-base extraction what</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.830" end="00:19:37.300" style="s2">the hell is an acid-base extraction</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.510" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2">right you wanted to make aspirin in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.300" end="00:19:40.270" style="s2">first year or go wait Aspen&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:50.020" style="s2">really complicated isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.270" end="00:19:56.200" style="s2">oh no nevermind it&#39;s dead simple laughs</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.020" end="00:20:00.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t host them simple it was cocaine</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.769" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">okay cool okay let&#39;s just parse that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.200" end="00:22:59.389" style="s2">table out no just the table we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:08.690" style="s2">this TT and I love naming my variables</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.389" end="00:23:15.279" style="s2">right what is this is a tab tap teach</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.690" end="00:23:18.110" style="s2">you got split tab is o X that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.279" end="00:23:24.580" style="s2">that&#39;s a first we&#39;ll say for T and T G</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.110" end="00:23:24.580" style="s2">dot split new line you got split line</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">what told you to split based on new luck</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.200" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">Oh oops there we go okay this looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:51.850" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna separate this into kV</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.220" end="00:24:18.830" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna say if slash in a K got</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.250" end="00:24:24.760" style="s2">split / so - one dots okay cool - many</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.830" end="00:24:28.280" style="s2">values to unpack expected to above H</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.760" end="00:24:30.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t V have it - oh this kept a gun</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.280" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">in there yeah y&#39;all ready done</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.410" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">good yeah gun control yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.150" end="00:24:47.000" style="s2">now the stick and hope we get more of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.560" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">this no no no no guys guys there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.000" end="00:24:52.190" style="s2">plan yet you know if you&#39;re new in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:54.290" style="s2">stream you think that we do stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.190" end="00:24:56.030" style="s2">this strand if you&#39;re old to my stream</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:24:57.740" style="s2">you know that we actually just shit talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.030" end="00:24:59.660" style="s2">and do nothing all right</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.740" end="00:25:02.980" style="s2">but while actually doing stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.660" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">weird but it takes a bit to get used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.980" end="00:25:11.270" style="s2">okay let&#39;s just say be equal to be dobry</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:14.090" style="s2">cool ladies we&#39;re writing our own DNA</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.270" end="00:25:16.550" style="s2">decoder you know yeah you ever written a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.090" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">decoder for like x86 assembly it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.550" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">that but for DNA man all right sweet so</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">these things decode to those days</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.810" end="00:25:33.650" style="s2">now let&#39;s see do they usually just start</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.700" end="00:25:38.110" style="s2">and stop a kind of stupid they not have</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.650" end="00:25:43.130" style="s2">better names for these we&#39;ll look at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.110" end="00:25:45.470" style="s2">translation yeah okay we&#39;re gonna figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.130" end="00:25:48.980" style="s2">out where the proteins are we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.470" end="00:25:51.110" style="s2">break it all down can I get more</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.980" end="00:25:52.280" style="s2">anti-state ramps nah we love this day</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.110" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">we&#39;re all good citizens of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.280" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">government right now and when they come</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">with the m16</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:21.800" style="s2">all right I think actually before we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:29.730" style="s2">that we&#39;re just gonna say dot lower dot</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.800" end="00:26:32.630" style="s2">replace you with T because we&#39;re some</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.730" end="00:26:42.210" style="s2">reason DNA okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.630" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">or V V and V dad equals that decks of V</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:55.110" style="s2">V equals K okay now we have our stuffed</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:27:03.059" style="s2">decode DNA with what did they can start</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.110" end="00:27:04.590" style="s2">and stop letters you know the fridge is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.059" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">empty but you check anyway no I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.590" end="00:27:08.370" style="s2">thinking about ice cream but I realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.090" end="00:27:10.679" style="s2">never need a lot ice cream today this</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.370" end="00:27:12.809" style="s2">pickings are slim at the store you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.679" end="00:27:15.990" style="s2">how we used to eat pasta that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.809" end="00:27:17.580" style="s2">luxury no longer affordable to us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.990" end="00:27:20.040" style="s2">man how much of computers is just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.580" end="00:27:26.309" style="s2">parsing crap okay let&#39;s parse the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.040" end="00:27:38.040" style="s2">coronavirus for i in range one Wayne CC</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.309" end="00:27:43.559" style="s2">three decks of CC so I plus three Kiera</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.040" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">AAA well we got to the end we made it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.559" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">all the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.399" end="00:27:56.209" style="s2">all right sweetie that means they all</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.019" end="00:27:59.839" style="s2">decoded I don&#39;t know maybe they always</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.209" end="00:28:03.009" style="s2">all decode I will just call this a a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.839" end="00:28:13.429" style="s2">because it&#39;s an amino acid chain AAA</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.009" end="00:28:17.059" style="s2">append Dec all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.429" end="00:28:19.519" style="s2">well so now you&#39;re gonna get into stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.059" end="00:28:22.700" style="s2">called reading frames now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.519" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">actually three reading frames does</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.700" end="00:28:27.469" style="s2">everyone know that so reading frame who</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:29.539" style="s2">knows why cuz it&#39;s three right who gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.469" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">it yeah yeah you get it right cool let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.539" end="00:28:37.399" style="s2">go so this is all the proteins that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:38.539" style="s2">virus can possibly Express let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.399" end="00:28:42.979" style="s2">throw up</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.539" end="00:28:45.529" style="s2">join AAA in there and let&#39;s see if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.979" end="00:28:48.529" style="s2">did the decoding right okay so now when</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.529" end="00:28:50.329" style="s2">I look for the translation of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.529" end="00:29:01.239" style="s2">not in my shit and I probably did it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.329" end="00:29:01.239" style="s2">wrong these are mess there&#39;s no mess no</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.919" end="00:29:15.559" style="s2">net glue oh there&#39;s no app I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.239" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">Sarah it&#39;s an S I don&#39;t know we decoded</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.559" end="00:29:28.700" style="s2">all turned reading frames met/met is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:30.289" style="s2">start codon no it&#39;s not no no let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.700" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">just like one of these sequences let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.289" end="00:29:40.489" style="s2">see if I can find it hmm you guys what</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:42.739" style="s2">if we uncover some crazy shit right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.489" end="00:29:47.239" style="s2">what if we uncover that they&#39;re lying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.739" end="00:29:52.579" style="s2">us about the translation net is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.239" end="00:29:56.419" style="s2">start codon oh man is the start codon oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.579" end="00:29:59.130" style="s2">shit you&#39;re right you&#39;re right all you</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.580" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">where&#39;s the stop codon something else as</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.770" end="00:30:13.500" style="s2">well so that&#39;s such a scam because met</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:14.490" style="s2">is both here ended start oh we didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.490" end="00:30:29.850" style="s2">oh if V V in Dec print do V V</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.450" end="00:30:31.370" style="s2">oh there&#39;s duplicate song wait no this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.850" end="00:30:34.770" style="s2">sucks</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.370" end="00:30:38.490" style="s2">if I have an AAU how do I know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.770" end="00:30:45.870" style="s2">getting an as in or an ASP me just sucks</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.490" end="00:30:48.030" style="s2">man why would they do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.870" end="00:30:50.390" style="s2">this is the shittiest encoding I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.030" end="00:30:50.390" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.990" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">nature is troll gay alright wait wait</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.600" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">glue can go why would they do this they</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.000" end="00:31:27.030" style="s2">have Glenn glue and then Glenn or glue</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:29.670" style="s2">well never using that one the start</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.030" end="00:31:42.450" style="s2">codon is stupid too because it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.670" end="00:31:46.890" style="s2">mat now oh yeah oh yeah decoding let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.450" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">see if there are any more dupes why okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.890" end="00:31:55.920" style="s2">there&#39;s actually lots of tubes right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:58.020" style="s2">but that&#39;s just cause no okay cool let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.920" end="00:32:01.730" style="s2">see this is quality is quality science</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.020" end="00:32:01.730" style="s2">boys it&#39;s quality science</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.920" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">all right let&#39;s go Jared you&#39;re new</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.850" end="00:32:16.990" style="s2">around here</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.200" end="01:09:01.640" style="s2">protein thing has to be important</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.759" end="01:09:03.410" style="s2">because unlike you know unlike in code</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.009" end="01:09:37.230" style="s2">like okay amino acids become peptides</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.480" end="01:09:46.060" style="s2">tetrapeptide oh yeah okay this is a 5</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.049" end="01:09:48.359" style="s2">end and the 3 end you I cannot remember</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.489" end="01:10:24.219" style="s2">makes sense that means a chain oh okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.139" end="01:10:28.929" style="s2">it&#39;s straight enough protein that makes</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.219" end="01:10:30.040" style="s2">sense I like Matt peptide so yeah cool</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.929" end="01:10:31.510" style="s2">they&#39;re breaking it down into peptides</p>

<p begin="01:10:31.510" end="01:10:35.650" style="s2">know just like function is like well so</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.670" end="01:10:37.330" style="s2">you have you have like you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.650" end="01:10:39.219" style="s2">like your bites then you have your</p>

<p begin="01:10:45.070" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">peptides will like your basic blocks</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.929" end="01:10:52.380" style="s2">your protein to like your functions so</p>

<p begin="01:27:29.180" end="01:27:35.120" style="s2">it and then this we have this spike</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.590" end="01:27:40.820" style="s2">glycoprotein and we have a bunch of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.120" end="01:27:42.199" style="s2">tiny little functions yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.820" end="01:27:43.730" style="s2">really like this really looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.199" end="01:27:46.520" style="s2">computer program you know you have like</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.730" end="01:27:50.630" style="s2">big function other function maybe M is</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.520" end="01:27:52.930" style="s2">like main you know I really like this</p>

<p begin="01:28:01.200" end="01:28:05.580" style="s2">the spike is the key all right all right</p>

<p begin="01:42:32.520" end="01:42:38.730" style="s2">murder is until it reaches a critter I</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.150" end="01:42:40.260" style="s2">did what&#39;s happening execute the new</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.730" end="01:42:43.830" style="s2">instructions which are pretty simple</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.260" end="01:42:46.650" style="s2">copy and reassemble how does it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.830" end="01:42:48.840" style="s2">execute sir all its victims membranes to</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.650" end="01:42:52.830" style="s2">inject it there&#39;s genetic material okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.840" end="01:42:55.560" style="s2">the shirt sure so you got this exploit</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.830" end="01:42:58.560" style="s2">you got you got a stew it&#39;s vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.560" end="01:43:00.270" style="s2">um this shit shows off this spike shows</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.560" end="01:43:02.970" style="s2">off which is basically just like the</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.270" end="01:43:04.530" style="s2">exploit vector exploit vector comes in</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.970" end="01:43:06.930" style="s2">and jacks its payload all right it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.530" end="01:43:08.160" style="s2">the same shit it&#39;s really all the same</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.930" end="01:43:11.720" style="s2">shit you guys you know your study</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.160" end="01:43:11.720" style="s2">computer security you know this but now</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.640" end="01:43:18.840" style="s2">execute the instructions whatever I</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.900" end="01:43:24.810" style="s2">hijack AIP I jump to the viruses off all</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.840" end="01:43:28.440" style="s2">grey copy and reassemble it fills up but</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.810" end="01:43:36.540" style="s2">where is that where is the copy function</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.440" end="01:43:39.440" style="s2">you know also yo I don&#39;t know how any of</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.540" end="01:43:39.440" style="s2">this shit can work</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.330" end="01:43:49.790" style="s2">search structure of virus okay and then</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.690" end="01:43:52.400" style="s2">it uses reverse transcriptase why the</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.790" end="01:44:05.180" style="s2">hell do I have reverse transcriptase</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.400" end="01:44:08.720" style="s2">I mean is it using this so I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.180" end="01:44:15.880" style="s2">HIV I don&#39;t have leukemia and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.720" end="01:44:15.880" style="s2">have this daltin</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.540" end="01:44:23.210" style="s2">so why do I have any reverse</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.860" end="01:44:25.250" style="s2">transcriptase there were little machines</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.210" end="01:44:36.410" style="s2">in your cells that only make copies of</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.250" end="01:44:38.300" style="s2">RNA what the cells already have a copy</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.410" end="01:44:42.550" style="s2">function oh no the cells have a copy</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.300" end="01:44:42.550" style="s2">function for dear</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.580" end="01:44:48.800" style="s2">not for ribosomes</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.310" end="01:45:00.200" style="s2">this one says ribosomes I&#39;ve heard this</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.800" end="01:45:03.040" style="s2">before no no no ribosomes did you</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.200" end="01:45:05.890" style="s2">translation that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.040" end="01:45:09.290" style="s2">there are cells constantly reading the</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.890" end="01:45:17.560" style="s2">DNA to make proteins okay RNA dependent</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.290" end="01:45:21.580" style="s2">RNA polymerase is this it oh okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.560" end="01:45:21.580" style="s2">is this what it&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.560" end="01:45:36.640" style="s2">you know I believe a lot more in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.660" end="01:45:45.010" style="s2">information about SARS than I do about</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.640" end="01:45:49.030" style="s2">this new shit meth-head Mike I think you</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.010" end="01:45:49.720" style="s2">might have got coronavirus replication</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.030" end="01:45:56.470" style="s2">Oh even better</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.720" end="01:45:58.240" style="s2">ah okay infection begins on the virus</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.470" end="01:46:00.490" style="s2">spread glycoprotein all right so we</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.240" end="01:46:02.110" style="s2">decoded the glycoprotein attaches to its</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.490" end="01:46:05.440" style="s2">complementary host cell receptor which</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.110" end="01:46:08.260" style="s2">is a stew after attachment of protease</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.440" end="01:46:11.680" style="s2">of the host cell Cleaves and activates</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.260" end="01:46:12.880" style="s2">the receptor attach spike protein okay</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.680" end="01:46:16.210" style="s2">so there we go</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.880" end="01:46:23.020" style="s2">you know let&#39;s put it into computer</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.210" end="01:46:26.920" style="s2">terms so the glycoprotein does a heap</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.020" end="01:46:31.180" style="s2">overflow and overflows the next segment</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.920" end="01:46:36.540" style="s2">of malok after the next thing has been</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.180" end="01:46:40.390" style="s2">overflowed a free from the host program</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.540" end="01:46:43.120" style="s2">cleaves and activates the misaligned</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.390" end="01:46:45.990" style="s2">pointer alright it&#39;s like a use after</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.120" end="01:46:48.760" style="s2">free and it frees it I that&#39;s great very</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.990" end="01:46:54.030" style="s2">on the host cell protein available</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.760" end="01:46:56.080" style="s2">cleavage endocytosis</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.030" end="01:46:58.510" style="s2">when entry to the host cell the virus</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.080" end="01:47:03.190" style="s2">particle is uncoated the exploit payload</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.510" end="01:47:07.030" style="s2">is unpacked and its genome enters the</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.190" end="01:47:08.680" style="s2">instruction cache and it&#39;s instructive</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.030" end="01:47:15.750" style="s2">and its code enters the instruction</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.680" end="01:47:19.690" style="s2">cache the corona virus RNA genome has a</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.750" end="01:47:21.760" style="s2">push EW at the beginning of the function</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.690" end="01:47:25.060" style="s2">and a pop a IP at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.760" end="01:47:30.960" style="s2">function which allows the virus to run</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.060" end="01:47:34.300" style="s2">without disrupting anything else okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.960" end="01:47:39.520" style="s2">the sequences written in</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.300" end="01:47:41.650" style="s2">x86 which allows it to yeah translates</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.520" end="01:47:44.080" style="s2">the initial overlapping open reading</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.650" end="01:47:47.350" style="s2">frame and forms a long poly protein</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.080" end="01:47:51.160" style="s2">that&#39;s this shit this is the poly</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.350" end="01:47:52.630" style="s2">protein right yeah your flaw worthless</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.160" end="01:47:54.460" style="s2">the poly protti I don&#39;t know what a poly</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.630" end="01:47:57.880" style="s2">protein is that means it&#39;s got to two</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.460" end="01:47:59.170" style="s2">shits yeah that&#39;s two it has the 1a and</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.880" end="01:48:02.800" style="s2">1b all right cool</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.170" end="01:48:05.020" style="s2">has its own protease is which cleave the</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.800" end="01:48:14.020" style="s2">poly protein into multiple non</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.020" end="01:48:15.190" style="s2">structural what no but what that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.020" end="01:48:17.530" style="s2">what it said did it said it did</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.190" end="01:48:19.680" style="s2">something stupid is this thing lying to</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.530" end="01:48:19.680" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.059" end="01:48:33.369" style="s2">okay the poly protein is very important</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.610" end="01:48:35.730" style="s2">this is the unpacker for the thingy</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.369" end="01:48:35.730" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.179" end="01:48:40.239" style="s2">yeah well share vaccines of subs if I</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.590" end="01:48:41.559" style="s2">find a vaccine I&#39;ll share it with the</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.239" end="01:48:47.380" style="s2">subs that&#39;s right so you better</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.559" end="01:48:49.239" style="s2">subscribe like it&#39;s just so the same you</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.380" end="01:48:50.829" style="s2">know just okay not one of the non</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.239" end="01:48:57.789" style="s2">structural proteins coalesce to form of</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.829" end="01:49:03.940" style="s2">all of the wah ah the non structural</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.789" end="01:49:08.380" style="s2">proteins coalesce replicase yes</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.940" end="01:49:09.820" style="s2">meth-head Mike was right dork mode thank</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.380" end="01:49:11.559" style="s2">you for this link we finally got some</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.820" end="01:49:21.820" style="s2">real information it&#39;s not like a youtube</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.559" end="01:49:24.400" style="s2">video I heard a good joke there was a</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.820" end="01:49:26.710" style="s2">conference the Dutch conference of the</p>

<p begin="01:49:26.710" end="01:49:31.320" style="s2">coronaviruses but it was postponed</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.420" end="01:49:42.159" style="s2">because of the corona virus pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.320" end="01:49:44.260" style="s2">alright we should read this okay ass</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.159" end="01:49:47.909" style="s2">protein okay we got the S protein</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.260" end="01:49:47.909" style="s2">quantifiers is bind on the cell</p>

<p begin="01:49:58.480" end="01:50:06.120" style="s2">and it can produce in the cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.070" end="01:50:09.120" style="s2">first a virus and the size its RNA</p>

<p begin="01:50:14.340" end="01:50:23.870" style="s2">no let&#39;s read about this so I assume I</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.860" end="01:50:23.870" style="s2">have this polymers</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.150" end="01:50:38.550" style="s2">wait why</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.790" end="01:51:05.130" style="s2">so wait a second do I have this protein</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.250" end="01:51:22.370" style="s2">when I&#39;m focusing on anything you</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.190" end="01:51:22.370" style="s2">misunderstand and we&#39;re asking questions</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.820" end="01:51:33.960" style="s2">do I have this protein oh my god no</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.490" end="01:51:36.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what this shit is that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.960" end="01:51:41.250" style="s2">what this or flah prolly protein is is</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.780" end="01:51:47.010" style="s2">the copy mechanism hi I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.250" end="01:51:52.920" style="s2">guess I just assumed that no it is</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.010" end="01:51:57.560" style="s2">look accepted named RNA transcripted RNA</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.920" end="01:52:00.960" style="s2">polymerase it does the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.560" end="01:52:08.750" style="s2">nucleotides triphosphate ATP is</p>

<p begin="01:52:30.960" end="01:52:54.180" style="s2">protein is the copy mechanism copy spike</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.050" end="01:52:57.510" style="s2">and then reassemble with the little</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.180" end="01:53:00.000" style="s2">shitty Co okay won&#39;t make sense all</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.510" end="01:53:01.770" style="s2">right so it looks like this virus is</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.000" end="01:53:03.420" style="s2">spending weii I mean it makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.770" end="01:53:11.400" style="s2">sense that this virus is spending</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.420" end="01:53:13.080" style="s2">two-thirds of its code copying this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.400" end="01:53:15.210" style="s2">yeah yeah this is this is basically a</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.080" end="01:53:16.950" style="s2">minimum like RNA copy Ritchie because I</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.210" end="01:53:20.190" style="s2">knew your body didn&#39;t have RNA copy</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.950" end="01:53:23.160" style="s2">routines the spike glycoprotein this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.190" end="01:53:25.290" style="s2">this is the this is the exploit this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.160" end="01:53:27.360" style="s2">the payload and the payload basically</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.290" end="01:53:47.700" style="s2">just says make a copy and these are a</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.360" end="01:53:50.220" style="s2">few helper functions I look at this</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.700" end="01:53:52.080" style="s2">stuff and I have a framework right like</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.220" end="01:53:53.670" style="s2">I have a framework I have a framework</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.080" end="01:53:55.230" style="s2">with which to think about all this right</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.670" end="01:53:58.350" style="s2">like you know you write computer viruses</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.230" end="01:53:59.700" style="s2">you know how to do this all these people</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.350" end="01:54:03.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t even think they had those</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.700" end="01:54:08.460" style="s2">frameworks like and then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.690" end="01:54:10.500" style="s2">I mean I I come into this world really</p>

<p begin="02:13:27.470" end="02:13:39.530" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it yeah but again all right</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.810" end="02:13:41.840" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.530" end="02:13:44.720" style="s2">I have lots of copies of my DNA I got my</p>

<p begin="02:13:44.720" end="02:13:59.320" style="s2">but like well huh actually wouldn&#39;t the</p>

<p begin="02:14:05.510" end="02:14:09.080" style="s2">yeah viral is different from bacteria</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.100" end="02:14:11.630" style="s2">but no I&#39;m saying that you make that DNA</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.080" end="02:14:14.120" style="s2">right so I mean the bacteria like e-coli</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.630" end="02:14:15.070" style="s2">is gonna have all the transcriptase</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.120" end="02:14:22.960" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.070" end="02:14:25.630" style="s2">why not long cells are eukaryotic okay</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.960" end="02:14:27.770" style="s2">yeah I know viruses can infect bacteria</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.630" end="02:14:35.780" style="s2">exactly so basically I&#39;m you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:15:08.450" end="02:15:12.010" style="s2">heard about this once</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.869" end="02:15:22.090" style="s2">yeah okay I can see how that works</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.690" end="02:15:26.100" style="s2">you carry out</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.999" end="02:15:39.469" style="s2">yeah okay so it&#39;s got to have a nucleus</p>
