<p begin="00:19:00.620" end="00:19:03.490" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.800" end="00:19:21.010" style="s2">now I have to go through and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">everywhere I created a record here we</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.930" end="00:20:12.420" style="s2">so the idea is we want every file to be</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:48.540" style="s2">so what rebuild does is if your database</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.100" end="00:20:55.260" style="s2">breaks you can regenerate it okay don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:18.670" style="s2">we&#39;re rebuilding just the level DB it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.539" end="01:21:44.630" style="s2">now I can&#39;t do that anymore yeah do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.320" end="01:21:51.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.620" end="01:22:07.210" style="s2">median of two sorted arrays who said I</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.450" end="01:22:07.210" style="s2">can&#39;t do the hard ones fine</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.460" end="01:22:11.660" style="s2">the median</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.239" end="01:22:24.920" style="s2">of the two sorted or oh wow this is all</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.630" end="01:22:26.690" style="s2">this is verify my email all right you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.920" end="01:22:28.700" style="s2">know what they just made it too hard for</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.690" end="01:22:38.860" style="s2">me you know what&#39;s it called quick</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.700" end="01:22:38.860" style="s2">select the algorithm unordered list</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.550" end="01:22:46.980" style="s2">on median of the two sorted arrays</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:22.120" style="s2">it&#39;s better not interfere with my</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.840" end="01:23:35.210" style="s2">oh you can&#39;t see anything oh I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.309" end="01:23:44.739" style="s2">oh you have to look at my face us funny</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.690" end="01:23:59.449" style="s2">no no no we definitely don&#39;t do any</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.639" end="01:24:01.730" style="s2">portables all right median of two</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.449" end="01:24:04.360" style="s2">sorters is it confirmed my email let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.730" end="01:24:07.849" style="s2">go come on come on</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.360" end="01:24:11.260" style="s2">gigabit internet this doesn&#39;t work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.849" end="01:24:11.260" style="s2">gonna charge my Apple watch what we</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.410" end="01:24:36.270" style="s2">okay the median of the two sorted arrays</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.299" end="01:25:11.749" style="s2">I mean see this is the problem all right</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.679" end="01:25:20.629" style="s2">well we&#39;ve all we won&#39;t Google we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.749" end="01:25:22.879" style="s2">just try to think about damn look at</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.629" end="01:25:32.689" style="s2">those uh those type signatures on that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.879" end="01:25:34.909" style="s2">Python um well okay so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.689" end="01:25:36.729" style="s2">algorithm guys like this one is hard I</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.909" end="01:25:39.679" style="s2">want to point out and it is way easier</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.729" end="01:25:41.329" style="s2">than that one I did on well let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.679" end="01:25:43.039" style="s2">about let&#39;s watch it talk more after I</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.329" end="01:25:47.019" style="s2">solve it okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.039" end="01:25:47.019" style="s2">med one equals</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.540" end="01:26:12.050" style="s2">yeah you understand it has to be oh so</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.340" end="01:26:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like you got to do something like</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.050" end="01:26:15.770" style="s2">okay you got the two medians right and</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.240" end="01:26:23.870" style="s2">you gotta like get them to converge or</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.770" end="01:26:24.830" style="s2">some shit like right so the algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.870" end="01:26:33.770" style="s2">probably something</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.830" end="01:26:37.250" style="s2">this is stupid guys yeah merge the</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.770" end="01:26:39.140" style="s2">arrays and resort well so first off you</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.250" end="01:26:40.970" style="s2">don&#39;t have to merge the Iranian resource</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.140" end="01:26:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to zip the two together</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.970" end="01:26:47.150" style="s2">but that of course would be O of M plus</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.480" end="01:26:52.490" style="s2">N and then that&#39;s too much oh we need</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.150" end="01:26:54.770" style="s2">less oh well it&#39;s like you guys do like</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.490" end="01:26:59.890" style="s2">binary search on the on the things right</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.770" end="01:26:59.890" style="s2">like you got like the the the the two</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.100" end="01:27:04.100" style="s2">and then you&#39;re gonna move one of them</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.750" end="01:27:08.350" style="s2">this way and you&#39;re gonna move one of</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.100" end="01:27:08.350" style="s2">them that way right</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.900" end="01:27:23.430" style="s2">so in an extreme case the first list</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.860" end="01:27:25.170" style="s2">contains everybody in one case the two</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.430" end="01:27:28.500" style="s2">lists are exactly absolutely identical</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.170" end="01:27:31.650" style="s2">and then you want to know in an extreme</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.500" end="01:27:33.210" style="s2">case the first list is all smaller and</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.650" end="01:27:37.130" style="s2">the second list is all larger so you</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.210" end="01:27:37.130" style="s2">actually want the the average of the two</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.910" end="01:27:48.700" style="s2">now you guys do like binary search on</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.400" end="01:27:48.700" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.349" end="01:28:05.610" style="s2">and let&#39;s say so the medium can be an</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.420" end="01:28:15.179" style="s2">average of two but it can never be an</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.610" end="01:28:17.789" style="s2">average of more than two so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.179" end="01:28:22.710" style="s2">answer is gonna be yeah you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.789" end="01:28:24.389" style="s2">have like low and high right but do I</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.710" end="01:28:32.400" style="s2">have to Lowe&#39;s and two highs and then I</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.389" end="01:28:37.670" style="s2">guess I do check the last one in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.400" end="01:28:37.670" style="s2">first or i of the yeah I understand</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.050" end="01:28:47.460" style="s2">feeling like Google interview this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.099" end="01:28:53.159" style="s2">hard no one knows this algorithm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.460" end="01:28:54.749" style="s2">binary search right you could search for</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.159" end="01:28:56.099" style="s2">a single element now search for the</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.749" end="01:28:57.269" style="s2">median right yeah well at least this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.099" end="01:28:58.710" style="s2">clever at least like this isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.269" end="01:29:01.190" style="s2">involve a lot of code once you figure</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.710" end="01:29:01.190" style="s2">out this solution</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.600" end="01:29:12.450" style="s2">just merge sort and find the median yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.370" end="01:29:16.360" style="s2">that sounds great except for this oh</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.450" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">yeah oh yeah yeah try that try that and</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.360" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">see if that&#39;s you know yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.010" end="01:29:49.719" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t that sound fun yeah here we</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.539" end="01:29:51.929" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.719" end="01:29:51.929" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.349" end="01:30:06.310" style="s2">about syntax</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.099" end="01:30:14.770" style="s2">well see look beautiful Wow works so</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.010" end="01:30:16.449" style="s2">well guys oh yeah yeah there you go</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.770" end="01:30:27.219" style="s2">all right yeah who cares this hello</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.449" end="01:30:42.329" style="s2">again it doesn&#39;t matter nothing tea on</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.219" end="01:30:42.329" style="s2">my shirt okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.840" end="01:30:47.969" style="s2">but think about a normal medium</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.369" end="01:31:16.659" style="s2">lisam it&#39;s not right let me handle this</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.790" end="01:31:18.250" style="s2">case it&#39;s interesting to also note that</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.659" end="01:31:22.360" style="s2">there&#39;s always gonna be an even number</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.250" end="01:31:26.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s okay the different sizes so</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.360" end="01:31:33.489" style="s2">never mind no pan thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.560" end="01:31:52.469" style="s2">subscribing oh my god no one equals zero</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.489" end="01:31:52.469" style="s2">I want one we have our two lessons</p>

<p begin="02:33:36.721" end="02:33:47.070" style="s2">way even to quantify using probability</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.210" end="02:33:49.830" style="s2">distributions see that&#39;s that&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.070" end="02:33:51.000" style="s2">what this means right I mean usually we</p>
<p begin="02:33:49.830" end="02:33:52.530" style="s2">think of uncertainty right if you have</p>

<p begin="02:34:11.301" end="02:34:20.160" style="s2">system that to predict it would require</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.860" end="02:34:21.540" style="s2">as much computation power as to run it</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.160" end="02:34:24.931" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s effectively</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.540" end="02:34:27.830" style="s2">unpredictable especially if the system</p>
