<p begin="00:14:57.290" end="00:15:04.130" style="s2">correlated batch normalization so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.870" end="00:15:06.860" style="s2">gonna try to implement this intensive</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.130" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">flow and we&#39;ll see what goes so if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.860" end="00:15:11.510" style="s2">guys know what Bachelor realization is</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:14.180" style="s2">uh D correlated batch normalization</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.510" end="00:15:16.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a projective transform on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.180" end="00:15:17.930" style="s2">vector space 2d correlate the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.640" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">right because if you&#39;re if you&#39;re things</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.930" end="00:15:21.650" style="s2">in your neural net are correlated you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:25.220" style="s2">wasting capacity but if you can D</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.650" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">correlate them you get capacity back so</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.220" end="00:15:29.930" style="s2">it&#39;s really exciting and you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:31.850" style="s2">you can do it you see like you can&#39;t D</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.930" end="00:15:33.140" style="s2">correlate in a nonlinear way but you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.850" end="00:15:34.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:38.050" style="s2">correlation in a linear way you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.640" end="00:15:40.550" style="s2">actually do that transformation um</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.050" end="00:15:42.380" style="s2">who&#39;d have thought that linear algebra</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.550" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">was gonna be the science that was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.380" end="00:15:49.640" style="s2">change the that was gonna determine our</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:52.390" style="s2">future linear algebra and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.640" end="00:15:54.770" style="s2">of calculus heõs to know much calculus</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.390" end="00:15:56.090" style="s2">it was perfect it&#39;s this perfect like</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.100" end="00:31:05.130" style="s2">human before we get to me we don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.440" end="00:31:07.320" style="s2">evolutionary algorithms because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.130" end="00:31:09.660" style="s2">not as powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.320" end="00:31:12.420" style="s2">search like they&#39;re not as powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.660" end="00:31:13.710" style="s2">convex optimization right if you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.420" end="00:31:16.170" style="s2">about what gave rise to humans maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.710" end="00:31:19.280" style="s2">evolution design the architecture but</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.170" end="00:31:21.300" style="s2">the learning the real power comes from</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.300" end="00:31:25.320" style="s2">learning algorithms then the search is</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.850" end="00:31:26.520" style="s2">just way less powerful you can show that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.320" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">convex optimization is just more</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.520" end="00:31:31.620" style="s2">powerful there&#39;s a guy on periscope that</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.750" end="00:31:38.460" style="s2">people will be working on so winning</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.750" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">self-driving cars I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.460" end="00:31:41.460" style="s2">the whole problem right like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:43.080" style="s2">win self-driving cars so you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.460" end="00:31:45.960" style="s2">working on things like things like map</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.080" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">and things like machine learning you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.960" end="00:31:52.800" style="s2">know how do you so we have maps right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.120" style="s2">gotta put them all on a big map we got</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.800" end="00:31:57.930" style="s2">to do we got to put that in a database</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.120" end="00:32:00.840" style="s2">so we can quickly access it when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.930" end="00:32:02.040" style="s2">upload my brain on a computer okay I got</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.840" end="00:32:04.260" style="s2">to be a little bit careful with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.040" end="00:32:05.610" style="s2">what do I think about Bill Gates or</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.260" end="00:32:07.980" style="s2">Steve Jobs something like Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.610" end="00:32:10.140" style="s2">versus Steve Jobs I mean they both have</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.980" end="00:32:11.910" style="s2">things going for them it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.140" end="00:32:13.860" style="s2">real information still about Steve Jobs</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.910" end="00:32:17.100" style="s2">because he&#39;s kind of a deified after his</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.860" end="00:32:19.350" style="s2">death so throwing planes not to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.100" end="00:32:20.940" style="s2">honest actually to be honest if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.350" end="00:32:22.680" style="s2">talking about cities these like small</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.680" end="00:32:24.090" style="s2">don&#39;t do machine learning read the</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.280" end="00:32:57.540" style="s2">he&#39;s my sequel on the back end what does</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:00.770" style="s2">comma hardware look like an 18 months</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.540" end="00:33:03.510" style="s2">well you&#39;ll say just a cramp</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">this stuff better way case</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.370" end="00:33:23.790" style="s2">do you work with no sequel big data</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:26.610" style="s2">stuffs um so a lot of art like big big</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.790" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">stuff is stored as flat files no so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.610" end="00:33:32.060" style="s2">don&#39;t like put them videos in my cygwin</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:33.620" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s all done as flat files 360</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.620" end="00:33:38.160" style="s2">but no I mean it&#39;s gonna be like if</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.160" end="00:33:42.870" style="s2">gonna be a lot more expensive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.470" end="00:33:45.270" style="s2">not gonna be much more at first we gotta</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.870" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">get there everyone will go yeah cloud is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.270" end="00:33:49.830" style="s2">a great idea right everyone should go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:51.210" style="s2">the cloud except for like GPUs now</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.830" end="00:33:52.410" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s still really</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.210" end="00:33:54.450" style="s2">expensive in the cloud so it&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.410" end="00:33:56.040" style="s2">to have my premise but if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.450" end="00:33:58.790" style="s2">about just compute and keeping servers</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.040" end="00:34:03.590" style="s2">off and reliability and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.790" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">you want to go cloud maybe stereo say</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.590" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">what I think about quantum computing I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:10.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s mostly a scam yeah even the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.460" end="00:34:12.780" style="s2">other side is actually this is a a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.250" end="00:34:16.050" style="s2">quantum computing probably mostly a scam</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.780" end="00:34:18.060" style="s2">I believe that P equals B Q P if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.050" end="00:34:19.410" style="s2">want to get real in depth about this I</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.060" end="00:34:22.290" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any problems that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.410" end="00:34:23.910" style="s2">quantum computers can solve faster than</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.290" end="00:34:25.410" style="s2">classical computers I do think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.910" end="00:34:28.140" style="s2">classical time factoring algorithm I</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.410" end="00:34:31.560" style="s2">think will find it like ten years of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.140" end="00:34:33.860" style="s2">privacy guys get over it get over</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.560" end="00:34:37.920" style="s2">privacy if you&#39;re interested in privacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:40.520" style="s2">you just you gonna lose you build a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.920" end="00:34:42.630" style="s2">recommender system why</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.520" end="00:34:44.070" style="s2">seems like all manufactures gonna come a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.630" end="00:34:45.210" style="s2">self-driving future yeah just like all</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.070" end="00:34:47.820" style="s2">phones come with smartphone feature</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.210" end="00:34:49.020" style="s2">except they run Android right all phones</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.820" end="00:34:50.400" style="s2">are gonna come with internet browser</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.020" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">well yeah and like some of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.400" end="00:34:52.920" style="s2">manufacturers tried to make their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:54.660" style="s2">phone with internet browser and we know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.920" end="00:34:57.360" style="s2">exactly how that ended up miss your</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.360" end="00:35:00.090" style="s2">yeah don&#39;t use the Internet if you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:01.740" style="s2">about privacy that&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.090" end="00:35:02.820" style="s2">you want privacy go live in a cabin and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.740" end="00:35:04.140" style="s2">honestly people still find your I</p>
