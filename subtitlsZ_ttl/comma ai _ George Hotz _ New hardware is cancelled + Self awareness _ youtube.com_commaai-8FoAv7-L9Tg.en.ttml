<p begin="00:23:18.360" end="00:23:22.500" style="s2">it depends on the scenario open-mouth</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">better and some autopilot is better and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.500" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">some auto pilot chooses to feel more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:32.580" style="s2">confident trading off being ok with</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.090" end="00:23:43.530" style="s2">limits much lower not only because of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.669" end="00:23:44.970" style="s2">the cars just because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.530" end="00:23:47.429" style="s2">Tesla&#39;s a little bit aggressive with</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.970" end="00:23:50.429" style="s2">that Tesla&#39;s hardware is a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.429" end="00:23:53.340" style="s2">than ours you know we have a phone in</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">just got here what happened well the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.650" end="00:24:05.250" style="s2">July 1st hardware&#39;s canceled so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re waiting if you were waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.250" end="00:24:09.240" style="s2">buy your Aeon for the new hardware</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">there&#39;s no more new hardware so you know</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:25.380" style="s2">heard from Tesla in 3 years no one&#39;s to</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">like that the companies to blame yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.650" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">they&#39;re as verified can&#39;t run a can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:40.049" style="s2">run yeah the EON de on isn&#39;t nearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:42.929" style="s2">even in its limits of potential right</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.049" end="00:24:44.070" style="s2">for example open pilots not that good</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.929" end="00:24:45.870" style="s2">when you have like when you&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.070" end="00:24:47.970" style="s2">with a stopped car at the radar vision</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.870" end="00:24:49.559" style="s2">fusion this has everything to do with</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.570" end="00:25:09.820" style="s2">to do with the hardware no see but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.259" end="00:25:11.349" style="s2">twitch see if the twitch became a thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.820" end="00:25:13.869" style="s2">I just wouldn&#39;t want to do it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.349" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">it already kind of became a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.869" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">everything good what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.899" end="00:25:25.529" style="s2">all I can promise you guys is I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.669" end="00:25:25.529" style="s2">go out honestly that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.899" end="00:25:29.769" style="s2">yawn really only helps lateral movement</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.909" end="00:25:31.509" style="s2">well it depends on the car some of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.769" end="00:25:32.830" style="s2">cars have good longitudinal some of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.509" end="00:25:34.389" style="s2">have terrible longitudinal like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.830" end="00:25:40.719" style="s2">Civic stock longitudinals way worse than</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.389" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">the Aeons oh the new hardware it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.719" end="00:25:46.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not a neon it was never gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:48.129" style="s2">neon replacement anyway can the new</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.539" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">hardware be community produce like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.129" end="00:25:57.179" style="s2">pedal mm too complex look if we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">get it right then I don&#39;t know about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.179" end="00:26:04.450" style="s2">open sourcing if the pedal was simple we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:11.049" style="s2">already had pedals any plastic Aeons who</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.450" end="00:26:12.309" style="s2">wants to buy a mini plastic healing what</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.049" end="00:26:14.229" style="s2">was the new hardware anyway the new</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.309" end="00:26:15.219" style="s2">hardware was mini plastic eons but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.229" end="00:26:19.479" style="s2">don&#39;t look very nice</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.219" end="00:26:21.909" style="s2">so we cancel them roll call may I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.479" end="00:26:24.269" style="s2">in 10 years probably none most out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.909" end="00:26:24.269" style="s2">sale</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">what channel would source everything god</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.720" end="00:26:40.850" style="s2">I&#39;d open source the back end I mean if I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:42.350" style="s2">thought someone could use it and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.850" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">thought that the value would be captured</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.350" end="00:26:50.780" style="s2">by people and not by entities well</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:55.730" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.780" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">it was because well it&#39;s canceled so and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.730" end="00:26:59.270" style="s2">then like we&#39;re gonna do like a fake</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.310" style="s2">event tomorrow where it&#39;s like oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.270" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">gonna win ounce plastic Aeons and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.310" end="00:27:05.810" style="s2">it&#39;s funny at first when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:09.680" style="s2">it but then you realize like wow okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.810" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">look up intel the odyssey right if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.680" end="00:27:12.770" style="s2">want if you want something to laugh</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.930" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.770" end="00:27:17.780" style="s2">oh please consider ah now I&#39;m a magnetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.930" end="00:27:20.810" style="s2">sticker manufacturer really ship black</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.780" end="00:27:23.510" style="s2">rain to 21 million people in a week and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.810" end="00:27:28.070" style="s2">now I make magnetic stickers that 26</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.510" end="00:27:29.390" style="s2">people are gonna buy pathetic you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.070" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">need more care you don&#39;t even really</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.390" end="00:27:33.020" style="s2">need more cameras we&#39;re not even nearly</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">at the limit of the EON camera for</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.020" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">example cut-ins</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">alright when cars cut you off the e on</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:40.190" style="s2">camera can see this fine the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:41.630" style="s2">it&#39;s just not in the field of view or</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.190" end="00:27:44.380" style="s2">vive there the model or the radar right</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.630" end="00:27:44.380" style="s2">we can fix that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:49.070" style="s2">it&#39;s don&#39;t challenge and left driving</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.480" end="00:27:51.950" style="s2">countries we could just care about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.070" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">the problem is we have like 20 users</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.950" end="00:27:57.460" style="s2">right so let&#39;s see 20 users maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:28:01.130" style="s2">lifetime user value of calm AI is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.460" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">$500 so 20 times 500 that&#39;s $10,000</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.130" end="00:28:06.440" style="s2">right so I can devote maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">engineering month to it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.440" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">problem all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">no it doesn&#39;t detect gardens haifa</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:18.770" style="s2">Tesla&#39;s battery event you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:20.540" style="s2">gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.770" end="00:28:22.220" style="s2">I gotta promise something they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.540" end="00:28:25.370" style="s2">be like kind of there and yeah you all</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.220" end="00:28:26.570" style="s2">probably win at the end of it is open</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.370" end="00:28:28.010" style="s2">sourcing everything really a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.570" end="00:28:29.300" style="s2">business decision well keeping some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.010" end="00:28:32.570" style="s2">it closed wasn&#39;t a good business</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.300" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">decision so at least you know with open</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.570" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">source there&#39;s a legacy right</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.970" end="00:28:44.330" style="s2">why not flip the camera out but you mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.110" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">flip it like that um so we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.330" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">that uh I don&#39;t know maybe it works</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.190" end="00:29:09.140" style="s2">of made sense so okay with open sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:12.650" style="s2">we have a lot of people contributing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.140" end="00:29:19.940" style="s2">free a to an extent um the truth about</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.650" end="00:29:22.010" style="s2">the truth about open sourcing is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.940" end="00:29:24.200" style="s2">then you then just become a manager</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.010" end="00:29:26.630" style="s2">right like a lot of times I&#39;d rather a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.200" end="00:29:29.720" style="s2">lot of times I&#39;d rather write code then</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.720" end="00:29:34.670" style="s2">code that&#39;s like bad all right like like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.900" end="00:29:35.960" style="s2">there is there is almost more overhead</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.670" end="00:29:37.790" style="s2">than just writing some of the code</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.790" end="00:29:42.440" style="s2">source contributions but the idea that</p>
