<p begin="00:01:39.020" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">software so back in 2017 the open</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">sourced this thing called open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">which is essentially autopilot for</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.590" end="00:02:50.780" style="s2">wanted to go and build a system that ran</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.410" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">the software and then sell that system</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.780" end="00:02:56.540" style="s2">they&#39;d be completely entitled to we are</p>

<p begin="00:03:05.239" end="00:03:10.010" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t have a business</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">development department we have we have a</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.370" end="00:03:34.910" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about this car that none</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.079" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">of us had seen I don&#39;t think very many</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.910" end="00:03:38.900" style="s2">had even heard about it 10 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">then the the person who&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.900" end="00:03:42.260" style="s2">demonstration said by the way if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">want to drive in it it&#39;s out this door</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.260" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2">on the parking lot and 1800 people stood</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:49.340" style="s2">up and went running and I got to drive</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:51.530" style="s2">it and I have a video on my laptop of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.340" end="00:03:52.910" style="s2">driving in this Prius 10 years ago with</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.530" end="00:03:54.590" style="s2">Mort Matt Groening the founder of The</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.910" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">Simpsons was beside me in the vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.590" end="00:03:59.780" style="s2">and we drove on a test track 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:01.720" style="s2">ago at 45 miles an hour and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.780" end="00:04:03.109" style="s2">going holy like this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;ve since owned to Teslas I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">been driving them now for years how</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">how complex I got so so MIT labs</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.600" end="00:04:15.960" style="s2">developed the software and then you guys</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">are third-party licensing it or did you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.960" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">develop my choice yeah we developed the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">software it&#39;s under MIT license but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:28.920" style="s2">did develop a software and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">basically we you know we maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.920" end="00:04:33.060" style="s2">software the beauty of having open</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">source software is that one you get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.060" end="00:04:37.500" style="s2">community that can contribute to it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">there&#39;s so many you know there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:41.430" style="s2">makes and models out there that are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">little different and how they run</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">and so when you community member that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">wants this to be supported for their car</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:50.670" style="s2">and if they go through the effort to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">know send a pull request to have their</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.670" end="00:04:54.600" style="s2">car supported and merged with you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.010" style="s2">the next version of open pilot like</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.600" end="00:04:58.140" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.010" end="00:05:01.070" style="s2">community of people that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.140" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">actively working to basically like it to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.070" end="00:05:08.010" style="s2">you know to push forward the technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">and also a beautiful thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.010" end="00:05:14.490" style="s2">open-source code is that code is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:16.440" style="s2">know anyone can if anyone&#39;s concerned</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">with the code they can go and read</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.440" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">through it they can you know if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:23.130" style="s2">safety concerns or whatever to some</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">extent code is speech so they can go</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.130" end="00:05:29.190" style="s2">ahead and have their you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:30.390" style="s2">look at everything we do and decide for</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">themselves if this is something they</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.390" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">want to put in their car instead of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">getting into you know like a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">know a Honda Civic with the lane keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:42.330" style="s2">assist system and having really little</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:44.250" style="s2">idea of how it works and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.330" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">you know trust and get and engaging it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.250" end="00:05:51.090" style="s2">and seeing it for yourself you know how</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:53.400" style="s2">it works on the road and so why am I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.090" end="00:05:55.290" style="s2">scared of this why is this got me work</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.400" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">with the open-source idea that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.290" end="00:05:58.470" style="s2">can just download this and put it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:00.390" style="s2">their car why is that scaring the hell</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.470" end="00:06:02.580" style="s2">out of me when I went again I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.390" end="00:06:04.170" style="s2">you know I drove my Tesla Model 3 from</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.580" end="00:06:06.390" style="s2">Scottsdale to Vancouver and let it drive</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.170" end="00:06:07.980" style="s2">2000 or the 2200 miles on its own but</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.390" end="00:06:08.370" style="s2">this scares me for some reason what am I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.980" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">missing</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.370" end="00:06:13.890" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a couple of reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:17.220" style="s2">these is scary and the first one is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.890" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">any time there&#39;s a autonomous vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.220" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">accident like it is so publicized it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.580" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">possible so we have so so many ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">our head that like these systems aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:35.930" style="s2">safe or you know oh but did you see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">you know this auto pilot accident caused</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.930" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">this issue whereas it&#39;s like sure along</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">with that article what if we also</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:45.979" style="s2">publicize how many people die just by</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">driving a regular car that sertoli yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.979" end="00:06:50.599" style="s2">I think there&#39;s that level that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:55.250" style="s2">little alarming the open source code I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.599" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">think also scares people because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.250" end="00:06:59.389" style="s2">want to say that any of like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">like responsibility is the hardware to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.389" end="00:07:05.389" style="s2">place in this situation but Minh dove</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">like hey take a look at our code if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.389" end="00:07:10.280" style="s2">like our code then maybe you&#39;ll you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:13.490" style="s2">want to explore and experiment with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.280" end="00:07:15.889" style="s2">and and and see how it runs with your</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.490" end="00:07:20.210" style="s2">Honda Civic and so there&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.889" end="00:07:23.029" style="s2">active active like exploration phase</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.210" end="00:07:24.620" style="s2">that the driver is is using because</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.029" end="00:07:26.509" style="s2">they&#39;re downloading this code from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.620" end="00:07:29.000" style="s2">internet and they&#39;re they&#39;re trying it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.509" end="00:07:32.360" style="s2">in their vehicle as opposed to kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.000" end="00:07:34.669" style="s2">black box delivery of you know Tesla</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.360" end="00:07:36.259" style="s2">autopilot here you are take a drive but</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.669" end="00:07:37.580" style="s2">we&#39;re like where are they testing this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.259" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">oh they&#39;re downloading the software and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.580" end="00:07:39.560" style="s2">they&#39;re just throwing it in their car</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">and they&#39;re going for a drive around</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.560" end="00:07:47.990" style="s2">Scottsdale sure yeah I mean we have we</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:50.389" style="s2">have millions of miles of driving data</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.990" end="00:07:51.830" style="s2">from this we have hundreds of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.389" end="00:07:55.069" style="s2">videos of people driving around with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.830" end="00:07:57.289" style="s2">system so well where are they testing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.069" end="00:08:00.199" style="s2">like they&#39;re you know it&#39;s it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.289" end="00:08:02.750" style="s2">testing almost than any other</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.199" end="00:08:04.009" style="s2">self-driving car companies product</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.750" end="00:08:06.529" style="s2">because they don&#39;t even have a product</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.009" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">really you know like there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.529" end="00:08:10.940" style="s2">many I mean part of the big issue too is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">like there&#39;s so many edge cases with</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.940" end="00:08:16.099" style="s2">drivings that it&#39;s impossible to to hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:18.409" style="s2">code all of the edge cases of driving</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.099" end="00:08:19.729" style="s2">George I think it like Elon Musk had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.409" end="00:08:22.550" style="s2">line when we first came out with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.729" end="00:08:24.050" style="s2">system and he was like you know sure 99%</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.550" end="00:08:28.009" style="s2">of this is easy it&#39;s the one percent</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.050" end="00:08:30.649" style="s2">that&#39;s really hard right but when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.009" end="00:08:32.839" style="s2">try to capture all of the edge cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.649" end="00:08:34.250" style="s2">like way mo with like I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.839" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">their fleet is let&#39;s say their fleets</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.250" end="00:08:38.200" style="s2">like a hundred cars or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s still just that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.200" end="00:08:41.979" style="s2">get you all of the edge cases and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:45.730" style="s2">when you&#39;re just relying and depending</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.979" end="00:08:47.850" style="s2">on you know all of the the all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:50.829" style="s2">data from your own cars as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.850" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">kind of like decentralizing the data</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.829" end="00:08:56.019" style="s2">consumption and getting data from people</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">all over the world you know all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.019" end="00:09:03.579" style="s2">sudden you have a much more like fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:06.790" style="s2">packaged kind of you know data</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.579" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">exploration to go whether were there a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.790" end="00:09:10.769" style="s2">lot of legal hurdles in getting launched</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">or getting the product out the door</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.769" end="00:09:16.060" style="s2">certainly so yeah I mean we we got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">letter from the National Highway</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">Transportation Safety Authority back in</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:27.550" style="s2">2016 and so I yes so so we we actually I</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:30.339" style="s2">think I think the open source in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.550" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">who knows the years are all the same but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.339" end="00:09:33.970" style="s2">regardless they they were concerned we</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:36.940" style="s2">had announced at TechCrunch that we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:39.459" style="s2">selling this product with open pilot on</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.940" end="00:09:41.050" style="s2">the product and that this product was</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.459" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">going to drive your car I mean it was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.050" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">lot of hype the product can&#39;t drive you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:47.199" style="s2">know nothing can drive your car you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:49.959" style="s2">still can&#39;t sit in a self-driving car</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.199" end="00:09:53.290" style="s2">everything driver assistance system</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.959" end="00:09:56.140" style="s2">still level two and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.290" end="00:09:58.149" style="s2">definitely you know I think similar when</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.140" end="00:10:00.550" style="s2">you ask why am I scared of this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.149" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">just a lack of information around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.550" end="00:10:05.949" style="s2">of this stuff and so a big thing with</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:08.649" style="s2">open sourcing it&#39;s like how do we show</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.949" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">the information how do we you know how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.649" end="00:10:12.279" style="s2">do we just like yeah explain like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">going on and and and publish more of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.279" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">information publish more of the data we</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:17.260" style="s2">definitely tried to do this with like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:19.209" style="s2">more medium posts we&#39;ve tried to publish</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.260" end="00:10:20.769" style="s2">more you know like this is how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.209" end="00:10:24.390" style="s2">using the data this is how we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.769" end="00:10:27.310" style="s2">we&#39;re being compliant with NHTSA&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.390" end="00:10:30.790" style="s2">requests they basically sent a list of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.310" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">17 questions I think was about 17 and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.790" end="00:10:33.190" style="s2">they were totally reasonable they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">totally reasonable questions asking us</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.190" end="00:10:36.600" style="s2">you know like what what is this product</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:42.460" style="s2">what is it doing how can you guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.600" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">certain aspects about the product and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.460" end="00:10:48.910" style="s2">but apart from that I think the I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:51.490" style="s2">like the trend of the general</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.910" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">self-driving space is moving more</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.490" end="00:10:56.470" style="s2">towards like not even away from</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:58.090" style="s2">regulation but like when you have you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.470" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">know lame-o come out and announce that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.090" end="00:11:02.260" style="s2">they like hyped it up a little too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">for the first X years that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.260" end="00:11:06.580" style="s2">you know working on self-driving cars or</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:08.260" style="s2">you have all these companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.580" end="00:11:10.840" style="s2">slowly realizing like this problem is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.260" end="00:11:13.660" style="s2">actually really difficult like not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.840" end="00:11:17.770" style="s2">regulation catches up but it just the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:19.690" style="s2">the problem slows down that the pace you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.770" end="00:11:21.490" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be solved slows down and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.690" end="00:11:23.080" style="s2">that reassures people automatically yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:24.250" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also the people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.080" end="00:11:25.870" style="s2">more and more comfortable with it now</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.250" end="00:11:27.700" style="s2">we&#39;re just we&#39;re not hearing about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.870" end="00:11:29.080" style="s2">accidents constantly we have heard the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.700" end="00:11:30.220" style="s2">arguments now that there&#39;s other cars</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.080" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">that are crashing we&#39;re not hearing</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.220" end="00:11:32.740" style="s2">about those so I think we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">getting more and more comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.740" end="00:11:36.670" style="s2">the idea and then we&#39;re also you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:38.770" style="s2">four years ago it was just weird or five</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.670" end="00:11:40.810" style="s2">years ago was weird hearing a Tesla</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.770" end="00:11:43.030" style="s2">creep up behind you and now it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.810" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">you you almost can hear them now which</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.030" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">is so bizarre right we could never hear</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:48.700" style="s2">them before and now we can hear them</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:52.270" style="s2">which is really strange so how did you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.700" end="00:11:54.940" style="s2">get involved in the company so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.270" end="00:11:57.190" style="s2">founder I lived in this house called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.940" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">crypto castle in San Francisco very San</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.190" end="00:12:01.630" style="s2">Francisco it was basically a three-story</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.890" end="00:12:04.120" style="s2">townhouse in downtown San Francisco with</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.630" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">a bunch of people who were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.120" end="00:12:10.030" style="s2">Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and George</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:12.220" style="s2">the founder moved into the basement of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.030" end="00:12:13.870" style="s2">this house he was basically looking to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.220" end="00:12:15.520" style="s2">start his own self-driving car start up</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.870" end="00:12:20.710" style="s2">and needed a basement where he could</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.520" end="00:12:25.090" style="s2">pack away a car and so I&#39;m and became</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.710" end="00:12:27.520" style="s2">friends he I like just lived and saw him</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.090" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">develop this company for the first like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">seven or eight months and then in about</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:38.530" style="s2">a year later three and a half years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">he was looking for an Operations person</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.530" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">and I went up to him and I said he</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:45.190" style="s2">should hire me and definitely took some</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:49.510" style="s2">convincing</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.740" end="00:15:41.059" style="s2">instead of more equity in debt financing</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.040" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">that decide to you know use this or get</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.800" end="00:19:23.580" style="s2">a leg up on whatever they&#39;re doing but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:26.010" style="s2">then you really said that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.580" end="00:19:29.340" style="s2">point where like if you do open-source</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.010" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">this and you do give even you know even</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.340" end="00:19:33.330" style="s2">like people who aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.800" style="s2">direct competitors but if this</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.330" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">information is out there in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.800" end="00:19:39.210" style="s2">then everyone already has a plus-one to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">having this information we just like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.210" end="00:19:43.920" style="s2">help you know and also like if if a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:45.420" style="s2">competitor comes along and builds a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.920" end="00:19:46.950" style="s2">better hardware system that&#39;s gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.420" end="00:19:48.660" style="s2">this system but it will then you better</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.950" end="00:19:51.030" style="s2">work your ass off to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.660" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case and that your system</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.030" end="00:19:55.740" style="s2">is always promising you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:57.390" style="s2">better experience for users so</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.740" end="00:19:59.130" style="s2">definitely for me initially it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.390" end="00:20:01.530" style="s2">of like a jolt of a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.130" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s cool so you said you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.530" end="00:20:04.470" style="s2">came in and you didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:05.700" style="s2">operations experience so how did you how</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.470" end="00:20:13.500" style="s2">have you learned it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:15.410" style="s2">I mean on the job yeah yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.500" end="00:20:16.740" style="s2">the thing I quickly realized was that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.410" end="00:20:18.690" style="s2">operations</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.740" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t want glory in operations you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.690" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2">want to be like as behind-the-scenes as</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.660" style="s2">possible because it means the company&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">being run and people aren&#39;t realizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.660" end="00:20:28.610" style="s2">that something&#39;s an issue if that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:32.610" style="s2">know you don&#39;t want there to be issues</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.610" end="00:20:34.530" style="s2">which was a very interesting just just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">different approach of like okay how do I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.530" end="00:20:39.150" style="s2">you know how do I go about this how do i</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">how do I make sure that the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.150" end="00:20:45.000" style="s2">are happening are happening in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:48.930" style="s2">that that people don&#39;t like people can</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.000" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">do their job and thankfully like comma</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.930" end="00:20:52.520" style="s2">grew with me</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:55.230" style="s2">you know comma when I joined comma was I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.520" end="00:20:57.090" style="s2">think we had ten or eleven people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.230" end="00:20:58.710" style="s2">because we had interns and those interns</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.090" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">left so we were like down to six at one</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.710" end="00:21:02.760" style="s2">point so six person company if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.500" style="s2">never done operations before you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.760" end="00:21:07.290" style="s2">learn and you can like manage quickly</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.500" end="00:21:09.630" style="s2">and because common has scaled that like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.290" end="00:21:12.420" style="s2">a very I think like appropriate rate</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.630" end="00:21:16.770" style="s2">it&#39;s been a good a good way of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.420" end="00:21:18.450" style="s2">learning and yeah I mean when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.770" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">San Francisco every other person does</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.450" end="00:21:24.600" style="s2">operations to some extent right</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:25.650" style="s2">Moses yeah how about attracting talent I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.600" end="00:21:27.750" style="s2">mean the Bay Area&#39;s got to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.650" end="00:21:29.790" style="s2">most competitive areas for tech talent</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.750" end="00:21:31.380" style="s2">for sure and for even for the Ontario</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.790" end="00:21:34.350" style="s2">students so how are you attracting</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.380" end="00:21:35.610" style="s2">talent yeah so this was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.350" end="00:21:38.040" style="s2">and and one of the reasons we actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.610" end="00:21:39.000" style="s2">moved to San Diego oh right yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.040" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2">in San Diego now too</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.000" end="00:21:46.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve done San Diego yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2">initially I mean working at comma is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.160" end="00:21:50.910" style="s2">different than working at almost any</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:52.260" style="s2">other company so already with just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.910" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">the open source factor you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.260" end="00:21:54.930" style="s2">attract people that are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.580" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">the open source community and that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.930" end="00:22:00.090" style="s2">key so like number one way for us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:02.220" style="s2">attract count talent was like through</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.090" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">get up pouring over people&#39;s kid hopes</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.220" end="00:22:05.040" style="s2">making sure that you know like people</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.020" style="s2">were already contributing to the open</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.040" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">source community people who are excited</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.020" end="00:22:12.180" style="s2">about those projects are gonna be really</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:14.460" style="s2">excited about you know open sourced your</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.180" end="00:22:18.900" style="s2">consistent system so that was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.460" end="00:22:19.380" style="s2">helpful way also I think that so yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.900" end="00:22:21.180" style="s2">is real</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.380" end="00:22:23.190" style="s2">hard to you know when Google&#39;s gonna pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.180" end="00:22:24.570" style="s2">a machine learning engineer hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.190" end="00:22:26.280" style="s2">thousands of dollars and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">to keep your startup very lean and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:30.630" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna offer that what you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:31.980" style="s2">on the flip side though is people that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.630" end="00:22:33.270" style="s2">are in it because they really do believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.980" end="00:22:36.810" style="s2">that this company is going to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.270" end="00:22:39.660" style="s2">which is always the goal and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.810" end="00:22:42.540" style="s2">you people who come in and take you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.660" end="00:22:44.070" style="s2">you give a sliding scale of equity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.540" end="00:22:46.140" style="s2">salary and people who take like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:48.150" style="s2">is the slowest salary and the highest</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.140" end="00:22:50.100" style="s2">equity because always like a positive</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.150" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">you know reinforcement of where this</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.100" end="00:22:53.940" style="s2">person thinks the company is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">moving to San Diego</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.940" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">so it was hard it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously super</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:01.710" style="s2">hard to recruit it&#39;s obviously very hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:03.750" style="s2">to attract talent and going to San Diego</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.710" end="00:23:05.190" style="s2">one of the ideas was like okay maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.750" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to attract talent more</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.190" end="00:23:10.530" style="s2">easily qual comes here you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:11.880" style="s2">will be different than the thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.530" end="00:23:14.930" style="s2">startups in the Bay Area that are all</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.880" end="00:23:21.210" style="s2">trying to attract the same people that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.930" end="00:23:23.550" style="s2">played out so I Monica Lee we a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.210" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">our employees not a lot but a decent</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.550" end="00:23:29.190" style="s2">amount now have come from our community</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:31.770" style="s2">and so that&#39;s proven to be like more and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.190" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">more the best way to get people is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.770" end="00:23:35.070" style="s2">people that are that find themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.720" end="00:23:36.840" style="s2">the common community are already</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.070" end="00:23:39.450" style="s2">interested and then if they you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.840" end="00:23:41.340" style="s2">contributed really positively floating</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.450" end="00:23:45.810" style="s2">the idea of joining a company it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.340" end="00:23:48.150" style="s2">an exciting next step so and also just</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.810" end="00:23:49.860" style="s2">kind of realizing that San Diego is also</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.150" end="00:23:52.980" style="s2">a more pleasant place to live I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.860" end="00:23:55.110" style="s2">then the Bay Area barry smith says he</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:57.300" style="s2">was amazing yes you news great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.110" end="00:23:58.950" style="s2">easier to attract people from you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.300" end="00:24:00.930" style="s2">wherever in the u.s. to move to San</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.950" end="00:24:02.010" style="s2">Diego than to move to San Francisco well</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.930" end="00:24:04.290" style="s2">in San Diego&#39;s got a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.010" end="00:24:06.930" style="s2">technology sector as well a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.290" end="00:24:08.850" style="s2">entrepreneurial sector there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.930" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">biotech but you know also that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.850" end="00:24:12.600" style="s2">helps because then we&#39;re we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.620" end="00:24:15.000" style="s2">biotech so we&#39;re different yeah I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.600" end="00:24:16.050" style="s2">a bunch of my for I&#39;ve coached a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.000" end="00:24:17.160" style="s2">companies and I&#39;ve got a number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.050" end="00:24:18.360" style="s2">different coaching clients that are in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.160" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">San Diego and then a couple of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.360" end="00:24:22.950" style="s2">members of our CEO or Alliance are in</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:26.280" style="s2">San Diego as well it&#39;s just it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.950" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">great market so what are you guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.280" end="00:24:29.810" style="s2">struggling with right now what are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:29.810" style="s2">pain points</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.350" end="00:24:37.660" style="s2">I think the main pain point is like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.590" end="00:24:40.030" style="s2">what do you want your company to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.660" end="00:24:43.420" style="s2">like you know we built this company and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.030" end="00:24:45.310" style="s2">you were you you&#39;re working towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.420" end="00:24:47.500" style="s2">profitability so this is the old this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.310" end="00:24:50.500" style="s2">for now the ultimate goal you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.500" end="00:24:53.140" style="s2">in the immediate future but what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.500" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">a company do you scale into what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.140" end="00:24:58.270" style="s2">company do you become how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:25:00.220" style="s2">decentralize the responsibilities of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.270" end="00:25:02.170" style="s2">company so you don&#39;t have like one</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.220" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">single point of failure being your CEO</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.170" end="00:25:08.620" style="s2">or whatever how do you you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:10.150" style="s2">you work on I guess at the core of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.620" end="00:25:12.670" style="s2">like it&#39;s our product in the company we</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.150" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">talk about a lot stability so stability</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.670" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">on the product and stability in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:19.030" style="s2">company and how do you build something</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:22.270" style="s2">that will outlast everyone that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.030" end="00:25:24.930" style="s2">currently at this company you know those</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.270" end="00:25:26.950" style="s2">kind of thoughts that you have when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.930" end="00:25:28.450" style="s2">yeah if you&#39;re profitable you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">self-sustained for hopefully a very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.450" end="00:25:31.500" style="s2">long time and then what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.500" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">how are you kind of giving the vision to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">your team right now how are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.240" style="s2">articulating it or getting them aligned</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:42.280" style="s2">and inspired and then how do you also</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.240" end="00:25:44.280" style="s2">keep a group of people super excited</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.280" end="00:25:47.170" style="s2">when they&#39;re coming on for equity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.280" end="00:25:49.330" style="s2">the company&#39;s seemingly moving towards a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.170" end="00:25:52.600" style="s2">profitability focus does that distract</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.330" end="00:25:54.220" style="s2">them at all I mean in and by all rights</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.600" end="00:25:56.650" style="s2">they should be focused on profitability</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.220" end="00:26:00.160" style="s2">anyway but if it&#39;s builder busts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.650" end="00:26:03.190" style="s2">a different goal so how do you keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.160" end="00:26:06.310" style="s2">people incentive is an interesting less</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.190" end="00:26:09.370" style="s2">incentive eyes and more a more aligned</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.310" end="00:26:12.700" style="s2">more aligned and inspired you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.370" end="00:26:16.180" style="s2">the vision yeah they&#39;re not just trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.700" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">to focus on an exit I think what helps</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.180" end="00:26:22.060" style="s2">is having an actual user base so we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:23.770" style="s2">like a community discord and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.060" end="00:26:25.030" style="s2">our users are on that discord and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.770" end="00:26:27.850" style="s2">of our employees are on that discord</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.030" end="00:26:30.040" style="s2">talking fusers you know like having beta</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.850" end="00:26:32.200" style="s2">programs and stuff like that that house</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.040" end="00:26:34.540" style="s2">because you literally see what you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.200" end="00:26:38.200" style="s2">doing affecting people that you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.540" end="00:26:41.170" style="s2">talking being a 13-person company what</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:43.330" style="s2">you work on has a big impact you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.170" end="00:26:45.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not working on like a product</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.330" end="00:26:47.140" style="s2">project with IP</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.040" end="00:26:49.480" style="s2">bounine have that be scrapped like if</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.140" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t do something it&#39;s obvious and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.480" end="00:26:55.150" style="s2">it hurts you know it hurts the company</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">so I think that alignment like will come</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.150" end="00:27:00.610" style="s2">naturally just people seeing you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">what their work has and then in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.610" end="00:27:06.910" style="s2">like the profitability equity think I</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:09.280" style="s2">don&#39;t even think it&#39;s directly related</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.910" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">to comma when people hear that I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.280" end="00:27:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a realization of like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">state of feces in the state of San</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.170" end="00:27:18.070" style="s2">Francisco Silicon Valley or like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">money will dry up the money that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.070" end="00:27:21.730" style="s2">just handing out to companies will dry</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:23.230" style="s2">up so if you do want to succeed if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.730" end="00:27:26.170" style="s2">do want to win at self-driving cars and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.230" end="00:27:28.420" style="s2">solve self-driving cars what better way</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.170" end="00:27:32.020" style="s2">than to create a profitable company that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.420" end="00:27:34.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t die on these investors and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.020" end="00:27:37.240" style="s2">think that mindset just helps in general</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.510" end="00:27:40.360" style="s2">you know people get on board with with</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.240" end="00:27:41.560" style="s2">yeah putting profit first can you and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.360" end="00:27:43.180" style="s2">know that you&#39;re still privately held</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.560" end="00:27:45.040" style="s2">and still see drowned can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.180" end="00:27:47.320" style="s2">disclose some numbers to us in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.040" end="00:27:51.460" style="s2">users and revenue numbers at all or did</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.320" end="00:27:55.870" style="s2">you to keep that stuff private still so</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:28:00.580" style="s2">we had I think was around 160 grand in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.870" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">revenue um and you know we spend at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:10.180" style="s2">rate of about you know about probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:13.300" style="s2">180 grand a month is our burn rate so</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:23.170" style="s2">which would be great and ideally we</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.670" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">don&#39;t need to raise money again you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.170" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">ideally we are profitable early next</p>
