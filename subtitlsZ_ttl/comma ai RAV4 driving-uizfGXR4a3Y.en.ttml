<p begin="00:21:43.170" end="00:21:47.490" style="s2">changing oh yeah yeah you can do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.720" end="00:21:51.750" style="s2">that&#39;s always been you can do half my</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.490" end="00:21:53.430" style="s2">judge oh so what if you just get into</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.750" end="00:21:55.770" style="s2">the lane it already center itself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.430" end="00:21:58.580" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there&#39;s like just push it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:22:02.269" style="s2">over here and I&#39;ll let go</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.580" end="00:22:03.860" style="s2">whoo yeah that&#39;s a partial lane change I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.269" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s what what Tesla does</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.860" end="00:22:07.490" style="s2">right now right so no Tesla you actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:11.289" style="s2">turned the blinker on an auto lane</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.490" end="00:22:11.289" style="s2">changes but that doesn&#39;t work I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.620" end="00:22:15.230" style="s2">without without turning the wheel at</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.880" end="00:22:17.570" style="s2">work point but there&#39;s a few major</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.230" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">problems with Tesla&#39;s doing first off</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.570" end="00:22:20.809" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to side radars they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:22.669" style="s2">using ultrasonics don&#39;t use ultrasonic</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.809" end="00:22:29.870" style="s2">sprawl ultrasonics are terrible</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.669" end="00:22:31.490" style="s2">um the other problem yeah like I get</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.870" end="00:22:35.240" style="s2">sketched out in places like that the car</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.490" end="00:22:36.470" style="s2">drove totally flies I know I well the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.240" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">thing is honestly I&#39;m not afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.470" end="00:22:41.690" style="s2">car goes we&#39;re all afraid of the guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:44.330" style="s2">yeah maybe that&#39;s the beach threat with</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.690" end="00:22:46.070" style="s2">driving a car is a bullying look at like</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.330" end="00:22:48.139" style="s2">I&#39;m like why are we slowing down so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.070" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">because you have that look that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.139" end="00:22:53.330" style="s2">slowing down right you don&#39;t see it the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:53.870" style="s2">radar is superhuman oh that truck is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.330" end="00:22:55.789" style="s2">slowing down</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.870" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">yeah yeah right that trucks going mad</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.789" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">slow takeover</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:04.639" style="s2">we&#39;ll see so yeah we when we tracked his</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:06.470" style="s2">engagements we track what was done for</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.639" end="00:23:08.899" style="s2">the disengagement so there&#39;s four kinds</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.470" end="00:23:11.680" style="s2">of disengagement right there&#39;s gas brake</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.899" end="00:23:14.710" style="s2">steering and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.680" end="00:23:17.930" style="s2">so dis engagements with the gas are</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.710" end="00:23:19.370" style="s2">considered not safe differently because</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.930" end="00:23:20.930" style="s2">in general if you want to give it more</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.370" end="00:23:22.490" style="s2">gas than open I was giving it it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.930" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">probably wasn&#39;t doing something unsafe</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.490" end="00:23:26.900" style="s2">that probably just was pissing me walk</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:28.850" style="s2">yes brake disengagement SAR the worst</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.900" end="00:23:30.500" style="s2">ones yes you&#39;re just engaged with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.850" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">brake okay that means something went</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.500" end="00:23:33.170" style="s2">wrong does that mean something went</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:34.730" style="s2">wrong and steering dis engagements are</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.170" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">not great either particularly sharp</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.730" end="00:23:41.540" style="s2">steering disappearance so we pay most</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:43.400" style="s2">attention to those but ya know 2018 is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.540" end="00:23:44.930" style="s2">just gonna be a race to drive down this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.400" end="00:23:48.380" style="s2">engagement ride over again last and last</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.930" end="00:23:50.420" style="s2">and less and less until they were so few</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.380" end="00:23:53.060" style="s2">and our hardware is so reliable that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.420" end="00:23:54.950" style="s2">can make it level 3 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.060" end="00:23:58.250" style="s2">wait when do the levels change I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.950" end="00:24:00.140" style="s2">noticed this no you&#39;re like five and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.250" end="00:24:01.670" style="s2"> yeah yeah yeah no like when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.140" end="00:24:02.990" style="s2">like first started , it was what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.670" end="00:24:04.370" style="s2">were level three you need it to get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.990" end="00:24:05.900" style="s2">level four right and now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.370" end="00:24:07.910" style="s2">you&#39;re level two and you did level three</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:10.220" style="s2">the the levels change what is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.910" end="00:24:11.960" style="s2">last two numbers in it really changed it</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.220" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">just kind of became legally advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.960" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">to always only calling yourself level 2</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:17.810" style="s2">okay how much curious because that was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:19.550" style="s2">level 5</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.810" end="00:24:20.930" style="s2">right well I lost little five was always</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.550" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">level four which is fully its bullet</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.930" end="00:24:27.080" style="s2">okay so the distinction between five and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">four is four means it&#39;s fully autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.080" end="00:24:34.540" style="s2">on certain routes five means it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:34.540" style="s2">autonomous everywhere cars control</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.620" end="00:24:39.090" style="s2">yes so you can have a level four car but</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.620" end="00:24:43.460" style="s2">it&#39;s just limited in the places it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.090" end="00:24:46.290" style="s2">take you a level five or my particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.460" end="00:24:48.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the distinction so someone wants</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.290" end="00:24:51.090" style="s2">to know if you removed the the message</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.450" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">telling you to regain the wheel in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.090" end="00:24:57.780" style="s2">car no no I don&#39;t know if they just saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:58.620" style="s2">it and they said yeah absolutely not and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.780" end="00:25:01.020" style="s2">don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.620" end="00:25:03.059" style="s2">don&#39;t remove the message that&#39;s bad yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.020" end="00:25:04.860" style="s2">six minute timeout is still absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.059" end="00:25:06.690" style="s2">functional we don&#39;t take it out it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.860" end="00:25:08.340" style="s2">good safety feature Oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.690" end="00:25:10.530" style="s2">as far as the one that talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.340" end="00:25:12.300" style="s2">torque limit I mean then comes up much</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.530" end="00:25:13.230" style="s2">less likely on the Toyota the Honda</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.300" end="00:25:16.050" style="s2">because the Toyota has much higher</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.230" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">torque the one that says like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.050" end="00:25:20.760" style="s2">sorry that turns to sharp yeah turns are</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:22.910" style="s2">just way more likely to be too sharp on</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.760" end="00:25:22.910" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.490" end="00:25:35.690" style="s2">what are we kind of nice I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.710" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">driven a lion to eat is over by like</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.690" end="00:25:40.780" style="s2">that&#39;s right I got pulled over once</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">those bottles for doing wanna speeding</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.780" end="00:25:47.060" style="s2">95 that&#39;s bad to know in 74 we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:48.440" style="s2">no like when it flashes Ward and demands</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.060" end="00:25:51.050" style="s2">you to hold the wheel every 20-30</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.440" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">seconds yes we&#39;re talking about no it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.050" end="00:25:54.890" style="s2">was never removed and it&#39;s not open I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:56.030" style="s2">never demanded that you hold the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.890" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">over 20 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.030" end="00:25:59.420" style="s2">no it demands every six minutes that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">touch the wheel to prove that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.420" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">still there yeah exactly those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">are not those things are not good like</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:10.340" style="s2">like so there&#39;s a difference between an</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.820" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">actual safety and liability right so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.340" end="00:26:14.360" style="s2">think about that thing we&#39;re like Toyota</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.010" style="s2">will like disengage at 20 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.360" end="00:26:17.870" style="s2">and just like let you slam into the car</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.010" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">in front of you right yeah that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.870" end="00:26:21.620" style="s2">was done for liability reasons if not</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:23.750" style="s2">for safety reasons yes and if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.620" end="00:26:27.020" style="s2">distinction I will always favor actual</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.750" end="00:26:28.730" style="s2">safety over liability Lagos just which</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.020" end="00:26:30.860" style="s2">manufacturers is this neon currently</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.730" end="00:26:33.140" style="s2">compatible with what cars are so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.860" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">remember that the EON is a dashcam you</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.140" end="00:26:36.800" style="s2">have to modify it if you want to work as</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.830" style="s2">a self-driving unit the Aeons we sell</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.550" end="00:27:26.270" style="s2">hot as a Toyotas and that girl no okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:28.810" style="s2">right the same car Lexus and Toyota is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.270" end="00:27:28.810" style="s2">in the same car</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.299" end="00:27:36.520" style="s2">we&#39;re in the middle lower you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.090" end="00:27:38.710" style="s2">better off buying a high trim of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.520" end="00:27:41.080" style="s2">cheaper brand and a low trim of the more</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.710" end="00:27:44.110" style="s2">expensive grant a lot of people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.360" end="00:27:52.659" style="s2">reset the thing so masters I like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:54.400" style="s2">have a Honda Civic touring and we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.659" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">like a base-model dialect the Honda</p>
