<p begin="00:03:49.800" end="00:03:53.270" style="s2">And we&#39;re gonna have to deal with the fact that oh man let&#39;s go</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:51.439" style="s2">We&#39;ll pass in the actual pose to process frame that&#39;s a little day</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.969" end="00:05:56.969" style="s2">Hello</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:02.549" style="s2">It&#39;s probably like a one-liner to read this. Yeah, we have work to do get their</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.259" end="00:07:31.079" style="s2">Map object. No, I want to run math. I was just some Python 3 bullshit that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.020" end="00:07:40.559" style="s2">This is too like lazy evaluation or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.599" end="00:07:50.039" style="s2">Just did - 3 lazily evaluate maths or something I</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.399" end="00:07:59.399" style="s2">Filtered that oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.899" end="00:08:08.819" style="s2">Very cool now, I can India way that we got to do work before we do work. You know, it&#39;s like pre-gaming</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.750" end="00:08:48.169" style="s2">Okay, so those are the quick turning ons</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.459" end="00:08:56.299" style="s2">Now we&#39;re going to need to write some code to go from quaternions to matrices</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.350" end="00:09:06.350" style="s2">Yeah, let&#39;s do that</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">So quick turn on is another way to</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.570" end="00:10:24.089" style="s2">This looks pretty good. There we go. Perfect just copy out. What&#39;s the license on us?</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">There&#39;s a license</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.620" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">It&#39;s kind of that&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:19.140" style="s2">Don&#39;t I outer that&#39;s interesting</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.270" style="s2">Went and this is doing to watch man</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:56.789" style="s2">Your eyes gonna vectorize this I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:21.390" style="s2">It right</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:40.210" style="s2">Okay, well seems to do nothing the Nikes vectorize correctly</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.890" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">It seems like it works</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.890" end="00:14:25.239" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s just write the stupid way for the hell and then maybe somebody can fix this later on a pull request</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.750" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">Well, we all right cool</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:01.399" style="s2">Right, it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.129" end="00:15:11.928" style="s2">See what I just wrote I should feel ashamed or whatever. Oh it was terrible</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.129" end="00:15:27.979" style="s2">Okay, cool now that works I don&#39;t know why vectorize doesn&#39;t work somebody who actually liked those things can probably make that work</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.459" end="00:15:35.479" style="s2">But that&#39;s some ugly-ass Co right there so, you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.889" end="00:15:40.849" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about the language, you know the kind of language. Is that like?</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:47.659" style="s2">And pose Artie is also not a vectorized thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.949" end="00:16:09.579" style="s2">Well do it 9000</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.329" end="00:17:06.129" style="s2">It&#39;s in call and in parentheses, oh, wow clearly, it&#39;s important that I do this</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.799" end="00:17:11.799" style="s2">Where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.380" end="00:17:21.459" style="s2">Okay, so few things</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.710" end="00:17:30.710" style="s2">Think what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:33.080" style="s2">Is say MP</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.330" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">went out in GT o sub 0</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:39.950" style="s2">P</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.420" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">Mo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.690" end="00:17:57.289" style="s2">Work work maybe. Yeah looks pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:03.199" style="s2">Cool so theoretically those should be poses</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.290" end="00:18:10.399" style="s2">Think is like I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s actually correct with the rotations</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.300" end="00:18:14.300" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure like</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.310" end="00:18:20.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been kind of confused about which is applied. First is the rotation applied first or is the translation apply first</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.390" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">This looks wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.400" end="00:18:26.300" style="s2">Let&#39;s let&#39;s look in the actual ground truth. See what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.680" end="00:18:31.249" style="s2">We know that the first thing it does is moves on the z axis</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.390" end="00:18:35.390" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:41.450" style="s2">Yeah, that looks like it&#39;s just pretty much moving on the Z why is that showing a bit of movement on the Y</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.930" end="00:18:44.930" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t seem right</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.090" end="00:18:54.529" style="s2">So therefore what we might want to do is you don&#39;t want to uh, apply the rotation separately we want to do it like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">Right back on what we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:28.050" style="s2">So it is the other way then we&#39;re just gonna be yes, I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.210" end="00:19:51.239" style="s2">Mean that&#39;s so moving a lot on the x-axis, but at least it&#39;s not moving on the y-axis</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.820" end="00:19:59.820" style="s2">Try this</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.010" end="00:20:07.560" style="s2">It&#39;s still moving on the x-axis take a look so these are the that movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:12.180" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s really when you look at it actually slam</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.690" end="00:20:37.979" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna have actually slam it looks like it only moves on that access</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.530" end="00:20:43.349" style="s2">So let&#39;s try this. Maybe we have to uh, apply the rotation from the translation</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">Well, try that first see like the order matters, right</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.740" end="00:20:59.910" style="s2">Shapes are not aligned for all align my shapes brow</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.940" end="00:21:05.940" style="s2">Closed transpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.660" end="00:21:13.529" style="s2">There we go, all right now it&#39;s moving in the y-axis this is worse</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2">Like I don&#39;t know what to do, right</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">By that first</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.660" end="00:21:29.609" style="s2">And we would expect movement really only on the z-axis so that&#39;s identical</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:35.879" style="s2">Which that doesn&#39;t seem like it should be like that at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">That&#39;s identical to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.410" end="00:21:57.479" style="s2">Different from this we don&#39;t undertake the translation, but you see how this is like messed up like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:04.709" style="s2">Hashtag Andy. Hi Bros. It&#39;s bad boy</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:20.519" style="s2">My first time frames it just comes forward in the Z location I might be wrong about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:25.350" style="s2">Pose</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.780" end="00:22:42.780" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.240" end="00:22:53.909" style="s2">There&#39;s the pose yeah, so notice how we&#39;re moving almost exclusively in the z axis</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.670" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">Remember everything about this is up to slam</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.130" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">It&#39;s up to scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.190" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">It says we&#39;re moving forward in the z axis, which is actually wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.030" end="00:23:13.950" style="s2">And that&#39;s because what we really want to do is you want to invert the policy</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:30.139" style="s2">But yeah, so it&#39;s moving almost exclusively the z-axis so in order whatever this ground truth is it better be exclusively easy</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.220" end="00:23:36.110" style="s2">All right Burke XYZ, I got the right thing that&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.420" end="00:23:44.180" style="s2">Three the website there, there&#39;s some information about it. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:56.569" style="s2">How did they get the ground truth where does the ground truth come from wait does grant trees come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.790" end="00:24:01.790" style="s2">More info</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.980" end="00:24:07.579" style="s2">The Kinect was pointed typical. It&#39;s a Kinect the sequence contains only translational motion</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.100" end="00:24:11.269" style="s2">As it is very simple ground truth the trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.270" end="00:24:14.270" style="s2">So that&#39;s what we did</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.470" end="00:24:21.470" style="s2">Yeah, here we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.830" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">So clearly we have to rotate it back</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.470" end="00:24:39.289" style="s2">Like let&#39;s just play with the rotation first to get back to the track, I&#39;m sorry the translation first, let&#39;s get that to be correct</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.040" end="00:24:44.029" style="s2">We should be able to do this without dealing with the rotation</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:47.960" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s clearly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.950" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">You can even like sample</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.560" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">It is moving along this axis, but there&#39;s first off there&#39;s a huge offset</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.590" end="00:25:04.669" style="s2">You&#39;re coding up AI to save me bro, I think what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:17.419" style="s2">It&#39;s not right? Okay. What if we switch the order of those does that matter? How does that not matter?</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">Like it&#39;s literally the same but how does it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.520" end="00:25:32.139" style="s2">I&#39;m still printing the shape of something stupid aren&#39;t I? Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.710" end="00:25:38.710" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.370" end="00:25:42.370" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.410" end="00:25:48.489" style="s2">Think I see the problem this is XY and Z and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.400" end="00:25:57.190" style="s2">The movement according to my experiments should be almost exclusively in the z axis. It&#39;s not I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.480" end="00:26:04.810" style="s2">Didn&#39;t like read it wrong right Dax to ITV and I did from zero to full our that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.420" end="00:26:09.070" style="s2">They did from full onward and that&#39;s the quick turn IANA</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:11.740" style="s2">rotation</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.540" end="00:26:15.540" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.730" end="00:26:19.660" style="s2">But this is wrong or oh, I know it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.450" end="00:26:23.169" style="s2">Well, maybe you don&#39;t actually want to invert this</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.870" end="00:26:26.770" style="s2">Maybe like they encode it weird like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:39.339" style="s2">Okay, well that&#39;s showing no motion in the z-axis, which is interesting because it&#39;s the only place that we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.670" end="00:26:47.670" style="s2">That&#39;s worse great</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.600" end="00:26:56.819" style="s2">See if they talk more about like how the pose is oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.700" end="00:27:02.850" style="s2">Let&#39;s check them right intrinsic promise, correct</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s like half is fine</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.750" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">That&#39;s normalizing this stuff, ah, here we go</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.850" end="00:27:32.850" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.330" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">Gives the position of the optical center of the color camera with respect to the world origin as defined by the I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.320" end="00:27:53.939" style="s2">Got a so Leopold&#39;s mechanical. I know this is what a lot of livestream coding devolves into</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.580" end="00:27:58.439" style="s2">It devolves into kind of bullshit where people talk about like key boys and set up some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:05.129" style="s2">Okay, well first off, let&#39;s are the timestamps vaguely sorted</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.730" end="00:28:08.849" style="s2">So I can make sure I&#39;m not doing anything stupid back</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">If they&#39;re very sorta</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.560" end="00:28:13.330" style="s2">gives the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.330" end="00:28:16.919" style="s2">orientation of the optical center of the color camera in form of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.380" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">Unit quaternion on with respect to the world origin as defined by the motion capture system</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.630" end="00:28:25.650" style="s2">Okay, so I think we&#39;re first gonna want to rotate the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.890" end="00:28:32.489" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna want to uh, apply this rotation</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.460" end="00:28:42.579" style="s2">Wait, this isn&#39;t necessarily correct</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.150" end="00:28:55.030" style="s2">Orientation with respect to the motion capture system</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.860" end="00:29:02.500" style="s2">So we want to move everything into the orientation of the camera</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:10.450" style="s2">This stuff is really hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.930" end="00:29:21.029" style="s2">Okay, so here here&#39;s this time of motion capture system, here&#39;s the camera facing this way right</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.090" end="00:29:24.090" style="s2">so what we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.910" end="00:29:28.440" style="s2">Move things into the perspective of the camera. How do we do it?</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.310" end="00:29:32.429" style="s2">Basically this is the new origin</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.380" end="00:29:37.859" style="s2">So we can certainly subtract that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.240" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2">Noir here, but we&#39;re still rotated like this. So now I think we rotate</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:54.840" style="s2">That isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.590" end="00:30:21.300" style="s2">No, okay, we shouldn&#39;t just be trying things I&#39;m so bad about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.320" end="00:30:25.320" style="s2">My mammals aren&#39;t wrong, right</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.800" end="00:30:29.669" style="s2">GG r equals quarter neon matrix. Yeah, it&#39;s fun. I</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.940" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">Don&#39;t like typos this right?</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:53.990" style="s2">Wait a second, is that even a rotation matrix? That&#39;s a weird-ass rotation matrix?</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.030" end="00:31:00.229" style="s2">That function broken I really hope that functions are not broken</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.030" end="00:31:14.179" style="s2">MP dot t-- q q x MP square, let&#39;s just double check that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.650" end="00:31:22.009" style="s2">Like turning on to rotation matrix, yeah, I&#39;m aware I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.020" end="00:31:27.169" style="s2">Well, you show me a better way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.140" end="00:31:34.219" style="s2">Once I know the answer it might be helpful, but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.690" end="00:31:43.309" style="s2">Okay, two</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.070" end="00:32:07.070" style="s2">Units</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.890" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">Multiply that shit I</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.530" end="00:32:21.109" style="s2">Don&#39;t know there&#39;s a way to check or something as a valid rotation so we could do a 3d on that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.020" end="00:32:30.739" style="s2">Yeah, okay, so I&#39;m trying oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:35.119" style="s2">Okay, so the middles are one so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.419" end="00:32:39.619" style="s2">these these these eigenvalues are one so if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.840" end="00:32:44.840" style="s2">X okay, so that seems okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.960" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">So here&#39;s the here&#39;s the cent here&#39;s the here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:53.329" style="s2">Camera, and here&#39;s like two poses, right?</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.190" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">So here&#39;s pose of campus zero here&#39;s post camera, so we want to rotate everything into this coordinate frame</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.510" end="00:33:16.729" style="s2">This rotation is defined with respect to yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.270" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">It looks like they all change</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">So that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:34:00.139" style="s2">So if I subtract that out it&#39;s like I&#39;m moving this to here</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.210" end="00:34:05.210" style="s2">Now when I go like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.590" end="00:34:09.949" style="s2">Just want to apply the rotation right I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">Tried that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.700" end="00:34:22.700" style="s2">That&#39;s not correct</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.080" end="00:34:29.749" style="s2">Let&#39;s take a look at their script they have some evaluation scripture here. That&#39;ll teach me something</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.790" end="00:34:38.629" style="s2">That are automatic evaluation - let&#39;s see what they have to evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.290" end="00:34:53.290" style="s2">Comparison we offer a setup</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.819" end="00:34:59.889" style="s2">Evaluate absolute trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.150" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">Align it using the time stamps. Oh, are we not</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.260" end="00:35:16.089" style="s2">For these time stamps, not at all matching the camera time stamps. Is that the problem?</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.030" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">Because this just sampled in a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.319" end="00:35:26.379" style="s2">Because I threw a lot of stuff away</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.290" end="00:35:32.559" style="s2">They sort of explain everything but oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:45.220" style="s2">Yeah, these are just totally in the wrong time basis, oh wait these don&#39;t even line up at all. Oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.520" end="00:35:54.520" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:35:59.980" style="s2">Yeah, okay fine. Oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.309" end="00:36:03.309" style="s2">That&#39;s annoying</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.740" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">Okay Wow</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.339" end="00:36:09.339" style="s2">You see the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.599" end="00:36:17.679" style="s2">Like these time stamps are just unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.799" end="00:36:35.718" style="s2">Ah stupid stupid stupid stupid it&#39;s stupid</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.539" end="00:37:20.089" style="s2">Yeah, so if you guys saw on the other stream I encoded these things in like videos so they were reasonable to work with</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.729" end="00:37:22.729" style="s2">But that threw away</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.059" end="00:37:26.059" style="s2">The timing information</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.420" end="00:37:33.439" style="s2">So they actually started the capture before they started the video. I got you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.229" end="00:37:44.688" style="s2">Knew they were trying to scam me bro. Trying to scam me this free dataset was trying to scam</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.589" end="00:37:49.278" style="s2">That&#39;s why we should have paid IDM for a data set</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.009" end="00:37:52.009" style="s2">The data set we paid for</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.709" end="00:37:59.389" style="s2">Amazing kitty I&#39;m using Fryeburg. I&#39;m sure if we had paid IBM for a data set. It would have been the highest quality data set</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.179" end="00:38:05.179" style="s2">That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.489" end="00:38:10.489" style="s2">That&#39;s not floats</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.510" end="00:38:18.510" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.890" end="00:39:10.930" style="s2">Gotta get your parsing of good man. You learn this shit and CTFs real fast</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.410" end="00:39:23.020" style="s2">All right now now let&#39;s see what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.790" end="00:39:28.840" style="s2">Okay now welcome to another stupid thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.110" end="00:39:32.110" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.120" end="00:39:37.870" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna run into a problem because you can&#39;t interpolate quaternions nicely. Oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.830" end="00:39:46.389" style="s2">Wow, I&#39;m not a text that you know what that sounds like that sounds like a Python 3 problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.540" end="00:39:51.879" style="s2">No, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s my fault. Never mind. I&#39;m sorry for blaming Python 3</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:57.490" style="s2">Okay, so we&#39;re gonna want to do NP internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.650" end="00:40:08.410" style="s2">1 dimensional linear interpolation so we don&#39;t want it to be one-dimensional. We want a multi-dimensional CyHi enter</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:16.430" style="s2">See the problem. Well, I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.110" end="00:40:28.819" style="s2">Was gonna play some cardi B, but I&#39;ll totally get a copyright strike for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.870" end="00:40:42.260" style="s2">So we want to say Gigi&#39;s 0g cheese</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.840" end="00:40:47.840" style="s2">Ii of work</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">It&#39;s gonna complain that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.600" end="00:41:01.579" style="s2">Like well you have to do it in order. Otherwise, it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.700" end="00:41:05.720" style="s2">Yeah object to deep for desired or a man</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.620" end="00:41:13.609" style="s2">With deep desire right deep inter these are like helper functions we have it comma</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.460" end="00:41:24.199" style="s2">Let&#39;s look at sigh pi interpolate maybe sci-fi interpret it has a deep interpolate we got a deep interpolate. Oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.790" end="00:41:28.100" style="s2">Oh, wow I could do</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.100" end="00:41:33.170" style="s2">oh, look at all these interpolators Wow, and none of them probably do what I want because it&#39;s I PI o</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.910" end="00:41:42.470" style="s2">Interpolate a 1d function like this is bullshit</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.299" end="00:42:50.278" style="s2">Oh, well, you know we got to make sure that that that&#39;s very important. The Boscombe is very important. Oh great</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.369" end="00:42:57.479" style="s2">Not broadcast arrived. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, how do I want to do this? Someone put a colon here?</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.279" end="00:43:01.690" style="s2">No, right</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.690" end="00:43:05.700" style="s2">Finally, we&#39;re in the right. We&#39;re in the right bullshit. Don&#39;t get the bullshit twister kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.249" end="00:43:11.189" style="s2">Get the bullshit twisted. You&#39;re gonna have a bad time. Let&#39;s call this one GDP in this one GT</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">Gonna have a bad dirt it out stop right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.880" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">Well, well index theories out of bounds of size 300, of course, yeah that makes a lot of sense of tight right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:39.179" style="s2">I love it. Yeah, thank you. Well, thank you for being so you. Oh also Stu one claw solicitor one pasta</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.619" end="00:43:43.619" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.549" end="00:43:47.549" style="s2">Something</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.499" end="00:43:54.179" style="s2">Okay, now let&#39;s just try the first thing we tried that&#39;s probably the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.350" end="00:44:02.350" style="s2">Wasn&#39;t the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.130" end="00:44:07.059" style="s2">Maybe it was and I&#39;m just like going to hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:16.690" style="s2">Times yeah, it&#39;s not the right thing seem kind of right though</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.330" end="00:44:35.470" style="s2">Yeah, I know I&#39;m trying things but like at least like, you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.010" end="00:44:42.010" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.850" end="00:44:54.850" style="s2">Okay, why don&#39;t I think this was better</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.870" end="00:45:01.870" style="s2">Commit a little something</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.900" end="00:45:29.559" style="s2">Okay, but at least that&#39;s fixed now we can think more about other things</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.980" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">Probably what we want to do is we want to do that first. That&#39;s just if we rotated back and we ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.710" end="00:45:58.699" style="s2">That moves it all on the y-axis, which I know is not right</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.770" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">With my interpolation shit, correct, we&#39;re reading that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:05.209" style="s2">We&#39;re like 100</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:12.979" style="s2">To 1 or 2 why did I think this was better?</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.850" end="00:47:19.189" style="s2">It does seem to just move back on this like here it just seems to move on the Z oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:23.150" style="s2">No, it&#39;s actually moving on the X as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.300" end="00:47:29.300" style="s2">Moving on the X as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.910" end="00:47:53.910" style="s2">Hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.000" end="00:48:07.729" style="s2">Yeah, I&#39;m using numpy interrupts the primers only works with a one-dimensional function not a two dimensional function</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.490" end="00:48:12.589" style="s2">Well, there&#39;s plenty more work to do on trips while of course guys who said we&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.099" end="00:48:20.179" style="s2">Well, we&#39;re so today what we&#39;re adding in is we&#39;re adding in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.470" end="00:48:27.470" style="s2">Basically ground truth</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.510" end="00:48:34.249" style="s2">We want to see how each line actually works for the drive tests</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.250" end="00:48:39.709" style="s2">And then we&#39;re gonna stand up a Jenkins shit so we can actually run the tests a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.660" end="00:49:02.660" style="s2">Already wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.660" end="00:49:12.730" style="s2">Okay, so look we&#39;re moving along the z-axis and you can see that right here</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.550" end="00:49:18.039" style="s2">Like the movement along the z-axis is like five times larger the movement along any other access</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.730" end="00:49:26.530" style="s2">You have very small rotations and it moves straight on the z-axis up to like frame 40</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.610" end="00:49:31.059" style="s2">So we should know that all the way to 40</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.690" end="00:49:37.690" style="s2">It&#39;s obviously correct I can see</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.300" end="00:49:47.199" style="s2">But this saying that it&#39;s moving equally as much on the x axis as the z axis, that&#39;s not right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.330" end="00:49:54.699" style="s2">Because we&#39;re still in the rotation frame of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.470" style="s2">Snow/icy I don&#39;t understand I don&#39;t know whether they applied the rotation first or the translation first</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:10.600" style="s2">So probably what we&#39;re going to want to do is we&#39;re gonna wanna maybe we do have to do the applying on a fly thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.270" end="00:50:36.119" style="s2">What you think about remove print from terminal print use a lot of resource</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.000" end="00:50:39.000" style="s2">Well, you put it like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.610" end="00:50:41.610" style="s2">Push it ban print everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.120" end="00:50:52.380" style="s2">Especially in the media banned the media no</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.550" end="00:51:16.529" style="s2">Bro order of translation and relation for matrix interpolation, bro</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.050" end="00:51:25.050" style="s2">Alright</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.970" end="00:51:34.770" style="s2">Let&#39;s check to make sure we don&#39;t do anything student at first of all, it&#39;s print GT</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.270" end="00:51:39.270" style="s2">It should be just be</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.380" end="00:51:49.380" style="s2">Yeah, it seems pretty right</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.300" end="00:51:54.300" style="s2">So these are the translation ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.270" end="00:51:58.379" style="s2">Alright, you know what? I hate. I hate when numpy prints with that kind of shit</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:03.269" style="s2">so let&#39;s just do it&#39;s like numpy dot set print pop and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.640" end="00:52:06.839" style="s2">Suppress equals true and it won&#39;t print in floating-point</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.320" end="00:52:11.039" style="s2">Bullshit anymore. It&#39;ll print it like human readable</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:28.300" style="s2">Something else that I&#39;m not surprised equals true</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.140" end="00:52:40.869" style="s2">No, they see like I don&#39;t want it in floating-point, okay. Well, maybe it&#39;s just maybe I just can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.600" end="00:52:43.779" style="s2">Some of them are too big. Yeah. Okay, I</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.780" end="00:52:46.959" style="s2">Won&#39;t put that up here. Anyways a useful thing to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.390" end="00:52:58.989" style="s2">Okay, so this is the translation these are the quaternions for rotation</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.930" end="00:53:02.860" style="s2">Now there&#39;s a little bit of bullshit, but I don&#39;t think it matters</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.770" end="00:53:06.340" style="s2">We should really renormalize our quarter neon</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.590" end="00:53:14.829" style="s2">So we can do this here and NP now</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.600" end="00:53:23.949" style="s2">It&#39;s not opposed to that cutter neon thing being broken either</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.750" end="00:53:29.830" style="s2">But yeah, so when you do an interpolate on a quaternion</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.430" end="00:53:35.890" style="s2">You have to renormalize it because the sum of a concerning out has to be one</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.010" end="00:53:39.790" style="s2">so let&#39;s just say GT sub or</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:05.569" style="s2">Well, I give zero shits about Google reCAPTCHA, some people really don&#39;t know what a joke is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.059" end="00:54:12.768" style="s2">Whoever followed that and liked that thing really like missed the joke</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.219" end="00:54:23.749" style="s2">Okay, now my cranium is normalize I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.959" end="00:54:27.709" style="s2">Don&#39;t know it&#39;s possible that this doesn&#39;t work. I</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.829" end="00:54:31.458" style="s2">Did check to make sure they were valid rotation matrices</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.989" end="00:54:35.989" style="s2">By doing an s-video</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.359" end="00:54:56.598" style="s2">SC now it&#39;s not a valid rotation matrix</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.599" end="00:55:02.629" style="s2">You can see these eigenvalues or whatever. These things are whatever the middle of SVD is is not ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:05.420" style="s2">So you do need that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.079" end="00:55:09.619" style="s2">So now there was and now I&#39;m happy, okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">It&#39;s still not having</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.970" end="00:55:31.089" style="s2">Here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s the position</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.510" end="00:55:41.949" style="s2">So the rotation as it translates, it&#39;s definitely gonna rotate</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.880" end="00:55:46.510" style="s2">So there is a right way to do this and we just need to think</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.890" end="00:55:50.810" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.810" end="00:55:53.769" style="s2">Let&#39;s even you&#39;re missed you weren&#39;t here for a pull request our oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.650" end="00:55:59.680" style="s2">You don&#39;t I could use like he&#39;s a piece of paper. That would certainly help a bro out. Hey</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.570" end="00:56:09.519" style="s2">Okay, I mean I think we want to apply the rotation first</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.369" end="00:56:15.369" style="s2">Right like here we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.589" end="00:56:21.099" style="s2">Let&#39;s apply the rotations to the rotations</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.750" end="00:56:42.879" style="s2">So now yeah, we&#39;ve applied the rotations to the rotations so we&#39;ve rotated the whole leg, okay. So here here&#39;s that here&#39;s the UM</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.609" end="00:56:45.609" style="s2">here&#39;s the here the the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.770" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">Capture device here&#39;s this and we&#39;ve rotated it all like whoof, right and that&#39;s like whoa, great</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:56.439" style="s2">But now each one of those rotations is</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.770" end="00:57:01.780" style="s2">Like we&#39;ve pointed the first thing correctly now after we do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.260" end="00:57:05.770" style="s2">we can subtract out the translation -</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.829" end="00:57:15.369" style="s2">And then we&#39;ve moved that no no no no we can&#39;t we can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.690" end="00:57:22.810" style="s2">The rotation I believe still depends on the translation, right</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.609" end="00:57:27.639" style="s2">Apply the rotations of the Clifford</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.260" end="00:57:34.260" style="s2">Yeah, I need a needle board</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.130" end="00:57:40.019" style="s2">Okay, so now we&#39;ve applied the rotations to themselves I</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.340" end="00:57:45.989" style="s2">Don&#39;t know if we can subtract I still don&#39;t think we can subtract out the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.080" end="00:57:51.209" style="s2">Like this is probably a really obvious thing if I just like to think a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:58:02.250" style="s2">We&#39;ve applied the rotations to that now we&#39;re gonna have to I think we definitely want to apply the rotations</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.910" end="00:58:11.910" style="s2">Do we</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.390" end="00:58:28.390" style="s2">Yeah, let&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.600" end="00:58:34.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll picture in a paint program</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.140" end="00:58:39.489" style="s2">Okay online paint</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.910" end="00:58:42.910" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">Okay, let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.890" end="00:58:50.510" style="s2">Try online</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.510" end="00:58:58.300" style="s2">No, this is so hard. Oh, I need flash plugin, Oh what j/s paint that it?</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:02.950" style="s2">Dead what what is this? Crap? Google sucks</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.440" end="00:59:08.440" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.620" end="00:59:15.219" style="s2">So here&#39;s the capture device and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.700" end="00:59:23.289" style="s2">Here&#39;s a frame and here&#39;s a frame</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.490" end="00:59:34.630" style="s2">Okay, so the rotation and the translation are with respect to the capture device frame</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.790" end="00:59:39.790" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.980" end="00:59:44.530" style="s2">Let&#39;s let&#39;s this is this is pretty good we&#39;ve got we have I paint an online painting program</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.280" end="00:59:49.030" style="s2">It&#39;s like MS paint, which is exactly what I wanted cool</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.910" end="00:59:57.009" style="s2">So we have to think about how to get this to be in the coordinate frame of the first camera</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">so this is the coordinate frame wherein maybe this was like an arrow pointing this way and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.170" end="01:00:08.499" style="s2">We have to get to this coordinate frame</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.150" end="01:00:14.469" style="s2">So you see how like translation rotation are intertwined right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.450" end="01:00:24.019" style="s2">Let&#39;s think about what we have to do I&#39;m rich that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.060" end="01:00:33.710" style="s2">But I don&#39;t have paper because it&#39;s old we draw another frame over here</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.320" end="01:00:39.320" style="s2">One frame to frame three five</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:56.590" style="s2">Like hmm, okay. You see why the first thing we don&#39;t really want to rotate the world is the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.310" end="01:01:00.310" style="s2">Yeah, I know</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.320" end="01:01:05.110" style="s2">We don&#39;t really want to rotate the world of the first thing because rotating the world will just rotate you around this Center</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.770" end="01:01:12.999" style="s2">Let&#39;s think if we move the center from here to here</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:16.300" style="s2">Does that matter?</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.550" end="01:01:22.810" style="s2">Like other rotations still correct. This rotation is still going to be correct, but these rotations</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.130" end="01:01:28.420" style="s2">Well, see that&#39;s the thing I don&#39;t really know right</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.540" end="01:01:33.249" style="s2">Which is applied first the rotation or the translation</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.460" end="01:01:40.460" style="s2">Does it tell me</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.290" end="01:02:09.430" style="s2">Give us the position of the optical center of the color camera with respect to the world origins defined by the rotate as the motion</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.430" end="01:02:12.279" style="s2">Capture system. Okay, so that seems pretty obvious to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.930" end="01:02:17.949" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s the rotation that&#39;s confusing</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.410" end="01:02:27.789" style="s2">So it does seem like the first thing I do is the fact that the translation that&#39;s what is that gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.120" end="01:02:33.430" style="s2">It really depends on which is applied first, but no no that might be okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.230" end="01:02:41.650" style="s2">So now that if I if I subtract out the translation I get a new color does have colors. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.620" end="01:02:44.620" style="s2">No, I want colors</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.930" end="01:02:47.739" style="s2">Their colors over here or colors all perfect</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.380" end="01:02:50.709" style="s2">okay, so if I subtract out the translation</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.920" end="01:02:54.489" style="s2">With my current understanding of it. It&#39;s just gonna move</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.190" end="01:02:57.190" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.870" end="01:03:01.870" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna delete this</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.130" end="01:03:06.130" style="s2">It&#39;s gonna move this to here</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.750" end="01:03:11.890" style="s2">That&#39;s what subtracting out the translation should do right</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:22.660" style="s2">So if I subtract out the translation should just do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.160" end="01:03:33.099" style="s2">And then I can&#39;t really understand right, maybe I want to deploy</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.380" end="01:03:38.380" style="s2">Each rotation</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.510" end="01:03:47.510" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.700" end="01:03:52.700" style="s2">Tried D. Applying the whole rotation</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.210" end="01:04:00.019" style="s2">But that&#39;s clearly not right? Okay. So what I tried to do there was just D apply this big rotation</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.950" end="01:04:04.309" style="s2">But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:09.500" style="s2">We can t applying the rotation from each translation</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.050" end="01:04:23.840" style="s2">And that should disentangle, oh no, no no no we don&#39;t have to do that. There should be one rotation gets us back</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.570" end="01:04:42.919" style="s2">But see that&#39;s weird because at least now all the movement is a long one axis, it&#39;s just the y axis so</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.750" end="01:04:53.060" style="s2">That just has like a fixed offset wrong subtract out the translation D apply the rotation from each translation</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.890" end="01:04:59.510" style="s2">Do you actually mean that is that is that a serious suggestion</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.300" end="01:05:14.300" style="s2">Here the rotations</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.660" end="01:05:17.660" style="s2">So they clearly change</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.380" end="01:05:22.730" style="s2">Let&#39;s do you ply the rotations from the rotations start with that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.210" end="01:05:30.050" style="s2">So it&#39;s clearly rotating</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.349" end="01:05:38.119" style="s2">Which I mean it makes sense, right? It makes sense in the perspective of this thing is moving</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.440" end="01:05:49.400" style="s2">But like what doesn&#39;t make sense is why</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.270" end="01:05:54.709" style="s2">The translations aren&#39;t correct when I do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.870" end="01:06:00.499" style="s2">That should make the translations, correct</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.580" end="01:06:07.669" style="s2">But dust they&#39;re wrong oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.770" end="01:06:15.770" style="s2">We will we&#39;ll wait</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.810" end="01:06:19.459" style="s2">gives the orientation of the optical centre of</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.130" end="01:06:26.269" style="s2">The colour camera with respect to world origin. Aha. So what that actually is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.000" end="01:06:29.330" style="s2">This rotation is what it&#39;s giving me</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.900" end="01:06:32.760" style="s2">So, whoops</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.760" end="01:06:35.209" style="s2">I have a blue blue, please</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.120" end="01:06:39.469" style="s2">Can I can I have a blue? Yep. Yep. Oh, I got a press okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.470" end="01:06:44.900" style="s2">I see that I see what your brows were saying. Okay, so that&#39;s that rotation</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.710" end="01:06:49.220" style="s2">Here&#39;s the position of the optical centre with respect to the world origin</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.220" end="01:06:51.949" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s the position of the Alpha done with respect world origin</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.560" end="01:06:56.479" style="s2">That rotation here tells me how to rotate that</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.480" end="01:06:59.480" style="s2">- look at - but</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.090" end="01:07:03.049" style="s2">Then I still don&#39;t understand. Why what I said was wrong, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.050" end="01:07:07.070" style="s2">So if I just subtract out that and rotate them all based on the first one</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.170" end="01:07:12.530" style="s2">That seems like it should be correct I</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.220" end="01:07:19.220" style="s2">Don&#39;t really understand it</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:29.950" style="s2">I&#39;ll be back</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.720" end="01:08:27.720" style="s2">The orientation</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.270" end="01:08:34.049" style="s2">The optical center with respect to world orientation transpose first, okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.049" end="01:08:36.629" style="s2">So inverse is the same thing as transpose for a rotation matrix</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.920" end="01:08:40.920" style="s2">Tan inverse they say I do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.670" end="01:08:44.670" style="s2">Well</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.400" end="01:08:47.400" style="s2">That&#39;s actually spookily the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.830" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">Which makes sense from D applying like one rotation, right</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.450" end="01:09:02.490" style="s2">Position in the optical center of the color camera with respects the world origin is defined by the motion captionist</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.970" end="01:09:09.029" style="s2">The orientation of the optical center of the color camera in the former unicorn with respect to the world origin</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.589" end="01:09:13.589" style="s2">But see like that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.730" end="01:09:20.730" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.200" end="01:09:28.769" style="s2">Okay, here&#39;s my theory now</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.750" end="01:09:33.750" style="s2">My theory is that this one is correct</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.670" end="01:09:39.870" style="s2">But the axes just don&#39;t correspond</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.120" end="01:09:56.120" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.740" end="01:10:02.630" style="s2">Well, there&#39;s no there&#39;s no reason the axes have to correspond right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.200" end="01:10:12.860" style="s2">Wish they included like a little like picture for explain things, but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.720" end="01:10:21.110" style="s2">If you think about it, right we don&#39;t know what the motion capture system</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.480" end="01:10:31.400" style="s2">We don&#39;t know how the motion captured the system defines the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.180" end="01:10:35.180" style="s2">Defines the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.150" end="01:10:40.819" style="s2">But otherwise those look correct right except for the fact that the axes are messed up</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.840" end="01:10:47.090" style="s2">Like the motion capture system might define the world in some weird frame</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.930" end="01:10:54.889" style="s2">Let&#39;s see which one that matches because I think we can actually do this now</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.020" end="01:11:05.689" style="s2">Yeah, so this is the one that&#39;s increasing a tiny bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.140" end="01:11:12.140" style="s2">There&#39;s a negative one</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.610" end="01:11:21.769" style="s2">There&#39;s a negative one there&#39;s a small negative one. Wait, does that like change a lot?</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.360" end="01:11:28.789" style="s2">Wow, it&#39;s like different for initialization. That&#39;s the highest quality shit now</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.790" end="01:11:32.479" style="s2">There&#39;s like a small negative one a slightly larger positive one and a big positive one. So</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.020" end="01:11:39.590" style="s2">If I look here there&#39;s a small negative one, there&#39;s a slightly larger positive one and is it okay?</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.890" end="01:11:43.970" style="s2">Yeah, you found marybelle script. Let&#39;s take a look</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.530" end="01:11:48.530" style="s2">Maybe they talk about it in here. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.600" end="01:11:53.600" style="s2">Hey, look it&#39;s he exists</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.240" end="01:11:59.809" style="s2">So they&#39;re putting the translation in there I</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.390" end="01:12:08.359" style="s2">Know they&#39;re doing we thought they have the ugliest interpolation you&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.140" end="01:12:12.169" style="s2">The rotations a long trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.420" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">Yeah, well I mean we can see what it is now, right, so the problem is just that these things are in the wrong order</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.940" end="01:12:28.940" style="s2">Until we have to also do a transposition</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.950" end="01:12:36.950" style="s2">The key T</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.090" end="01:12:43.369" style="s2">Equals GG t 1 to 0</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.850" end="01:12:52.850" style="s2">About 1 to 0</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.130" end="01:12:58.130" style="s2">We want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.480" end="01:13:04.250" style="s2">First pick the small negative 1 so it&#39;s 2 0</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.220" end="01:13:10.909" style="s2">There we go, those should match pretty closely now</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.540" end="01:13:19.519" style="s2">High-quality, holy shit guys, ok</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.070" end="01:13:28.609" style="s2">Well, so that&#39;s actually a rotation that we can apply</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.090" end="01:13:37.510" style="s2">We can we can just talk about that rotation</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.950" end="01:13:41.950" style="s2">Orient</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.260" end="01:13:44.260" style="s2">Python</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.360" end="01:13:46.360" style="s2">Like an orient library</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.870" end="01:13:50.200" style="s2">Or is that just that just might be built in Tacoma</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.390" end="01:13:58.059" style="s2">So that that rotation can actually be done okay, so if we have the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.270" end="01:14:00.920" style="s2">y-axis</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.920" end="01:14:06.940" style="s2">And we want to become the z-axis. We want the z-axis to become the x-axis. We gotta do that</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.380" end="01:14:14.300" style="s2">No, no, it&#39;s just annoying</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.300" end="01:14:18.939" style="s2">But the reason we have to do it in a rotation matrix is so we can apply the same thing to the rotation</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.840" end="01:14:28.840" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.480" end="01:14:32.980" style="s2">We want to be yes, we just want to do with our rotation matrix I</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.740" end="01:14:36.399" style="s2">Think the matrix actually wait, I can define that matrix very easily</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.220" end="01:14:40.780" style="s2">So if I want to to go with 0 is just 1 1 0 1</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.420" end="01:14:44.140" style="s2">1 0 0 0 1 1</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.590" end="01:14:47.590" style="s2">We&#39;ll call this</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.410" end="01:14:50.410" style="s2">Camera frame</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.380" end="01:15:20.429" style="s2">Okay, so effectively what I did is just to find that as a matrix where we can apply that same matrix to the rotations</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.630" end="01:15:27.059" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s at least ground truth for translation, let&#39;s get country through everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.960" end="01:15:34.109" style="s2">So for the rotations, let&#39;s go back to our paint, bro</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.410" end="01:15:40.410" style="s2">Rotation was gonna be a little bit trickier. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.310" end="01:15:48.420" style="s2">Wait, they just talked about the optical center with respect to the the origin. So just uh apply the first rotation</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:10.559" style="s2">Actually might be all we need to do I only need to certainly apply this as well camera frame from capture</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.120" end="01:16:24.120" style="s2">That&#39;s not even right</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.790" end="01:16:30.790" style="s2">All right first</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.270" end="01:16:34.779" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s probably more right, okay cool</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.300" end="01:16:44.890" style="s2">Well put it this way let&#39;s do that first then we shouldn&#39;t leave that</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.010" end="01:17:03.730" style="s2">Yeah, cool, so we&#39;ll just apply that to the rotation really candy apply the first rotation</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.830" end="01:17:17.799" style="s2">We have to do apply it after we apply it the translation, um well</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.360" end="01:17:25.420" style="s2">If that&#39;s the case, let&#39;s go back to you making this simpler. Let&#39;s try this thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.260" end="01:17:32.260" style="s2">Ideally I would like to do it like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.130" end="01:18:15.130" style="s2">Okay, that&#39;s pretty good I</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:25.990" style="s2">Don&#39;t actually know if the rotations are correct</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.370" end="01:18:32.140" style="s2">Maybe we&#39;ll find out sooner rather than later when we actually had to put these things in just slam</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.740" end="01:18:38.740" style="s2">By</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.640" end="01:18:45.640" style="s2">Sounds good</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.750" end="01:19:01.750" style="s2">Brings poses it</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.040" end="01:19:27.369" style="s2">Gggg, oh I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.320" end="01:20:10.299" style="s2">Well, so we actually don&#39;t want to just do polls because that&#39;s in the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.090" end="01:20:22.270" style="s2">You guys enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.290" end="01:20:29.290" style="s2">High quality shit</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.130" end="01:20:38.130" style="s2">That&#39;s the multiplier</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.790" end="01:20:47.790" style="s2">Kind of wrong</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.170" end="01:20:58.170" style="s2">50 is like the stylus winding</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.400" end="01:21:09.400" style="s2">Broke em</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.370" end="01:21:16.570" style="s2">Well, so the thing is poses then we want to pose optimization anymore. I</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.560" end="01:21:33.670" style="s2">Don&#39;t know why it like okay, it just moves them back to their</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.830" end="01:21:40.930" style="s2">Attack it for now to fix the pose. You know, what?</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.730" end="01:21:59.439" style="s2">Okay, well this is where this is where things go if you just trust a graduate</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.780" end="01:22:13.329" style="s2">Of course everything becomes kind of bullshit but</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.999" end="01:22:18.999" style="s2">My rotations might be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.269" end="01:22:25.269" style="s2">But that&#39;s the graduate of the data set</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.790" end="01:22:33.790" style="s2">My rotation throw</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.140" end="01:22:43.160" style="s2">Or am I like let&#39;s take a look and say we actually I&#39;m moving that way that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.300" end="01:22:48.770" style="s2">So the translations are definitely correct, I just don&#39;t know about the rotations</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.780" end="01:23:03.929" style="s2">Okay, it works so poorly I</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.800" end="01:23:25.829" style="s2">Know it&#39;s cool. We can just put this here</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.200" end="01:23:43.050" style="s2">That stuff doesn&#39;t hurt we can actually add in observations before we get a pose</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.150" end="01:24:04.609" style="s2">Okay, so that keeps doing that probably cuz my rotations are wrong</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.460" end="01:24:13.189" style="s2">Let&#39;s try the rotation dataset, let&#39;s see if we get the rotations to be right</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.820" end="01:24:20.060" style="s2">And then I&#39;m gonna go I have about twenty minutes more with you guys you know how this goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.300" end="01:24:23.419" style="s2">Yeah, okay. So the rotations are just totally bogus</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.930" end="01:24:29.930" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.170" end="01:24:37.220" style="s2">Let&#39;s go back to trying to debug that so we know the first thing that happens is a rotation in that direction</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.200" end="01:24:43.819" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s the cb2 Rodrigues function let&#39;s try that</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.330" end="01:24:50.330" style="s2">Right here</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.210" end="01:25:10.010" style="s2">Previous so what cv2 Rodriguez does is it just felt right?</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.510" end="01:25:18.769" style="s2">It&#39;s just gonna print out like the Euler angles</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.600" end="01:25:29.149" style="s2">Prints out the Euler angles. It&#39;s very hard to like see whatever paper maybe says</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.540" end="01:25:36.950" style="s2">Of course. Yes, of course. That&#39;s no I need my parentheses because this is Python 3 7 most people. All right</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.530" end="01:25:42.050" style="s2">So those are clearly wrong like we know what&#39;s happening here. We know how it&#39;s rotating and it&#39;s not working like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.870" end="01:25:44.870" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.469" end="01:26:05.928" style="s2">So ok standing argument that we have to do that because I that&#39;s why I do the translation</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.739" end="01:26:09.739" style="s2">That&#39;s alright</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.679" end="01:26:13.518" style="s2">We know the first thing that happens is a rotation like this</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.909" end="01:26:55.399" style="s2">So let&#39;s first confirm that there&#39;s actually no translation in this data set</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.210" end="01:27:12.769" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much about translation is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.550" end="01:27:21.050" style="s2">We multiplying it by 20, where&#39;s x over there, well, that&#39;s actually some kind of translation</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.059" end="01:27:26.059" style="s2">Makes me think we could be wrong again</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.610" end="01:27:41.839" style="s2">Do you think what we actually might want to do is apply each rotation</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.929" end="01:27:59.929" style="s2">That some translation -</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.849" end="01:28:08.509" style="s2">If we didn&#39;t really think this through we just kind of typed</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.570" end="01:28:14.570" style="s2">This is so shitty I</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.499" end="01:28:18.529" style="s2">Don&#39;t really know how to debug this I</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.710" end="01:28:29.899" style="s2">Just know that that well that&#39;s actually right but only because our optimizer so powerful. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.820" end="01:28:34.820" style="s2">My gos we&#39;re not saying GG post, yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.030" end="01:28:44.059" style="s2">Like that&#39;s saying that it&#39;s translating right there&#39;s clear translation there which is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.630" end="01:28:50.630" style="s2">Mm</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.079" end="01:28:54.919" style="s2">Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Let&#39;s look at this</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.750" end="01:29:10.369" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking of map box locate later than that by the way familes going to be there</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.480" end="01:29:19.699" style="s2">So interesting so they have a they&#39;re showing their registration translation here I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.540" end="01:29:25.189" style="s2">Yeah, there&#39;s a translation here and there shouldn&#39;t be because there&#39;s no translation</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.500" end="01:29:33.500" style="s2">No, wait, there&#39;s no translation</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.619" end="01:29:42.619" style="s2">Where does it make sense because</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.469" end="01:29:49.428" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s yeah no no is that translation</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.000" end="01:29:53.149" style="s2">Set an appreciable amount of translation</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.110" end="01:29:58.579" style="s2">Do I have to uh, apply each rotation as the question</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.090" end="01:30:08.560" style="s2">Do I have to uh, apply the rotations before I subtract out the org</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.510" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">Tomorrow we&#39;re gonna get paper and we&#39;re gonna try this with paper. Yeah, Bruce</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.770" end="01:30:35.770" style="s2">That&#39;s like way more off</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.480" end="01:30:55.449" style="s2">It&#39;s still saying this translation the old Jill hot is dead kill him</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.690" end="01:31:01.960" style="s2">Do that hey, that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.270" end="01:31:11.020" style="s2">That translation is translate I</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.560" end="01:31:20.589" style="s2">Shouldn&#39;t be translation. I still think so</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.719" end="01:31:26.138" style="s2">It sure looks like there&#39;s no translation I</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.500" end="01:31:30.129" style="s2">Don&#39;t get it. I mean, this is very clear about saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.449" end="01:31:37.689" style="s2">With respect to the world origin is defined by the motion capture system. That&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.989" end="01:32:04.618" style="s2">It holds our reverse I searched the store today</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.219" end="01:32:11.879" style="s2">Okay, let&#39;s put it back to the thing that we know works for that</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.050" end="01:32:33.989" style="s2">So that works for that and the only thing we don&#39;t know is what we have to do for rotation</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.770" end="01:32:39.299" style="s2">The thing is almost anything will work for this one</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.900" end="01:32:52.889" style="s2">You know, they&#39;re all messed up wait, hang on not almost anything will work that&#39;s just completely wrong</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.070" end="01:33:10.829" style="s2">I mean now that are like subtleties and in correctness</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.929" end="01:33:30.929" style="s2">Maybe we need to invert them</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.840" end="01:33:49.650" style="s2">See it&#39;s showing translation that&#39;s translation that I don&#39;t really believe</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.480" end="01:33:58.469" style="s2">But the rotation is completely wrong I&#39;m gonna sound like rotation and translation are are intertwined</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.550" end="01:34:15.000" style="s2">What the optimizer says it is it puts them down here</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.420" end="01:35:13.839" style="s2">Scale to have sworn enemy of binocular Slammers everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.699" end="01:35:22.029" style="s2">No, but like the rotations are wrong and that&#39;s why this is messing up you see them they&#39;re not right I</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.370" end="01:35:39.640" style="s2">Can really want no border matters on these things</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.140" end="01:35:57.459" style="s2">Yeah, you see why that one has to go first, right</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.150" end="01:36:07.449" style="s2">It&#39;s really wrong with the rotation</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.960" end="01:36:14.679" style="s2">All right guys I gotta go to work</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.010" end="01:36:23.170" style="s2">See clearly my rotations are wrong we&#39;re gonna think this through later</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.190" end="01:36:28.149" style="s2">This is at least right</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.980" end="01:36:36.159" style="s2">In the presence of small rotation</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.829" end="01:36:54.149" style="s2">Let&#39;s just make sure the things work and I don&#39;t submit any ground truth is cuz I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.749" end="01:37:40.109" style="s2">But let&#39;s make sure the good example still works</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.489" end="01:37:52.198" style="s2">For some initialization bug cool. All right guys, I&#39;m gonna commit this</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.499" end="01:37:58.499" style="s2">Let&#39;s give a prize to</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.539" end="01:38:01.978" style="s2">Anybody who can actually if somebody can fix this we&#39;ll give you a price. I</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.559" end="01:38:09.418" style="s2">Don&#39;t know what the price will be. But you know me. I&#39;ll be back on streaming the same hours tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.900" end="01:38:15.869" style="s2">Because like Logan Paul Jake Paul say, it&#39;s everyday bro. I</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.139" end="01:38:20.129" style="s2">Think I think it&#39;s everyday bro is really a really inspirational</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.539" end="01:38:29.009" style="s2">Thing like you know this everyday bro, like it&#39;s just it&#39;s inspirational because it is everyday</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.360" end="01:38:44.269" style="s2">Like that&#39;s a really yeah great. Thank you guys. Let&#39;s commit so we&#39;ll call it broken ass ground treat aspect</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.190" end="01:38:53.960" style="s2">Broken ass round through testing of matrix is hard</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.210" end="01:39:05.270" style="s2">The yo, what can I slow the foam that I want fixed again, so if you go in here</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.010" end="01:39:12.409" style="s2">This is clearly not the right ground truth for this for this video</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.450" end="01:39:16.639" style="s2">Look at how look at how it says that the camera is rotating like an D it like that right? So</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.280" end="01:39:20.209" style="s2">it&#39;s because the way I&#39;m extracting the ground truth is wrong just</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.030" end="01:39:24.320" style="s2">Like I have my like order of my matrix multiplies wrong or something</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.860" end="01:39:28.669" style="s2">So you can check out down here it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.940" end="01:39:32.899" style="s2">That&#39;s wrong. So that&#39;s what I want fixed</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.570" end="01:39:41.570" style="s2">But yeah, good luck with that shit guys I</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.170" end="01:39:45.440" style="s2">Am out I will see y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.220" end="01:39:49.220" style="s2">Tomorrow same time</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.679" end="01:40:06.769" style="s2">You&#39;ll see what we have today what song should we start with</p>

<p begin="01:40:44.849" end="01:40:46.849" style="s2">I</p>

<p begin="01:41:53.050" end="01:41:55.050" style="s2">And then that stuff messes up</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.189" end="01:42:01.559" style="s2">That&#39;s supposed to be rotation it&#39;s not that&#39;s because my shits long</p>

<p begin="01:42:21.099" end="01:42:23.489" style="s2">So what we&#39;re trying to do is we&#39;re trying to get the</p>

<p begin="01:43:03.880" end="01:43:06.119" style="s2">Ek dark sky. How do I activate subs?</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.979" end="01:43:10.979" style="s2">Yeah, and what what sourcing the map data</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.650" end="01:43:16.650" style="s2">Sourcing the maps</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.749" end="01:43:25.978" style="s2">The reason I think that about FPGAs and GPUs is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.650" end="01:43:31.229" style="s2">You&#39;re just not gonna get that much of an improvement over GPUs, right? It&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.050" end="01:43:38.610" style="s2">It&#39;s all about how many transistors you use right</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.179" end="01:43:43.469" style="s2">I&#39;ll look into I&#39;ll look into why nobody can subscribe after this</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.460" end="01:43:53.609" style="s2">But it&#39;s about how many transistors are used and</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.960" end="01:44:00.149" style="s2">GPUs are already using like 80 percent of the transistors. So maybe we can get a 20 percent boost</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.150" end="01:44:02.150" style="s2">You&#39;re not gonna get like a huge boost</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.349" end="01:44:05.069" style="s2">people think like the transition from</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.360" end="01:44:10.409" style="s2">GPUs to a6 is gonna be similar to the transition from</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.559" end="01:44:17.788" style="s2">CPUs two GPUs, and that just isn&#39;t true. This isn&#39;t like mining like if you&#39;re doing like Bitcoin mining. Yeah, you&#39;re actually huge advantages</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.019" end="01:44:22.169" style="s2">From doing it with</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.760" end="01:44:32.099" style="s2">Her cuz I&#39;m tired I&#39;m from phoom phoom switching to an ASA I just woke up. I think your friends as much astronaut really</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.590" end="01:44:43.259" style="s2">Are you just doing the twitch affiliate program? Oh I&#39;m gonna be an affiliate. Oh, wow, that&#39;s bullshit</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.699" end="01:44:48.268" style="s2">Well, I like being I like being affiliated with shit</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.019" end="01:44:53.819" style="s2">Alright, so where are we well, I</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.570" end="01:44:59.489" style="s2">Was thinking maybe we could apply this thing globally</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.019" end="01:45:08.219" style="s2">Let&#39;s first try this I was thinking today we try just applying shit to the pose makers</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.180" end="01:45:12.690" style="s2">So that the whole thing is kind of like Apple I do it once</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.150" end="01:45:38.250" style="s2">Instead of applying it just throw tation matrix because I think my translation was correct</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.570" end="01:45:44.880" style="s2">Okay, so whatever happened there it really messes these up</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.780" end="01:45:59.940" style="s2">She&#39;s going on. Oh, wow, that&#39;s Friday. Yes</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.100" end="01:46:08.100" style="s2">So d applying the pose</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.160" end="01:46:14.160" style="s2">Okay, well that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.810" end="01:46:23.459" style="s2">Like the code to fix translation was actually correct. I was just rotating it by this</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.930" end="01:46:35.699" style="s2">Um, I don&#39;t need money too much money man</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.340" end="01:46:42.090" style="s2">They can google the learned index paper</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.090" end="01:46:47.130" style="s2">Yeah, I mean look at my cat mind makes sense for google cuz like maybe you can&#39;t even get to X</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.710" end="01:46:49.710" style="s2">But you&#39;re not gonna get 10x is all I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.800" end="01:46:52.800" style="s2">Okay, it&#39;s not enough to overcome</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.469" end="01:46:56.789" style="s2">Like code inertia. Alright, cuz they&#39;re gonna be harder to code for the GPUs</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.040" end="01:47:06.390" style="s2">Another quarter nyan matrix, which had different values. Okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.230" end="01:47:10.230" style="s2">According to this</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.600" end="01:47:17.579" style="s2">This was the translation yet. That works. Let&#39;s go back to acts wisely. I could see it better there have</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.050" end="01:47:22.170" style="s2">Some translation thing that actually worked</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.199" end="01:48:09.839" style="s2">Yeah, so that&#39;s putting all the stuff on the z axis you can see it there Oh</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.640" end="01:48:13.640" style="s2">Cruz are raising money</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.040" end="01:48:17.040" style="s2">Raising money is not an accomplishment</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.260" end="01:48:22.230" style="s2">Raising running is a sign of your weakness and they advertise it like it&#39;s a strength</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.320" end="01:48:26.640" style="s2">We raise money. I was ashamed as you should be</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.610" end="01:48:31.380" style="s2">It means that you haven&#39;t been probably you haven&#39;t made your company profitable you had to better</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.250" end="01:48:50.250" style="s2">Okay, so if you D apply the rotation</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.570" end="01:48:57.360" style="s2">Which is basically just applied no rotation then you get translation in the right sense</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.120" end="01:49:08.909" style="s2">Let&#39;s let&#39;s look through this and we&#39;re thinking this morning, so I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.730" end="01:49:29.969" style="s2">It&#39;s a position of the optical sense of the collar cam with respect to the world origin is defined by the motion capture system the</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.969" end="01:49:34.529" style="s2">Orientation of the optical center of a color camera the value and a quarter neon respect to the world Orange</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.590" end="01:49:37.590" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.560" end="01:49:44.939" style="s2">The translation was weird and it&#39;s questionable whether I want to apply the rotation</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.130" end="01:49:51.179" style="s2">The transformation matrix is different my defective</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.350" end="01:49:59.789" style="s2">Yeah, I mean Tesla should be ashamed of the money they raise to I think you on actually properly is ashamed</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.409" end="01:50:05.309" style="s2">Hi, sorry, I&#39;m reading this on this little on about let&#39;s go over here</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.890" end="01:50:12.890" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.660" end="01:50:19.189" style="s2">Yeah, this is the exact same logic they just call it transform for for</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.910" end="01:50:25.910" style="s2">The efforts and</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.969" end="01:50:28.969" style="s2">Have that same function Oh</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.050" end="01:50:33.050" style="s2">What is it different</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.920" end="01:50:36.920" style="s2">Why is this different</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.430" end="01:50:40.430" style="s2">Why did I put two two there?</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.610" end="01:50:46.610" style="s2">Look there nothing is different from my</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.430" end="01:50:52.430" style="s2">Say</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.030" end="01:51:05.389" style="s2">So weird I thought the numbers are different</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.030" end="01:51:22.670" style="s2">Let&#39;s try this thing else is the same Oh</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.170" end="01:51:27.589" style="s2">Mike return you know, it&#39;s just weird or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.730" end="01:51:52.879" style="s2">Yeah, okay cool well that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.690" end="01:51:56.690" style="s2">Good fine, bro</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.260" end="01:52:03.560" style="s2">Yeah, now those are the correct thing and I didn&#39;t have to do any weird camera phone, okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.010" end="01:52:07.010" style="s2">Wow, okay, that might have been my bug</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.790" end="01:52:11.629" style="s2">Yeah, the values are different like that, I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.440" end="01:52:15.710" style="s2">Don&#39;t know what could turn e on I hat. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.530" end="01:52:21.050" style="s2">Maybe you just double use the last thing and they usually put W is the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.360" end="01:52:26.360" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.150" end="01:52:32.150" style="s2">See</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.679" end="01:52:38.719" style="s2">Yeah, why do they put W as the last I think that&#39;s the distinction right</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.840" end="01:52:49.909" style="s2">T was actually off by yeah. Okay. So this old thing was assuming</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.670" end="01:53:04.129" style="s2">Okay, there&#39;s a different ordering of the Couture yard, you see the problem good find a bra</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.730" end="01:53:07.730" style="s2">So it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.400" end="01:53:10.400" style="s2">Knot</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.199" end="01:53:15.919" style="s2">Which is probably a more sensible way to do it, right</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.849" end="01:53:22.579" style="s2">Okay, cool down that bug nice job nice job, all right</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.020" end="01:53:30.830" style="s2">So now we get with the inverse and now I think you can probably just do this Miss bobbye&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.849" end="01:53:40.339" style="s2">Yeah, all right bro, nice job, all right, let&#39;s have a bug cool</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.670" end="01:53:46.009" style="s2">Turn yawns. We&#39;re out of order. And now the most obvious thing is correct</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.310" end="01:54:01.310" style="s2">See how that works</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.170" end="01:54:09.469" style="s2">Sometimes we get more translation, ah</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.190" end="01:54:13.190" style="s2">They work now cool</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.610" end="01:54:18.650" style="s2">Cool bros heroes. All right, it works</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.830" end="01:54:30.830" style="s2">Here this is less broken</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.849" end="01:54:39.019" style="s2">Mmm, it looks a lot better still saying this translation. Believe me if they&#39;re actually yes</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.190" end="01:54:49.219" style="s2">Let&#39;s get rid of that times 50 right there</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.550" end="01:54:55.550" style="s2">Are the times altogether</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.949" end="01:55:01.819" style="s2">Yeah, cool seems a lot better</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.120" end="01:55:38.720" style="s2">Okay, so we&#39;re not gonna sensibly get the death of anything</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.350" end="01:56:10.700" style="s2">I mean the camera is drawing is just so massive. Just kind of wrong. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.050" end="01:56:15.050" style="s2">I like do something stupid</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.250" end="01:56:19.230" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.230" end="01:56:24.439" style="s2">The other thing I was thinking is we should probably write a grant repost processor and like put in a more reasonable format</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.929" end="01:56:46.609" style="s2">And you ever come to my things, you know the talks probably I don&#39;t know they don&#39;t thank that I just say the same bullshit</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.380" end="01:56:51.409" style="s2">Alright, let&#39;s commit that good job</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.429" end="01:56:58.429" style="s2">Boston Mass. Is it bro? You&#39;re doing the price. I mean you&#39;d win a prize if you send it a pull request</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.500" end="01:57:34.879" style="s2">Lowest otoscope you sometimes but now we do churches so you can come on and you can see my trechie soon</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.170" end="01:57:39.170" style="s2">Peace of all</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.469" end="01:57:58.449" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.449" end="01:58:03.269" style="s2">Let&#39;s just write let&#39;s write this is a separate tool like that shouldn&#39;t really be part of a main tool</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.810" end="01:58:06.810" style="s2">All of this creature</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.520" end="02:00:37.299" style="s2">Thank you put that in helpers, you know to be honest</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.300" end="02:00:52.090" style="s2">That&#39;s really used for like we just don&#39;t use return eons, so it&#39;s not really a healthy for slam I should even put this here</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.020" end="02:01:08.680" style="s2">See like now we just have this the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.030" end="02:02:17.009" style="s2">Okay, so we have like that NPV file, why doesn&#39;t alright love this</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.660" end="02:02:28.110" style="s2">AR zero with a stupid name</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.190" end="02:02:35.190" style="s2">Why is it a stupid name?</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.540" end="02:02:43.260" style="s2">It&#39;s not possible if I don&#39;t know the names of the arrays</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.100" end="02:02:56.100" style="s2">Those oh</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.580" end="02:03:02.970" style="s2">Yeah, I don&#39;t give a shit about the past gross</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.960" end="02:03:10.680" style="s2">Forget the past there is only the future</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.380" end="02:04:31.489" style="s2">Hoes not filing the archive but what I called it pose first and</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.349" end="02:04:55.308" style="s2">ARR zero, they didn&#39;t call it our zero</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.540" end="02:05:23.290" style="s2">Didn&#39;t call it a RZR. Why does it do that? I</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.389" end="02:05:36.939" style="s2">Called it posed. It doesn&#39;t make sense. I raise just saving the file a raise will be saved in a file with the keyboard names</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.919" end="02:06:19.858" style="s2">Humans a race to save the file a race will be saved in the file with the keyword names</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.149" end="02:06:33.899" style="s2">And it has the name pose I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.209" end="02:06:57.059" style="s2">Go now if I don&#39;t pass that down I should learn my Emacs</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.879" end="02:07:22.379" style="s2">Um, if you&#39;re downloading my videos you&#39;re violating my copyright</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.099" end="02:07:29.099" style="s2">You know, I care very deeply intellectual property and I&#39;ll sue all of you sue people</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.469" end="02:07:38.818" style="s2">What a morning man, what a morning welcome to Thursday yeah a date tonight we&#39;re kind of excited about that</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.929" end="02:07:42.929" style="s2">That&#39;s kind of exciting</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.409" end="02:07:46.409" style="s2">What else is exciting</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.049" end="02:07:49.679" style="s2">But the Groucho Marx doesn&#39;t so exciting</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.419" end="02:07:57.239" style="s2">Ok, so we have a little problem with this the scale very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.969" end="02:08:02.969" style="s2">Thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.510" end="02:09:14.119" style="s2">Put this down back there now anything that works zero</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.639" end="02:09:29.328" style="s2">Okay, so now that&#39;s it a normal scale factor, let&#39;s just try for a second not optimizing the pose at all</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.899" end="02:09:33.529" style="s2">You can turn that off and point out and</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.159" end="02:09:37.159" style="s2">Everywhere we add frame</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.159" end="02:09:55.159" style="s2">Segmentation faults</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.489" end="02:10:02.819" style="s2">If that&#39;s concerning yeah optimizer can&#39;t run if I tell it it can&#39;t move the frames</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.860" end="02:10:10.860" style="s2">What&#39;s seg faulting</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.610" end="02:10:39.610" style="s2">Optimized</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.389" end="02:10:43.389" style="s2">Ground truth proposed</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.559" end="02:10:47.559" style="s2">Weird</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.989" end="02:10:53.989" style="s2">This you back bro</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.630" end="02:11:00.049" style="s2">Its Weiss a segfault cuz someone tell me</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.260" end="02:11:02.999" style="s2">bullshit</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.999" end="02:11:05.659" style="s2">You&#39;re telling me I have to enable that optimize</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.300" end="02:11:08.300" style="s2">What doesn&#39;t work?</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.780" end="02:11:14.840" style="s2">Is that what&#39;s really happening I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.929" end="02:11:21.888" style="s2">Well, sure disable the optimizer and see what we get</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.889" end="02:11:37.308" style="s2">This is just estimating the positions from now, there&#39;s some nice and smooth it looks</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.579" end="02:11:42.349" style="s2">Alright, like this is the true camera motion. It&#39;s beautiful smooth motion</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.260" end="02:11:48.260" style="s2">Wait out the optimal</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.060" end="02:12:05.350" style="s2">But now&#39;s on optimizing the points and stupid points are appearing behind the camera</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.320" end="02:12:23.369" style="s2">You don&#39;t need to have this archive stop archive the past doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.150" end="02:12:43.320" style="s2">Okay, so I still understand why the sidewalls</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.030" end="02:12:54.030" style="s2">Shouldn&#39;t be called with fixed points</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.730" end="02:13:02.730" style="s2">Phoebe I</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.420" end="02:13:11.550" style="s2">Don&#39;t have GED either LOD be over the logo will be be off my favorite debugger. Wait. Yeah. I can&#39;t doesn&#39;t even walk. Thanks</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.700" end="02:13:14.700" style="s2">Thanks, ll be gay</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.330" end="02:13:29.399" style="s2">Huh, oh it doesn&#39;t crash on the debugger except it doesn&#39;t display the bullshit</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.900" end="02:13:33.900" style="s2">High five is disabled</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.570" end="02:13:56.019" style="s2">So things like don&#39;t work, but that&#39;s okay I cool. What do we get? We got a null pointer</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.980" end="02:13:59.980" style="s2">In</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.200" end="02:14:02.200" style="s2">The optimizer</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.770" end="02:14:05.770" style="s2">Why are we getting a null pointer?</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.100" end="02:14:21.789" style="s2">Where are we getting where is the optimizer running?</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.030" end="02:14:40.030" style="s2">You know segmentation fault 11</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.909" end="02:14:49.119" style="s2">Really work up to here</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.219" end="02:15:04.299" style="s2">And that&#39;s gonna be me that shit about all the last time oh, yeah, don&#39;t worry, okay great. Thanks. Thanks Python</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.239" end="02:15:19.239" style="s2">But we&#39;ll add the points</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.200" end="02:15:31.710" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t have the points it just doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.430" end="02:15:39.180" style="s2">If I set them all fixed it just crashes all right</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.770" end="02:15:43.770" style="s2">That&#39;s so stupid</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.150" end="02:16:05.489" style="s2">Than they were fixed looks noticeably less smooth right now. Look at that frame. Why did that frame go there bad frame?</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.449" end="02:16:24.449" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.559" end="02:16:47.969" style="s2">All set fix the water</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.699" end="02:16:53.819" style="s2">Set marginalize, I don&#39;t know what this dot</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.559" end="02:17:22.188" style="s2">The map points already set marginalize to tremendously decrease the I</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.599" end="02:17:29.599" style="s2">Don&#39;t know any of this shit man</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.740" end="02:17:50.590" style="s2">The bigger problem is our case in fact if I set these all to fixed it just crashes</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.190" end="02:17:55.419" style="s2">Like how crappy is that so crappy</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.620" end="02:18:01.539" style="s2">Why why does it do that? Why can these not be fixed?</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.370" end="02:18:15.370" style="s2">Now that&#39;s a bug</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.900" end="02:18:38.069" style="s2">Notice this likes to use that same weird quaternion thing where it does X Y Z W interesting, right?</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.710" end="02:18:47.070" style="s2">That&#39;s right the past dozen I mark Hobie and shit, bro</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.230" end="02:19:24.149" style="s2">Make a move or I don&#39;t want stupid family. If you even give it one frame to move its happy</p>
<p begin="02:19:25.630" end="02:19:28.890" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t crash. You can&#39;t give it no frames to move because then it crashes</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.219" end="02:19:35.429" style="s2">Okay, so these are with the ground truth poses. So this isn&#39;t slam anymore. This is just</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.780" end="02:19:42.150" style="s2">Ma-mutt because it&#39;s doing it&#39;s doing mapping and I&#39;m taking the poses from the ground truth</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.820" end="02:19:49.020" style="s2">And mime up doesn&#39;t look that great. Right like my MA has all this bullshit. So we got to get rid of it</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.101" end="02:19:54.720" style="s2">This will give us an opportunity to tune the pruner stage</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.280" end="02:20:01.770" style="s2">You say about this I guys not a real point was that get rid of it. Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.840" end="02:20:12.990" style="s2">Now I have to remember that I can take that back you say you see the problem I&#39;m gonna forget</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.521" end="02:20:25.110" style="s2">Okay less than two point match that&#39;s alt now you read that or empty me narrator five</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.410" end="02:20:28.589" style="s2">Let&#39;s try to go to ascertain the fire</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.420" end="02:20:35.420" style="s2">It was better</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.029" end="02:20:45.029" style="s2">Or any points for being a cult</p>
<p begin="02:20:46.359" end="02:20:53.969" style="s2">Call 24 points are those like higher quality points not really like my problem is why is this crap still up here?</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.609" end="02:20:59.609" style="s2">Does it go away man, it goes away</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.979" end="02:21:10.938" style="s2">Well, they&#39;re basically saying is every point needs to have five matches now and the error needs to be less than no</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.939" end="02:21:12.939" style="s2">No, maybe that&#39;s actually just a really high error</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.840" end="02:21:38.959" style="s2">Yeah, it does kind of look like a vaguely higher</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.249" end="02:21:55.069" style="s2">And the reason he&#39;s failing is because he isn&#39;t taking a depth of the field of view what</p>
<p begin="02:21:57.149" end="02:21:59.149" style="s2">That&#39;s AG fault, oh</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.609" end="02:22:08.629" style="s2">Maybe we deleted all the things in the first frame</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.909" end="02:22:16.099" style="s2">What&#39;s not having in my frame anymore I see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.159" end="02:22:40.159" style="s2">Then let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.609" end="02:22:48.589" style="s2">Old point if lengthy friends five and keyframes 1 dot ID plus</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.729" end="02:22:55.309" style="s2">10 must be detected 1/2 of x is less than</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.489" end="02:23:01.489" style="s2">Right</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.140" end="02:23:25.579" style="s2">So if I D plus 10 is less than</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.550" end="02:23:31.609" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say that sounds good</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.890" end="02:23:37.609" style="s2">I&#39;ll make the point color much more aggressive</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.850" end="02:23:43.850" style="s2">Well, let the map looks better ish</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.359" end="02:23:47.359" style="s2">We&#39;ve got rid of a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.000" end="02:23:51.000" style="s2">Then I&#39;ll back to seg faulting great</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.109" end="02:24:01.109" style="s2">Big Factory</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.210" end="02:24:21.330" style="s2">Math looks better. So once in a while, I&#39;ll just get one where the points go everywhere. I was kind of crap</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.250" end="02:24:27.720" style="s2">Maybe I can fix this with an earlier filter</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.670" end="02:24:41.670" style="s2">Crash as a crash</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.801" end="02:24:47.490" style="s2">You&#39;re now only adding in place that have a lot more information</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.011" end="02:24:54.090" style="s2">Look for something to be a new point. It has to have very high parallax</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.380" end="02:24:58.589" style="s2">So we&#39;re getting some of these crappy points</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.580" end="02:25:03.900" style="s2">These are the ones that are just to have bad future deductions I</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.980" end="02:25:08.310" style="s2">Better figure out how to add back in that check</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.011" end="02:25:14.761" style="s2">So if I want to bring things back to local</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.351" end="02:25:25.261" style="s2">Should be right I dot it with the pose which is sort of transformation from</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.030" end="02:25:32.730" style="s2">I think now we&#39;re not getting any of those points behind the camera anymore</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.520" end="02:25:42.640" style="s2">My mind went too aggressive on this</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.550" end="02:26:00.330" style="s2">I know it looks like it&#39;s organizing into a better map</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.560" end="02:26:10.779" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of going off of nap quality here. But I&#39;m like you can&#39;t leave that crap that</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.289" end="02:26:14.289" style="s2">Isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.539" end="02:26:18.878" style="s2">At all this why are all these points being added to the thing</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.889" end="02:26:29.139" style="s2">All right sure you read the arcsine paper see what or if son who&#39;s calling rules are and we get inspired</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.819" end="02:26:35.078" style="s2">They&#39;ve got all this speckle gone</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.089" end="02:26:45.879" style="s2">Sorry real points is aren&#39;t really in the mouth and I think everything noisier for everything</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.379" end="02:26:50.329" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.329" end="02:26:52.329" style="s2">Let&#39;s put that back to that rule</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.849" end="02:26:54.679" style="s2">Too again</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.679" end="02:27:00.399" style="s2">So now this is like optimizing the pose again and then Alice like crappy. Look, it&#39;s super crappy. Oh look at that crappy</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.399" end="02:27:03.428" style="s2">Oh so crappy and like puts it there. Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:27:06.679" end="02:27:08.679" style="s2">Like moves that was so crappy</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.020" end="02:27:16.020" style="s2">Don&#39;t want use the ground truth</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.010" end="02:27:21.809" style="s2">This is just optimizing and look look good look at shit. Look at that shit</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.989" end="02:27:27.989" style="s2">Richland could be so much better</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.439" end="02:27:36.629" style="s2">It&#39;s weird though, actually when I let it optimize it does a better job like the map looks better, right?</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.899" end="02:27:39.899" style="s2">That looks like a more solid map</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.939" end="02:27:48.509" style="s2">Then when I put in the actual ground truth poses I</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.449" end="02:27:52.649" style="s2">Would assume that the ground treats not wrong and I was something to some other buck</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.229" end="02:27:59.608" style="s2">Took the partial derivative of the pointed 3-space</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.619" end="02:28:09.779" style="s2">You&#39;re seeing words but I really don&#39;t think that any of you make sense the depth of the field of view, hmm</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.359" end="02:28:13.379" style="s2">surface of the high contrast point was this shit</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.489" end="02:28:28.319" style="s2">So I do the Voss constant ever Tim Hecker</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.829" end="02:28:31.829" style="s2">See my kinematic model very</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.279" end="02:28:35.279" style="s2">So right that right it Airy that wrong</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.960" end="02:28:43.589" style="s2">My multiply the pose the previous frame with the inverse of the pose from the frame two frames ago</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.100" end="02:28:47.220" style="s2">And then I got that velocity is pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.939" end="02:28:56.578" style="s2">Like the map looks better when I let it optimize pose but like that kind of looks like crap</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.880" end="02:29:00.599" style="s2">My filtering is probably not that good. I don&#39;t read the Orson</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.399" end="02:29:09.149" style="s2">That&#39;s why I better get rid of that added points print it spam</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.279" end="02:29:18.140" style="s2">Window back to 20 the window the optimizer kind of toys over so it doesn&#39;t get really slow</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.210" end="02:29:28.970" style="s2">Is this all right good check to have</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.181" end="02:29:38.990" style="s2">And that&#39;s scale so I don&#39;t really know what to do about that a</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.460" end="02:29:47.270" style="s2">Kinematic model just assumes constant velocity</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.510" end="02:30:11.510" style="s2">And I said you want paper</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.030" end="02:30:27.539" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna stop streaming a little earlier today. I said get to work early go work to go</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.180" end="02:30:36.900" style="s2">Mavs initialization, okay, we&#39;re doing okay about that</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.360" end="02:30:45.569" style="s2">Features local mapping. Hmm. Ah</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.950" end="02:30:57.659" style="s2">A representative or of descriptor D which is the Associated or descriptor whose Hamming distance is minimum</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.750" end="02:31:00.780" style="s2">with respect to all other</p>
<p begin="02:31:01.450" end="02:31:04.049" style="s2">associated descriptors in the key frames</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.040" end="02:31:10.560" style="s2">Which the point is observed well, that&#39;s interesting. Okay. That&#39;s a cute way of doing it</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.561" end="02:31:12.780" style="s2">I remember when we were talking about how to do the Hamming distance</p>
<p begin="02:31:13.540" end="02:31:15.839" style="s2">so they just pick one that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.490" end="02:31:20.490" style="s2">That&#39;s representative</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.800" end="02:31:30.450" style="s2">Maximum d max and minimum diamond point in reserve according to scale variants of it&#39;s a warped features. That&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.590" end="02:31:38.070" style="s2">Counter pose, which is a rich body transformation that transforms from the world to the camera coordinate system</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.750" end="02:31:44.820" style="s2">Intrinsic so the origin is trying to frame so we&#39;re doing bars very similar</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.551" end="02:32:02.081" style="s2">Lawson emotion model we&#39;re doing that. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.480" end="02:32:13.149" style="s2">Okay, well that&#39;s interesting so they&#39;re using the velocity model and then using that for search by projection</p>
<p begin="02:32:15.081" end="02:32:20.770" style="s2">They&#39;re doing their pose optimizer after search by projection you try that</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.131" end="02:32:40.131" style="s2">Weird it seemed better</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.400" end="02:32:47.060" style="s2">Well, no like it&#39;s hard to quantify better we should have it actually saved the pose then we can use the compare script I</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.000" end="02:33:00.440" style="s2">Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s better but yeah, so that&#39;s interesting they&#39;re talking about how to do their search by rejecting</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.971" end="02:33:10.971" style="s2">House just cuz I had graduated I know</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.301" end="02:33:17.301" style="s2">It&#39;s messing up the first frame</p>
<p begin="02:33:21.710" end="02:33:23.710" style="s2">No, that&#39;s the same pretty much</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.510" end="02:33:28.510" style="s2">All right, if tracking is lost</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.110" end="02:33:33.519" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, we don&#39;t have to worry about that track local map</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.640" end="02:33:39.640" style="s2">If you have a point projection X in the current frame just guard if it lies outside the image</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.220" end="02:33:42.340" style="s2">Frame, so actually that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="02:33:45.740" end="02:33:51.369" style="s2">Compute the angle between the current viewing ray and the map point mean viewing direction we don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.210" end="02:33:59.769" style="s2">Compute the distance from the map point to the camera center discard of its out of the scale avarage of the map. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:34:03.260" end="02:34:05.260" style="s2">This is interesting</p>
<p begin="02:34:06.380" end="02:34:11.920" style="s2">Representative descriptor d of map point with still on natural features in the frame of the predicted scale in near access</p>
<p begin="02:34:11.920" end="02:34:16.839" style="s2">So that&#39;s a search by projection. The camera pose is finally optimized with all of that points found in the frame</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.750" end="02:34:24.370" style="s2">So we&#39;re doing a pose optimization</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.220" end="02:34:30.220" style="s2">Only with the points</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.589" end="02:34:46.209" style="s2">We&#39;re doing it only with the points that are matched by the brute force majeure. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.350" end="02:34:53.350" style="s2">Here we go, they didn&#39;t - calling here</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.539" end="02:34:59.979" style="s2">The tracking must find the point in at least 25% of the frames on which it&#39;s predicted to be visible. Wow, that&#39;s fancy</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.529" end="02:35:04.958" style="s2">If more than one keyframe has passed from map point creation</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.299" end="02:35:08.889" style="s2">It must be observed from at least three keyframes</p>
<p begin="02:35:15.020" end="02:35:19.509" style="s2">Local bundle adjustment discards outlier observations, so that&#39;s exactly what we do here</p>
<p begin="02:35:22.310" end="02:35:24.310" style="s2">Man why are discard are not good</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.699" end="02:35:30.699" style="s2">This bug alright bugs here</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.100" end="02:36:00.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s one a lot of error. Is that a lot? No, no, I</p>
<p begin="02:36:01.970" end="02:36:05.320" style="s2">Don&#39;t think so. It has pixels, right?</p>
<p begin="02:36:06.740" end="02:36:11.740" style="s2">You keep your user in pixel space. So it&#39;s the norm in pixels K. So I doesn&#39;t sound like a lot of error</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.620" end="02:36:20.620" style="s2">Do that but</p>
<p begin="02:36:25.490" end="02:36:32.049" style="s2">Those looking better actually, I&#39;m really just guarding a lot of crap those crap shows up</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.591" end="02:36:47.591" style="s2">Not really helping</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.950" end="02:36:54.610" style="s2">Here&#39;s discarding a lot of points now, but I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="02:36:55.881" end="02:36:59.290" style="s2">Mean, maybe that&#39;s the wrong error metric as well, right?</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.690" end="02:37:04.090" style="s2">Because if your things are moving further, you&#39;d expect the pixel to be higher</p>
<p begin="02:37:05.181" end="02:37:08.801" style="s2">I&#39;m glad to jump to down there. I love it. Nice job slim</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.070" end="02:37:15.279" style="s2">Why is it so noisy like that</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.790" end="02:37:22.300" style="s2">Why is that frame there bad frame be more straight like go go put the other frames</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.360" end="02:37:28.360" style="s2">With the ground</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.540" end="02:37:34.540" style="s2">No issues</p>
<p begin="02:37:44.931" end="02:37:46.931" style="s2">Especially disable the optimizer</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.610" end="02:37:58.900" style="s2">Okay, look at those beautiful frames they&#39;re beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:38:00.740" end="02:38:02.740" style="s2">That&#39;s what I want my frames to look like</p>
<p begin="02:38:03.980" end="02:38:06.999" style="s2">Hey that velocity model works really well, I</p>
<p begin="02:38:14.091" end="02:38:19.180" style="s2">Want my frames to look like that so good looking</p>
<p begin="02:38:23.030" end="02:38:27.640" style="s2">Well, yeah, I mean I could add something to the optimizer to tell it not to do that but like</p>
<p begin="02:38:28.610" end="02:38:30.610" style="s2">just have to</p>
<p begin="02:38:31.101" end="02:38:36.490" style="s2">Like that noise as a result of noisy observations. I should just fix the observations</p>
<p begin="02:38:58.101" end="02:39:00.101" style="s2">Look at all the inner is being discarded</p>
<p begin="02:39:03.021" end="02:39:07.570" style="s2">It&#39;s a lot the threshold I can change</p>
<p begin="02:39:19.479" end="02:39:21.479" style="s2">Largest functions being discarded</p>
<p begin="02:39:28.970" end="02:39:34.630" style="s2">Okay, there&#39;s a lot of noise there but I lowered that was more discarded</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.819" end="02:39:42.819" style="s2">No, it&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:39:50.270" end="02:39:52.270" style="s2">Better</p>
<p begin="02:40:03.770" end="02:40:06.279" style="s2">Wow, that&#39;s what was making it slow though, that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="02:40:18.020" end="02:40:20.020" style="s2">And see the crap showing up here now</p>
<p begin="02:40:40.451" end="02:40:42.451" style="s2">No faster than so fast now</p>
<p begin="02:40:48.249" end="02:40:50.458" style="s2">We are triangulating trust me</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.370" end="02:41:11.729" style="s2">You know just making things a little faster that doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="02:41:26.860" end="02:41:28.860" style="s2">Be more like the poses</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.351" end="02:41:40.351" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="02:42:04.550" end="02:42:10.479" style="s2">Look at the high quality, you know, I have no idea that is that good cause I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:42:13.340" end="02:42:15.670" style="s2">So I&#39;m never using that same XYZ dataset</p>
<p begin="02:42:38.141" end="02:42:40.141" style="s2">For one XYZ</p>
<p begin="02:42:46.450" end="02:42:48.450" style="s2">Scale</p>
<p begin="02:42:50.381" end="02:42:54.660" style="s2">It&#39;s impossible to see anything and all the points show up way too close</p>
<p begin="02:43:03.221" end="02:43:09.480" style="s2">Track a single point over time. Yeah, maybe we&#39;ll do that tomorrow</p>
<p begin="02:43:32.320" end="02:43:38.070" style="s2">Starting to chop best stuff on kitty</p>
<p begin="02:43:44.500" end="02:43:48.060" style="s2">You know, we won&#39;t we will lower this do the next trials like very</p>
<p begin="02:44:03.280" end="02:44:09.630" style="s2">Problem I here to talk about comma don&#39;t cut the fish lamp</p>
<p begin="02:44:18.881" end="02:44:23.010" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty good though, maybe fast</p>
<p begin="02:44:29.070" end="02:44:31.070" style="s2">Looking happier, though</p>
<p begin="02:44:36.090" end="02:44:41.330" style="s2">Leave look at look at how much more straight it is here. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s nonstop on another business</p>
<p begin="02:44:55.880" end="02:44:58.639" style="s2">Oh, so these are getting rejected for some reason</p>
<p begin="02:45:00.060" end="02:45:02.060" style="s2">can&#39;t understand why I</p>
<p begin="02:45:03.090" end="02:45:06.679" style="s2">Worry that they&#39;re being rejected by that clause that I say might be broken</p>
<p begin="02:45:08.550" end="02:45:10.550" style="s2">If you have these aren&#39;t in the map I</p>
<p begin="02:45:13.470" end="02:45:15.470" style="s2">Had anything to nap for a while</p>
<p begin="02:45:16.470" end="02:45:18.470" style="s2">What some?</p>
<p begin="02:45:19.140" end="02:45:21.140" style="s2">Yeah, it would actually be pretty easy to uh</p>
<p begin="02:45:22.020" end="02:45:26.149" style="s2">To add one on one camera. There&#39;s nothing in here that assumes one camera</p>
<p begin="02:45:27.360" end="02:45:29.360" style="s2">Figure out that checks actually wrong</p>
<p begin="02:45:40.050" end="02:45:42.740" style="s2">We saw points weren&#39;t getting added past a certain point</p>
<p begin="02:45:48.810" end="02:45:51.110" style="s2">Once we got once we got a bit more around this Bend</p>
<p begin="02:46:07.470" end="02:46:14.370" style="s2">You know, like if they have black dots like that I mean they&#39;re not being into the map for some reason that all looks good</p>
<p begin="02:46:17.590" end="02:46:20.549" style="s2">Humans vaguely generate depth to eyes</p>
<p begin="02:46:21.880" end="02:46:24.360" style="s2">uuugh vastly overestimate how much that matters</p>
<p begin="02:46:26.200" end="02:46:30.240" style="s2">No, but look they&#39;re not being out of the map again, look at these points, they&#39;re not being out of the map</p>
<p begin="02:46:31.990" end="02:46:33.990" style="s2">Why</p>
<p begin="02:46:35.050" end="02:46:39.810" style="s2">Why have I no points here those are good matches I</p>
<p begin="02:46:43.180" end="02:46:45.180" style="s2">Don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="02:46:51.561" end="02:46:53.591" style="s2">Which check is rejecting them</p>
<p begin="02:47:00.370" end="02:47:05.309" style="s2">Boys let&#39;s do a frame on that. Let&#39;s first see if it&#39;s a frame problem. So what if I do this C equals 200?</p>
<p begin="02:47:12.290" end="02:47:14.290" style="s2">That work didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="02:47:27.319" end="02:47:29.319" style="s2">Now</p>
<p begin="02:47:33.750" end="02:47:36.800" style="s2">When I run the whole thing if they stop getting at it past a certain point</p>
<p begin="02:47:38.280" end="02:47:40.880" style="s2">Even without that checks. I don&#39;t think that check is wrong</p>
<p begin="02:47:47.341" end="02:47:49.341" style="s2">Could this check Bureau</p>
<p begin="02:47:51.480" end="02:47:54.050" style="s2">Work with my triangulate. Oh just really not like</p>
<p begin="02:47:57.030" end="02:47:59.030" style="s2">Thing is once the poses get large</p>
<p begin="02:48:01.261" end="02:48:03.261" style="s2">That&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="02:48:03.721" end="02:48:05.900" style="s2">We can pretty easily just keep it read golf</p>
<p begin="02:48:08.431" end="02:48:10.431" style="s2">Just effectively what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="02:48:25.930" end="02:48:30.479" style="s2">Yeah, see look these aren&#39;t getting at it anymore all those points are crap</p>
<p begin="02:48:36.880" end="02:48:38.880" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="02:48:46.750" end="02:48:48.750" style="s2">Pose</p>
<p begin="02:48:49.750" end="02:48:54.149" style="s2">Pose pose MP dot fun pose</p>
<p begin="02:48:58.060" end="02:49:00.060" style="s2">In to dock pose</p>
<p begin="02:49:03.760" end="02:49:05.760" style="s2">Elbows here</p>
<p begin="02:49:06.220" end="02:49:08.220" style="s2">or here</p>
<p begin="02:49:09.850" end="02:49:12.359" style="s2">Call this point low fall</p>
<p begin="02:49:32.430" end="02:49:36.080" style="s2">Now we&#39;ll say points for D and B dot</p>
<p begin="02:49:43.410" end="02:49:45.410" style="s2">One dot pose</p>
<p begin="02:49:47.970" end="02:49:51.800" style="s2">That&#39;s not right because that&#39;s actually putting them in do that</p>
<p begin="02:49:57.780" end="02:49:59.780" style="s2">Is that more correct</p>
<p begin="02:50:05.189" end="02:50:11.989" style="s2">Yeah, I mean the question is should we triangulate them in a local we can triangulate them in a local coordinate frame</p>
<p begin="02:50:12.780" end="02:50:17.629" style="s2">Where instead of trying in the global coordinate frame that could be the cause of these issues?</p>
<p begin="02:50:19.710" end="02:50:20.880" style="s2">The only</p>
<p begin="02:50:20.880" end="02:50:25.219" style="s2">Point I have against this is I don&#39;t feel that orb slim. Does it this way?</p>
<p begin="02:50:25.220" end="02:50:28.280" style="s2">I feel like I&#39;ve read the orb some code and it doesn&#39;t do it this way</p>
<p begin="02:50:29.939" end="02:50:33.439" style="s2">But otherwise, I really have no explanation for why they should be different</p>
<p begin="02:50:36.180" end="02:50:42.769" style="s2">Okay, I think this through a little bit more let&#39;s try this</p>
<p begin="02:50:54.580" end="02:51:00.450" style="s2">Let&#39;s put this here and for this one</p>
<p begin="02:51:06.160" end="02:51:08.400" style="s2">Let&#39;s solve for R T here basically</p>
<p begin="02:51:12.250" end="02:51:14.339" style="s2">So we&#39;re going to say f1 dot pose</p>
<p begin="02:51:31.840" end="02:51:33.840" style="s2">That isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="02:51:35.380" end="02:51:40.589" style="s2">Thank you shit, man, and I don&#39;t know why I stream my streams try someone to talk to I do this</p>
<p begin="02:51:45.970" end="02:51:48.330" style="s2">Chestnut calm you won&#39;t find it out</p>
<p begin="02:51:50.710" end="02:51:53.730" style="s2">I&#39;m not that good. It&#39;s not inspiring. Fuck you</p>
<p begin="02:51:55.870" end="02:51:58.650" style="s2">Know this is fucking bullshit man. I</p>
<p begin="02:52:02.561" end="02:52:09.030" style="s2">Hate inspiring shit inspire people to do what just go do things if you want to do things do things you&#39;ll need to be inspired</p>
<p begin="02:52:16.761" end="02:52:22.390" style="s2">Don&#39;t care what would I do with money? I can&#39;t buy a better laptop. They don&#39;t have one yet</p>
<p begin="02:52:23.360" end="02:52:27.340" style="s2">Can&#39;t buy faster internet. I mean, yeah, maybe it&#39;s like extremely high thing</p>
<p begin="02:52:27.341" end="02:52:28.280" style="s2">but then I feel like</p>
<p begin="02:52:28.280" end="02:52:34.869" style="s2">Deal with the guy digging out my street for fiber and my neighbors wouldn&#39;t like me and then I gotta just deal with things</p>
<p begin="02:52:34.870" end="02:52:36.830" style="s2">Right, that&#39;s a lot after</p>
<p begin="02:52:36.830" end="02:52:38.830" style="s2">your deal with things like</p>
<p begin="02:52:47.030" end="02:52:52.360" style="s2">Okay, you know what my job is guys as manage people like I don&#39;t code at work</p>
<p begin="02:52:54.620" end="02:52:56.620" style="s2">Manages terrible</p>
<p begin="02:52:57.380" end="02:53:04.630" style="s2">The here I get the program I get I get the program and then in the peace and quiet of my lovely room</p>
<p begin="02:53:04.971" end="02:53:06.561" style="s2">well drink</p>
<p begin="02:53:06.561" end="02:53:08.561" style="s2">yerba, MA pays</p>
<p begin="02:53:10.011" end="02:53:15.280" style="s2">It&#39;s just a nice relaxing way to start the morning I don&#39;t know today wasn&#39;t very relaxing now, I don&#39;t know why I</p>
<p begin="02:53:25.761" end="02:53:27.761" style="s2">Feel like this is what I just wrote I</p>
<p begin="02:53:29.960" end="02:53:31.960" style="s2">Don&#39;t know exactly the way to work</p>
<p begin="02:53:32.960" end="02:53:37.629" style="s2">but okay, so I take the f1 pose and I remove the f2 pose and then I&#39;m left with NPI for</p>
<p begin="02:53:38.480" end="02:53:42.430" style="s2">All right, and then I have local points and I can get that check</p>
<p begin="02:53:44.271" end="02:53:46.271" style="s2">And then I</p>
<p begin="02:53:48.801" end="02:53:50.980" style="s2">Know my code is shit. I know all the</p>
<p begin="02:53:54.051" end="02:54:01.450" style="s2">Points or D. Basically, I think I just want to apply F to pose. That&#39;s what he took out, right</p>
<p begin="02:54:08.750" end="02:54:12.670" style="s2">Back oh</p>
<p begin="02:54:18.651" end="02:54:20.651" style="s2">Cool alright</p>
<p begin="02:54:25.281" end="02:54:27.281" style="s2">Let&#39;s see if the problem still happens. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:54:29.271" end="02:54:34.751" style="s2">The points in their own place. Wow, I don&#39;t know how this works at all. It&#39;s putting all the points over there</p>
<p begin="02:54:36.351" end="02:54:38.351" style="s2">That&#39;s just good I did something backwards</p>
<p begin="02:54:52.281" end="02:54:55.870" style="s2">First you don&#39;t succeed like convert one of the matrixes and maybe I&#39;ll fix it</p>
<p begin="02:54:58.911" end="02:55:02.890" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s see if the points turn black again or if they stay a good color</p>
<p begin="02:55:06.201" end="02:55:10.151" style="s2">So we go around this turn but now these numbers are getting big right</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.401" end="02:55:13.660" style="s2">Thank you might just be like numerical instability of the DLT. I</p>
<p begin="02:55:16.461" end="02:55:22.871" style="s2">Swear orb slam does it the other way like I&#39;ve read the code not this face. Is that ok fine</p>
<p begin="02:55:25.041" end="02:55:27.041" style="s2">Who might argue with what works</p>
<p begin="02:55:36.790" end="02:55:43.640" style="s2">Looks great look about beautiful. Look at that beautiful math. I love that map so nice</p>
<p begin="02:56:13.970" end="02:56:16.449" style="s2">All right guys it&#39;s so fine points</p>
<p begin="02:56:24.949" end="02:56:30.908" style="s2">Do in</p>
<p begin="02:56:49.101" end="02:56:51.770" style="s2">I don&#39;t want that exits</p>
<p begin="02:56:57.240" end="02:56:59.240" style="s2">Like an that one just it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="02:57:05.460" end="02:57:10.400" style="s2">Use different sizes and colors for quaternions. I promise you are in</p>
<p begin="02:57:14.311" end="02:57:16.311" style="s2">Pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:57:24.181" end="02:57:27.080" style="s2">Hire you are you good do know things I</p>
<p begin="02:57:28.261" end="02:57:36.170" style="s2">tell you the interviews for comma are basically is sit you down and I ask you questions and know things and</p>
<p begin="02:57:38.311" end="02:57:39.980" style="s2">That if you don&#39;t know things I mean</p>
<p begin="02:57:39.980" end="02:57:44.359" style="s2">That&#39;s okay to not know things the first time I don&#39;t like tell you something and then when I bring it up again ten minutes</p>
<p begin="02:57:44.360" end="02:57:46.879" style="s2">Later, like no like did you learn?</p>
<p begin="02:57:48.840" end="02:57:51.560" style="s2">It kicks my buggy code man submit a FOIA request I</p>
<p begin="02:57:52.891" end="02:57:57.830" style="s2">Fix the bug man. What are you talking about? This isn&#39;t funny anymore. I mean there&#39;s improvements</p>
<p begin="02:57:57.830" end="02:58:00.410" style="s2">Like we may both good bugs sure this likes</p>
<p begin="02:58:05.370" end="02:58:08.209" style="s2">Alright we try it on Ohio. Let&#39;s try it in, Ohio</p>
<p begin="02:58:12.240" end="02:58:14.240" style="s2">Ohio is always a great test</p>
<p begin="02:58:18.170" end="02:58:23.019" style="s2">That&#39;s not right I just think go that way it goes the other way I stopped at battle I oh</p>
<p begin="02:58:27.620" end="02:58:29.620" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:58:30.560" end="02:58:33.820" style="s2">The wrong initialization is a common problem in the knock door slam</p>
<p begin="02:58:35.870" end="02:58:37.870" style="s2">Yeah map, Ohio, bro</p>
<p begin="02:58:45.950" end="02:58:51.219" style="s2">No, I don&#39;t care how old you are no one gets any special treatment I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="02:58:51.770" end="02:58:54.910" style="s2">No, I came from difficult circumstances all I&#39;m young. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:58:56.120" end="02:59:01.509" style="s2">My dog. No, I don&#39;t care for your dog, but can you program that&#39;s what matters do you know? Thanks</p>

<p begin="02:59:13.910" end="02:59:15.890" style="s2">What</p>
<p begin="02:59:15.890" end="02:59:17.890" style="s2">quaternions, bro</p>
<p begin="02:59:18.380" end="02:59:20.380" style="s2">Are you kind of music</p>
<p begin="02:59:22.370" end="02:59:28.120" style="s2">See I don&#39;t see any quaternions on the sign though, it&#39;s that&#39;s a pretty good map of Ohio if I&#39;ve ever seen one I</p>
<p begin="02:59:32.479" end="02:59:35.739" style="s2">Found this video on YouTube. It&#39;s a video of some guy driving to, Ohio</p>
<p begin="02:59:39.440" end="02:59:42.339" style="s2">Looks pretty good to me. Let it map Ohio for a bit more</p>
<p begin="02:59:45.500" end="02:59:49.629" style="s2">When I hired me at 17, yeah, I probably would he&#39;s pretty good. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:59:52.700" end="02:59:54.700" style="s2">And I wouldn&#39;t let him like code things</p>
<p begin="03:00:01.400" end="03:00:06.669" style="s2">He&#39;s a quality shit, this is best map Ohio I&#39;ve ever seen just putting that out there this is a pretty good, Ohio</p>
<p begin="03:00:11.840" end="03:00:17.320" style="s2">Remember when we were at that Burger King with the Burger King signs right there right there it says like whopper eat whopper</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.220" end="03:00:21.760" style="s2">More the green circles called they called it warm features</p>
<p begin="03:00:23.810" end="03:00:25.839" style="s2">They&#39;re not good tourney opens prowl</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.060" end="03:00:31.060" style="s2">It only gets a little slower</p>
<p begin="03:00:34.699" end="03:00:36.699" style="s2">Switch</p>
<p begin="03:00:49.010" end="03:00:51.010" style="s2">SiC Mapple, Ohio</p>
<p begin="03:00:58.699" end="03:01:05.229" style="s2">Can you map in real time it&#39;s slightly Daffy far for real time. This one&#39;s almost slow down. All right stop</p>
<p begin="03:01:12.079" end="03:01:16.659" style="s2">So uniting new points, I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know why it slow</p>
<p begin="03:01:30.960" end="03:01:36.859" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s a little slow if I tell me about flame may you know, we&#39;ll do tomorrow we&#39;ll profile</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.620" end="03:01:41.419" style="s2">Tomorrow we&#39;ll focus entirely on speak. How about that? Sound good?</p>
<p begin="03:01:45.930" end="03:01:51.139" style="s2">Tomorrow that&#39;s my promise to you guys. Well know we&#39;ll see what time I get home tonight</p>
<p begin="03:01:54.330" end="03:01:56.330" style="s2">But I will try to do that tomorrow</p>
<p begin="03:01:59.010" end="03:02:06.530" style="s2">Reconstruct surfaces from the points whatever you hear by that I have some local window, right?</p>
<p begin="03:02:25.350" end="03:02:31.340" style="s2">Those sites like you can see it right there beautiful. Look at them traffic lights like you say went down the map</p>
<p begin="03:02:33.480" end="03:02:37.759" style="s2">Map Ohio&#39;s like now we know we&#39;re alive great slam</p>
<p begin="03:02:41.940" end="03:02:44.239" style="s2">So tomorrow we&#39;ll work on speed and</p>
<p begin="03:02:45.270" end="03:02:50.000" style="s2">Then the day after that will work. We&#39;ll make the visualizer better</p>
<p begin="03:02:50.190" end="03:02:53.989" style="s2">We&#39;ll actually have it like take some texture from the image of the stuff instead of just a point color</p>
<p begin="03:02:58.500" end="03:03:01.099" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna make a turn a turn you&#39;d be cool. Oh</p>
<p begin="03:03:02.400" end="03:03:07.219" style="s2">No, maybe that&#39;s know some people in Ohio though when I was there like once I hadn&#39;t seen many people make turns</p>
<p begin="03:03:12.390" end="03:03:15.890" style="s2">And you guys know there&#39;s only four words to so much better than other backwards</p>
<p begin="03:03:30.199" end="03:03:35.649" style="s2">I&#39;m not reconstructing surfaces office. So annoying little texture on the road</p>
<p begin="03:03:37.279" end="03:03:40.779" style="s2">I&#39;m not writing. This is feature slam. It&#39;s not that slam</p>
<p begin="03:03:43.100" end="03:03:46.749" style="s2">No, I mean maybe we can start to add some leg maybe we can start to make it more dense</p>
<p begin="03:03:48.709" end="03:03:54.338" style="s2">Um, but I think a focus on speed first, let&#39;s figure out why it&#39;s slow like why is it slow right now, I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="03:03:54.949" end="03:03:58.538" style="s2">That&#39;s because I was probably cause it&#39;s true all I know why it&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="03:03:59.060" end="03:04:02.649" style="s2">It&#39;s because it&#39;s searching by projection things that are behind it</p>
<p begin="03:04:04.399" end="03:04:06.399" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="03:04:08.270" end="03:04:11.589" style="s2">Search by projection less</p>
<p begin="03:04:17.719" end="03:04:21.309" style="s2">Right because we&#39;re actually searching by projection we&#39;re searching every frame</p>
<p begin="03:04:21.799" end="03:04:26.919" style="s2">We&#39;re searching every point in the map to see if that&#39;s visible from my frame. You don&#39;t have to do that</p>
<p begin="03:04:26.919" end="03:04:28.919" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that at all</p>
<p begin="03:04:31.879" end="03:04:38.199" style="s2">Okay, so we can search by projection less stupidly that&#39;s gonna give us speed because like it&#39;s fast at first then it just gets slow</p>
<p begin="03:04:44.569" end="03:04:49.809" style="s2">Okay, so we will roam file with flame</p>
<p begin="03:04:52.399" end="03:04:56.828" style="s2">Search projection less stupidly because I think all the time right not yet is being spent on the search by projection</p>
<p begin="03:05:01.729" end="03:05:07.508" style="s2">No, why does optimizing as always our stuff what&#39;s a big map of Ohio</p>
<p begin="03:05:11.659" end="03:05:15.069" style="s2">Do you guys remember how this used to work remember how bad it used to think?</p>
<p begin="03:05:29.220" end="03:05:37.109" style="s2">Ah, let&#39;s brew it off this is pretty soft. Okay Wow, it&#39;s Inger the second of frame</p>
<p begin="03:05:41.060" end="03:05:47.480" style="s2">You see even pose maybe we can yeah, don&#39;t add all</p>
<p begin="03:05:49.470" end="03:05:51.470" style="s2">Points to</p>
<p begin="03:05:58.320" end="03:06:00.320" style="s2">Pose at least</p>
<p begin="03:06:03.240" end="03:06:07.490" style="s2">Yeah, so we don&#39;t say that all the points out relation graph or pose cuz I propose optimizers taking time</p>
<p begin="03:06:09.090" end="03:06:12.019" style="s2">Well, yeah, I mean so we can look into work</p>
<p begin="03:06:12.020" end="03:06:17.270" style="s2">So I was doing this like clever thing where they like keep track of like which frames are likely the points to be found in</p>
<p begin="03:06:17.670" end="03:06:19.670" style="s2">We can do the same thing</p>
<p begin="03:06:21.030" end="03:06:23.809" style="s2">Well good look that&#39;s your jacking those points so good</p>
<p begin="03:06:25.260" end="03:06:28.550" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a lot of this a lot of features. Are that cinema?</p>
<p begin="03:06:28.580" end="03:06:32.839" style="s2">Oh, yeah search by projection quality that you can&#39;t do that with or begin search by projection</p>
<p begin="03:06:55.290" end="03:06:57.540" style="s2">a bomb at cinema</p>
<p begin="03:07:00.250" end="03:07:03.150" style="s2">Alright so it can scale better with that</p>
<p begin="03:07:06.190" end="03:07:09.480" style="s2">Down sample or points that are super close together. I already do that</p>
<p begin="03:07:09.480" end="03:07:13.079" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you want you want you want to make the map less dense? I don&#39;t think we want to do that</p>
<p begin="03:07:14.710" end="03:07:18.360" style="s2">Like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem we&#39;re not getting look we&#39;re not getting that many matches</p>
<p begin="03:07:22.210" end="03:07:26.339" style="s2">I&#39;m actually printing out that I&#39;m a matches for getting somebody&#39;s might just be a lot of matches but</p>
<p begin="03:07:28.750" end="03:07:33.660" style="s2">Yeah, I mean, I think the problem is just the work of the love-u-lator they go bad look at that cinema</p>
<p begin="03:07:41.830" end="03:07:46.770" style="s2">Use a higher resolution video there&#39;s a good drive through, New York</p>
<p begin="03:07:52.540" end="03:07:54.540" style="s2">What&#39;s the license on us</p>
<p begin="03:07:56.061" end="03:08:02.410" style="s2">It&#39;s long, hey, I&#39;m happy to try a different video, but there&#39;s a few things that it can have</p>
<p begin="03:08:05.780" end="03:08:12.190" style="s2">So this might have cuts the can of cuts it has to be Creative Commons license that it has to be relatively short</p>
<p begin="03:08:13.430" end="03:08:15.430" style="s2">However, this doesn&#39;t have cots. Oh</p>
<p begin="03:08:18.260" end="03:08:20.260" style="s2">Man but like this is a busy environment</p>
<p begin="03:08:22.370" end="03:08:24.370" style="s2">Which is gonna make</p>

<p begin="03:08:38.230" end="03:08:38.620" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="03:08:38.620" end="03:08:44.589" style="s2">Like I wanted to after you get this to work what I really want to happen because I want this to do like a dense</p>

<p begin="03:08:48.710" end="03:08:53.320" style="s2">I want to do like dense surface reconstruction. So it&#39;s like a super dense slam</p>
<p begin="03:08:55.670" end="03:08:59.020" style="s2">What&#39;s the license on it, is it long enough that&#39;s too long</p>
<p begin="03:08:59.230" end="03:09:03.159" style="s2">I mean like a two-minute Creative Commons license video and we could try it right now</p>

<p begin="03:21:46.570" end="03:21:50.820" style="s2">Won&#39;t work on the turn. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know twitch slams not really been tested on turns before</p>
<p begin="03:21:53.920" end="03:21:55.920" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t make a turn here, right</p>
<p begin="03:21:57.430" end="03:22:02.370" style="s2">House is too slow. This is egregiously slow tomorrow speed guys. I</p>
<p begin="03:22:04.000" end="03:22:07.469" style="s2">Know I&#39;m getting worms on the texts, but it&#39;s good. It&#39;s rejecting them</p>
<p begin="03:22:08.530" end="03:22:13.770" style="s2">Or it&#39;s saying are at infinity which I mean it&#39;s kind of stupid and it&#39;s gonna be annoying if we try to get rotation</p>
<p begin="03:22:14.350" end="03:22:17.070" style="s2">Actually, they&#39;re uh, they&#39;re black. So it means that I&#39;ve been used</p>
<p begin="03:22:20.021" end="03:22:22.920" style="s2">Good a good twitch slam good twitch slam</p>
<p begin="03:22:25.210" end="03:22:30.929" style="s2">Alright come on turn who&#39;s excited for the turn. Are you gonna turn here? I thought it turns here</p>
<p begin="03:22:40.160" end="03:22:42.339" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s the guy who runs through the green light</p>
<p begin="03:22:44.990" end="03:22:46.990" style="s2">Yeah, it only uses one car</p>
<p begin="03:22:49.220" end="03:22:55.450" style="s2">The GPU I mean we can try using the GPU plus a little it&#39;s tomorrow</p>
<p begin="03:22:55.450" end="03:22:59.799" style="s2">We&#39;ll profile and figure out what&#39;s slow we&#39;ll figure out a breakdown of the time</p>
<p begin="03:23:00.680" end="03:23:06.640" style="s2">And we&#39;ll think about using the GPU. I don&#39;t know really GPU for like is it the optimizer? That&#39;s slow?</p>
<p begin="03:23:06.771" end="03:23:11.891" style="s2">I just don&#39;t like the Python II crap. Yeah, I know. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="03:23:11.891" end="03:23:15.730" style="s2">You guys I&#39;m poor donate donate to my twitch stream so I could buy a new computer</p>
<p begin="03:23:19.280" end="03:23:24.549" style="s2">Twitch lab hi. Come on make it turn its gonna turn bros. You think the turns gonna work?</p>
<p begin="03:23:25.940" end="03:23:30.339" style="s2">Yeah, give it I give it a good 30% chance of working good</p>
<p begin="03:23:32.690" end="03:23:36.520" style="s2">All right, you see how if we slowed down you feel like there was a lot of speed there and then we slow down</p>
<p begin="03:23:37.250" end="03:23:43.240" style="s2">Slow and the old friends are really dense. So when I using or if slim uses keyframes, we&#39;re not using keyframing strategy</p>
<p begin="03:23:43.240" end="03:23:45.240" style="s2">We&#39;re at you&#39;re just putting every frame in there</p>
<p begin="03:23:45.710" end="03:23:50.469" style="s2">Which I kind of like I don&#39;t really like that giddyup keyframes because the new things not like optimized perfectly</p>
<p begin="03:23:52.460" end="03:23:59.530" style="s2">Sure epsilon has good reasons for keyframes, but I don&#39;t really like them. Oh look. Look is that turning is that turning? What up?</p>
<p begin="03:23:59.530" end="03:24:01.530" style="s2">I think it&#39;s turning. Oh</p>
<p begin="03:24:03.290" end="03:24:10.299" style="s2">My god, this is horrendously slow. Yeah. Yeah could be I wasn&#39;t a twitch thought I&#39;m gonna be a twitch stop</p>
<p begin="03:24:12.500" end="03:24:18.790" style="s2">Smashed it up a pun. Yeah, hit that subscribe. You can&#39;t even subscribe. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t subscribe but apparently can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:24:19.370" end="03:24:21.549" style="s2">Because I didn&#39;t like sign up to be a twitch</p>
<p begin="03:24:22.550" end="03:24:24.550" style="s2">affiliate or whatever I</p>
<p begin="03:24:28.970" end="03:24:35.110" style="s2">Don&#39;t know man, the world is full of scam you just seem so scammy like a twitch affiliate</p>
<p begin="03:24:44.850" end="03:24:49.519" style="s2">It&#39;s still funny I agreed that a bit which stop don&#39;t get twitch not what do they do?</p>
<p begin="03:24:49.520" end="03:24:52.220" style="s2">I should watch them twitch that themes and do what they do</p>
<p begin="03:24:52.770" end="03:24:58.970" style="s2">And see if it works for me and when it doesn&#39;t work for me, I&#39;ll scream about sexism that always works. Oh</p>
<p begin="03:25:03.090" end="03:25:09.410" style="s2">It&#39;s turning it&#39;s turning at a very slow. Oh my god. Okay. That was the worst turn I&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="03:25:10.830" end="03:25:13.999" style="s2">Well, I think it&#39;s a few things. I think my vocal is wrong</p>
<p begin="03:25:14.000" end="03:25:17.929" style="s2">I mean that was a 90-degree turn and twitch slam turned a whole twenty degrees</p>
<p begin="03:25:20.220" end="03:25:22.220" style="s2">Put my leg on my chair</p>
