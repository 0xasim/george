<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">so one thing that i&#39;m going to reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">this this is a surgical mask it does</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">absolutely nothing to prevent the spread</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">um after 30 minutes these things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">just damp saturated</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">you&#39;re breathing in the same number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">air i am definitely</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">with the birthday party those in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">birthday party know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">this does nothing this is dumb as</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s advocating the wearing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">these masks is a moron</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">this is a virtue signaling device and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">should be referred to as a face</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">diaper even dumber than this and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">even own one because it&#39;s dumber and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">does even less is a cloth mask</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">if you&#39;d like to prevent coronavirus now</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">this again is only going to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">you from getting it it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">prevent you from spreading it because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">has a different n95 masks do this too</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">it has a separate intake path from</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">exhalation path</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">so the intake goes through this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">this is a face</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">diaper i don&#39;t wear diapers on my ass</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">and i do not wear diapers</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">no the masks are not better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">the masks do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">and you have to be uncomfortable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">wear a stupid mask</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">well they remind people of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">um i mean this is just one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">biggest pieces</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">of misinformation i&#39;ve seen online about</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">remember how they didn&#39;t recommend masks</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">because the truth is well so even</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">stupider than a surgical mask</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">they&#39;re not better than nothing well</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">okay this may be better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">but what&#39;s not better than nothing is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">cloth mask</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">see this this is a pair of boxers right</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">this is effectively what a cloth mask is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">made out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">i can see the holes in it you can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">holes</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">does nothing a cloth mask does</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.120" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">absolutely nothing and it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">it probably is not better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">because people think they&#39;re safe are</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">wearing these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">so for reference extremely stupid</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">quite stupid now let&#39;s get into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">a respirator all right oops my</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">respirator fell apart it obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">less effective if it falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">but this thing and n95</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">masks to a lesser extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">um no not better than this and i really</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">hate that it&#39;s become it&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">political thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">this is a scientific question it can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">asked scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">this will prevent you from getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">coronavirus now</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">this will not prevent you from spreading</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">so if you&#39;ll notice the way this thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">is designed</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">the operating room is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">prevent spit not to prevent uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">microscopic virus particulates um</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">the eyes are not as big of a it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">largely through breath now</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">be aware looking at this mask um this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">is the intake and this is the exhalation</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">so when i exhale using this mask there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">actually a one-way valve in here</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">right um i will update</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">i will update if anybody can show</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">conclusive evidence</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">about the effectiveness of this or this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">i do not believe that either of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">are effective at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">and i am almost sure in fact if you look</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">at a package of cloth masks</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">um i bought a package of cloth masks i</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">wish i had the package</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">um it said very clearly on the package</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">does nothing to prevent the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">viruses</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">these things are virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">devices and honestly look</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a political thing for me i</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">don&#39;t like being forced into other</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">people&#39;s religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">here uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">there are not good studies on masks</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">because they&#39;re kind of hard to do and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">have locked</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">um and we&#39;ll look into we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">studies in a minute but here</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">oh yeah no if you really want the uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">if you really want the mask that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">effective get the this that also</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">includes the face shield</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">if you get that that covers your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">that&#39;s going to prevent the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">viral droplets i have not seen evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">that the virus is in</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">droplets either the cloth masks do</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">nothing to prevent either inhalation or</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">exhalation you can literally see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">holes this is a pair of calvin klein</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">boxers it&#39;s made the same thing as cloth</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">um so you know if there&#39;s anything to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">take away from this</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s do it let&#39;s see part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">problem and we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">before is that a lot of the studies</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">if you find a study on masks well you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the global warming problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">if global warming is not a thing you</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s one quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">scientific consensus if you publish a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">article now on uh if you publish an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.279" style="s2">article saying you know global warming</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">is not not a scam but you know not as</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.279" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">bad as people think</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get funding from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">nih right uh funding from the you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">national science foundation or who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">ever who&#39;s ever given out grants for</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">these things right</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be the same thing with the uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">the nih and coronavirus you come out</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">with a study be like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">you know masks aren&#39;t really that useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">well you&#39;re not getting funding again</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">um if i think the virus isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">droplets well</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">my understanding is the virus is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">produced in the lungs</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">my argument against the virus being in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">droplets is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">if it was in droplets and spit why is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">the test not spinning a cup</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">why do they have to take a a swab and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">stick it six inches up your nose</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">um like it&#39;s it&#39;s my point is once</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">things become politicized it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">difficult to get any sort of real</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">information on them</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">now that said there have been some good</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">studies on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">the different uh treatments</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">so if we go back to this is my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">coronavirus repo on github</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:59.000" style="s2">um i listed a few potential uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">treatments back in the day um</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.000" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">hydroxychloroquinolone plus zinc uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to we&#39;ll get to that one later</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">again unfortunately that one became</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">politicized</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard to get any real</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">um on that but i think the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">interesting one is remdesseviere</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">um so remdesavir is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">uh adenosine analog meaning that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">believe it&#39;s the adenosine and rna</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">rna uses the same adenosine as dna i</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just they don&#39;t use thiamine they</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">use uracil</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">no not everything is political in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">america everything is political on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">american news</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">the most part of america hates politics</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">um politics is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">at least historically when i grew up is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">like a bad word in america</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">once something&#39;s politicized you get you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">get bias</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">right um now this is not this is not one</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">side of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">uh everyone involved in politics in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">america does this</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">um even you know we&#39;ll rip on someone no</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">one cares about like libertarians</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">um if libertarians came out you know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">there was a study that showed that uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">fiat money actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">promotes economic growth more than uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">having a gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">don&#39;t publish that study man don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:18.360" style="s2">publish that study we got to get back on</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">gold um</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.360" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">so you&#39;re taking a mouth swab test again</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a scraping swab it&#39;s not a spit</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">test right yeah ron</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">paul 2008 man ron paul 2012 i remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">ron paul revel love lucian dexmethazone</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">yeah yeah so we&#39;re going to look into</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">dexamethasone as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">um we&#39;re going to look into so i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">basically three things come out and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">all work differently</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">so there&#39;s hydroxychloroquinolone um</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">there&#39;s uh remdessevere and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">dexamethasone</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">so let&#39;s look into studies for all three</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">and i seem biased toward presuming the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">mass perspective is foolish with what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">um so let&#39;s let&#39;s look at ramdas of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">studies</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">so things that we&#39;re looking for in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">studies that are good</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">is we want studies that are double blind</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">and we want studies that are large</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">um so double blind means that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">neither the patients nor the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">experimenters know who&#39;s in which group</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">um obviously they have the control group</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">and the experimental group</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">this basic science 101 um your control</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">group receives a placebo</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">uh your experimental group receives the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">drug and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">nobody knows until after the study is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">um who&#39;s in which group so you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">record everything you don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">experimenters to know because they might</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">biased you obviously don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">people to know because the placebo</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">effect is quite real</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">um so that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking for in</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">studies double blind large sample size</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">and reasonable thing tracked um so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">another thing to look for in studies too</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see if we can find any</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">evidence of this is pre-registration</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">uh yeah we can zoom in um</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">so pre-registration means that they said</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">what they were going to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">before they did the study</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">uh so i think the uk uk</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">covid studies i forget what it was</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">uh so first off some basics on death</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">methazone my understanding is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">steroid</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:35.160" style="s2">um corticosteroid uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">now something to note about all</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.160" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">corticosteroids</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">is that they block the immune system and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">they&#39;re also anti-inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">so if you&#39;re familiar with a drug like</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">ibuprofen</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">ibuprofen is an nsab it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">i think all steroids are both</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">anti-inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">and immunosuppressant but i&#39;m not 100</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">on that um but i know it&#39;s true about</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">dexmethozone</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">so dexmethazone is corticosteroid</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">equals anti-inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">plus immunosuppressant</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">now let&#39;s look at the study</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">background damage corticosteroids</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">modulate immune mediated lung</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">injury immune media so basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">um when they talk about the cytokine</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">storm at the end of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">uh you have that&#39;s being done largely i</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">believe by your immune system and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">is ending up doing more damage than the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">virus so if we can suppress the immune</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">people might um</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">um it is large though so that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">and the primary outcome was 28 day</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">mortality so i like that as an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">basically how many people died</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">so they weren&#39;t included in the sample</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">you have to be really careful with all</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">this stuff because these effects are</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">pretty small</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">their final outcome of the study showed</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">reduced deaths by one-third receiving</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">no this definitely doesn&#39;t reduce your</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">obviously right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">um well we can ask that question too</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference in the us and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">european countries that did much better</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">are we 100 percent sure that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">actually did better</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">here here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">um the united states is out testing</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">like all of the not everybody i think i</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">think iceland beats the united states</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">i mean let&#39;s say that let&#39;s even just</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">talk about the false positive rate of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">the test and i don&#39;t think this is true</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">i think you can control for this pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">well statistically but if a test has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">one percent false positive rate</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">and we&#39;re doing two tests for every</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">well two tests for every thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">says 300 million people in america so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">we&#39;re testing 0.2 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">so 300 times 0.2 percent um</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">0.2 percent so</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s 0.6 million so we&#39;re text we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">testing 600 thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">a day right if this test rate has a one</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">percent false positive rate</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to expect six thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">cases of coronavirus a day that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">real cases of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">um now i&#39;m not exactly sure this is true</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">what is the daily cases per day</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">i still like this tracker</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">we can ask the strain hypothesis too</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">okay the daily cases are</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">so we&#39;d expect 10 of these well we</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">should actually look up what&#39;s the false</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">positive rate of the test</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">and which test they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">i can just find something generic if the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">antibody tests have a lot of false</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">positives i know i think the rtpcr test</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have too many</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">um also an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">saying you can&#39;t find any trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.840" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">scientific note on us work on a subject</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">once it becomes politicized as a fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">no i didn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">but it says it&#39;s harder to right but</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">really hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">like i think you&#39;d be very hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">a mask study because that&#39;s a hard thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">to study right</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at a test like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">on a drug where it&#39;s it&#39;s large and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">hopefully double blind</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">um so this is the dexamethasone study</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">seems to have effects in late stage</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">which would make sense blocking</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">immune response</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">um let&#39;s find that rim death severe</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">study this is what got me interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">this again because from death severe</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">actually looks good</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">um now we have a bias here with</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">remdesseviere remember gilead</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">has a big financial incentive and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">this i found interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">how has this not gone up right</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m tempted to buy gilead uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">gilead stock because well we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">that later and i don&#39;t own any gilead</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">stock full disclosure you know i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">don&#39;t make any money off you doing yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">i think it was this study here</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">um i get a pdf version here we go</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">so okay a few cool things about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:45.720" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">double-blind randomized</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.720" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">placebo-controlled trial</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">patients were randomly assigned to</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">outcome i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">and i want to see if they pre-registered</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">this or not right because this could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">a thing where</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">you you really i like the 28-day death</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">number a whole lot better</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">maybe we can find it in the study and do</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">our own statistics on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">but a total of a thousand patients</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">underwent randomization</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">early unblinding of the results okay i</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">don&#39;t like that</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting to note about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">spikes in america</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">uh so i&#39;m actually i&#39;m in new jersey</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">really similar to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">to all of europe i think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">population of the eu</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a bit larger than america</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">let&#39;s do land area of eu</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">okay so the united states is about twice</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">as physically large</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">europe has 50 more people um so united</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">states again is it&#39;s many different</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">uh if you look at new york um there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">spike</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">if you look at new york it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">this if you look at california</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">it looks like this um by the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">what this really shows to me also and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">talked about this at the end of last</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">stream is</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">why did california do a lockdown when</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">things looked like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">it was incredibly stupid and now when</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">you might want to consider a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">there is much less uh political support</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">because you kept people locked down for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:01.039" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">in new york there was a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.039" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">starting here at the peak of a spike and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">well you know now it looks like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">i&#39;m so new jersey looks similar to new</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">york it&#39;s almost called the identical</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">where texas and florida look a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">like well california&#39;s been steady up</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">the whole time florida and texas have</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">seen spikes</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">on new jersey and new york have seen no</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">second wave and illinois has started to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">see a second wave</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not trolling about masks uh so</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">face diapers there&#39;s some evidence maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">um but there is absolutely zero evidence</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">for cloth masks</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">but cloth masks do absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re it&#39;s like wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">cross around your neck and saying i wear</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">check out this about cloth masks all</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">right again only real study please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">link me to any conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">websites</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">uh visualizing speech generated oral</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">fluid droplets so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">um this again this isn&#39;t a mask study</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">right do masks make the air go less far</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">well obviously yes right you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">do this with the sim you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">study with the simplest stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t change the total volume</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">of air</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s been uh breathed out right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">even if the air goes slightly less far</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">right like what if there&#39;s a tiny wind</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">a tiny wind cancels out the mask right</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">most air is not that stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">um this is not a mass study if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">would like to show me a controlled mask</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">i&#39;d be happy to read it and analyze it</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually have science on your</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">side i think you&#39;re using this rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">um let&#39;s also let&#39;s let&#39;s look into this</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">for a little bit is this a p95</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">respirator</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">um by the way this also doesn&#39;t apply to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">n95 masks</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">i think there&#39;s definitely at least some</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">evidence for n95 masks</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.760" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">preventing you from getting coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">i&#39;m specifically railing against face</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">diapers</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">um a p95 mask</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">yeah p95 mask</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference in a p95 and n95</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">does not protect against oily particles</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">uh yeah i don&#39;t think coronavirus is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">oily particle</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">oh well this is the other thing too</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">about how long these masks last</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">and whether people are changing them and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">disposing of them properly</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">this thing will last a long time um i</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">climbed down a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">a volcano in uh in indonesia</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">um and this is all there&#39;s all sulfur at</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">the bottom of the volcano and i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">wearing a gas mask not a good one i</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">rented it in indonesia</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">and it slipped off my face a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">i took in a breath of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">oh my god um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">a p100 what&#39;s a 100</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">oh yeah now we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">and this might this might be a p100 well</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">see if we can find any evidence</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">any words on it organic vapers</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">3m i actually bought this for allergies</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">that&#39;s very effective against allergies</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">3m part number 501 this doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">have a model number on it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">oh wait is p200 a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">no but i mean yeah the other problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">with these things is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">while it may filter the air you breathe</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">it does not filter any of the air you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">breathe out</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">um no so uh association of country-wide</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">mortality with mask wearing</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">means absolutely nothing that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">completely uncontrolled study</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">the problem is people who are more</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">compliant in masks are probably also</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">more compliant social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">social distancing pretty obviously uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not like i don&#39;t know about six</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">feet versus but let me tell you if</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">you&#39;re in a different house from</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">yes chronovirus doesn&#39;t spread between</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">houses</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">um this works great for i&#39;m allergic to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">something in new jersey or</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">something in this house and uh this</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">works great for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">and 95 is the threshold for masks</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">working i would believe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">i would believe that um okay let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">a look in uh at rim destiny</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">i mean always remember if somebody ever</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">tries to tell you that you&#39;re a bad</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">for not believing in some science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">probably because that science is</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">questionable</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">they won&#39;t resort to it if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">nobody tells you you&#39;re a bad person for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">not believing two plus two equals four</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">okay um so again we have to look for</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">by one one of the big concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">bias here</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">is remdesseviere is a it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">patented by gilead pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s success means monetary success</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.839" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna adapt a platform to rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">conduct a series of phase</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">three let&#39;s just look up fda phase three</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">what&#39;s phase three mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">phase three are random controlled</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.320" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">multi-center</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">oh well that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">uh yeah that&#39;d be nice that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">else we should look for i mean because</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">if it&#39;s double if it&#39;s truly</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">double-blind and they follow good</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">double-blind protocols</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">then this probably is less of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">but yeah i mean there could also be</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">something else so i like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">keeping your data in multiple data</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">centers</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">uh phase three trial is the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">expensive time consuming difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">especially for chronic um</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">enrollment oh there were 60 trial sites</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.839" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">so what a written policy for use on</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">other treatments</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">before enrollment in the trial</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">i see i like this</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">missed doses intermittently how this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">iv for hospitalized people how did they</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">miss doses</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">um why would i</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">well i mean i guess it kind of says</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">something but</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">this is i mean this is just interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">64 male</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">patients receiving oxygen proportion</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">recovered</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">so i mean just just just looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">off the top of my head though it does</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">get kind of small it seems like rim</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">deserver is the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">uh effective for patients receiving</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">oxygen but once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">here it doesn&#39;t do all that much which</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">is it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m going to guess right now that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">normal course of treatment is going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">look like rim desevere early on</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">and then once you&#39;re going on high flow</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">oxygen dexamethasone to knock out your</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">immune system</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">cumulative recovery estimate so why are</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">they using these estimates and why are</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">they not using just</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">true recovery</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">number of recoveries but number of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">recoveries over what</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">time horizon</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">to unblind the results to the trial team</p>

<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">that remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">politics doesn&#39;t have anything to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">with party politics it can also be</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">corporate politics</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">right it can also be gileads trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">fast-track this and sell a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">thousand doses to the state of louisiana</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">or something right</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">given the high mortality rate despite</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">the use of industries it&#39;s clear the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">treatment with an antiviral drug alone</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">is not likely to be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">it&#39;s finding support we&#39;re hospitalized</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">and require additional oxygen therapy</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">i mean this is interesting to note as</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">well like i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">also there&#39;s a treatment for the flu and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">we should look into how this one works</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">tamiflu</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">so tamiflu i think is fda approved to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">actually shorten</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">the uh the duration of the flu which</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s behaving</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">similarly to remdessevier for covet but</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">let&#39;s figure out how this one works</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">oh never mind concludes that it does not</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">reduce hospitalization there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">evidence of reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">complications okay maybe this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">um yeah and this this works it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">completely different uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.319" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">mechanism too</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">nerimidase so i don&#39;t think uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">i mean if you guys watch my other</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">streams</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there there&#39;s any remedies</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">in coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">um we did a whole lot of reading</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">remember here&#39;s oh here&#39;s all the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">proteins that are in coronavirus from</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">the last streams</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">and like you know it pretty well now</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">there&#39;s uh i don&#39;t think chronovirus has</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">this one of the biggest things that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">has one of the things that it spends</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">most of its um room coding for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">is rna-dependent rna polymerase which i</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">think is relatively a large part of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">dna</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">i mean look at the size of that protein</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">huh from there no chronovirus isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">there they give all these viruses stupid</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">multi-letter names</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">so i i so also remdesavir back in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">day i remember it showed the highest</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">uh highest binding affinity</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">uh they did these these computer</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">simulations they just remember something</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">about investigating 13.</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">all right since we got some new people</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">so i&#39;m not so sure the droplets thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">means means anything at all um</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">this virus replicates in your lungs</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">ah what is this about shingles</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">treatment for shingles</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">uh well so these are so these these</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">these other</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">uh cyclovirs i mean these are aids drugs</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">and herpes drugs too</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">um how do these ones work i probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">looked this up last time</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">inhibits and inactivates dna polymerases</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">it prevents replication so so this um</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">remdessever uh prevents</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">so when it&#39;s replicating i think it uses</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">these fake adenosines in the rna</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not a hundred percent sure on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">we can look into this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">in nuclear ribonucleotide analogs</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">okay i&#39;m guessing there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2">oh azt this is another this is another</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">common aids drug</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">affimidine all right so this is the t so</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">rna doesn&#39;t have t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">right rna uses uracil instead of thymine</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">i can&#39;t spell sorry</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">huh most of the words feminine</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">production</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">you can take</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">oh they use thiamidine to produce this</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">oh yeah look they just replaced the uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">bboh group with uh what&#39;s an oh group is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">this an alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">oh group is an alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry my internet glitched for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">hydroxyl it&#39;s a hydroxyl group saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">my god see i should know this um</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">i mean ethanol has a hydroxyl group so</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">what&#39;s the alcohol group</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">like that that&#39;s a hydroxyl group and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">ethanol linked to a hydroxyl</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">that carries at least one hydroxyl</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">functional group bound to a saturated</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">carbon atom so what does saturated mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">this would be saturated right because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">has a hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">and so you have saturated yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">saturated saturated fats of single</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.520" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">carbon bonds the unsaturated have double</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">carbon bonds</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">um okay let&#39;s look into</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.400" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine now</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">when i looked at hydroxychloroquine last</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">time um</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">what i found is that we would not expect</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">to yes saturates no double bonds uh we</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about politics in here please</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">cut all the politics talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">um you could talk about politics on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">meta level talking about politics on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">object level</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">is not welcome um</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">so yeah let&#39;s look into hydroxychloric</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">now we would not</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">expect it to be effective on its own</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">because what we looked into last time is</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">chloroquine is a zinc ionopore</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">the hydroxychloroquine just lets the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">zinc into the cell</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">which lowers the uh which which makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">this stuff not work as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">so if the virus can&#39;t replicate you do</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">not get more</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">virus um so i think that no i like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">uk</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">study now less because it is an open</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">trial was that their term for it they</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">had a term i should i should know these</p>

<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">um recovery trial here we go</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.079" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">recoverychild.net that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">uh let&#39;s oh yeah she&#39;s looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">terminals open label</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">open label um</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.359" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s look at their</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.520" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine study</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">no benefit</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">did they also receive zinc or did they</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">just receive</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine and why is there not</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">a paper for this one</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">dexmethazones on there oh yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">ratanavir they found no benefit for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">let&#39;s look at how this one works</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">this is like an aids cocktail right</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">protease inhibitor</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a protease</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">oh the cleaving oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">i remember that how&#39;s this one work</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">booster inhibits hiv protease</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not sure why people would</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">expect this to work for growtovirus</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">we could really i&#39;m thinking like we</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.319" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">should dive back into it to see if like</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">now with this new information like does</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">coronavirus have a protease</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">um does it have that other uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">but yeah i&#39;m not surprised that that one</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have well we just did</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">have some proteases right</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">springs back up replicase</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">poly protein</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">poppy and like protease</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">so this is what&#39;s doing the the cleaving</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">damn you know i gotta you always gotta</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">comment your code better i wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">code a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">but yeah so this is the the replication</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.839" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">this thing has a bunch of proteins</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">or f1 and f1b formula replication</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">there&#39;s the exploit vector which is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">spike um</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what that does</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">the envelope and the membrane</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">and then the capsid</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the air oh yeah we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">the hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">why don&#39;t we have a paper for this one</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">policy political trash</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.599" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">retracted a paper that said it increased</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:13.780" style="s2">death risk i&#39;m great they put the word</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">why did they retract it</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.780" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">you have to use zinc as well so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">the study i want to find you guys find</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">any studies</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">yeah we checked out room designer and</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:24.559" style="s2">death severe is the first one we checked</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">uh well no we first checked out</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.079" style="s2">dexamethasone</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">but i&#39;m bullish on rim december i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.079" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">it definitely has a real effect</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:42.559" style="s2">um i don&#39;t want any political stuff if</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">you guys can show me a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.559" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">a actual i&#39;m looking for what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.960" style="s2">looking for is a large</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">double-blind randomized study on</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.960" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">plus zinc</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a marcos i&#39;m looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">now so here this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">yeah okay so this is showing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">without zinc it doesn&#39;t work which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">there was a uh yeah a chloroquine and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">zinc ionopore</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">so alone neither hydroxychloroquine or</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">zinc work</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">but what hydroxychloroquine allows zinc</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:46.960" style="s2">into the cell and then once it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">cell it blocks</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.960" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">rna-dependent rna polymerase um</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">so let&#39;s see when did this come out may</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">take a look at this well first</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">this is not a study at all this is just</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">looking at data</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">ah there could be so many other</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">confounding factors there</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t like this can we find a good</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.520" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">all right we got clinical trials here</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">a study of hydroxychloroquine and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">prevention of covid</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">multicenter oh oh compared to okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">okay this is good</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">did this study come out yet estimated</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">study completion date july 31st so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">not out yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">we have information</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:05.680" style="s2">this website&#39;s cool clinicaltrials.gov</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">show me all the clinical trials i wish</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">they had like a trending clinical trials</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">i could see what like cool new drugs</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.799" end="01:00:12.839" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">listed clinical studies related to</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.839" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:21.000" style="s2">oh you can you can sign up for them</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">oh that&#39;s pretty cool i can get</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.000" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">infloxable if i go up to tufts</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">what&#39;s in fleximab</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">chimeric monoclonal okay i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">know that much about monoclonal</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:35.520" style="s2">antibodies we are going to spend a</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">little time looking into the viability</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.520" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">of a vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">um my initial just like common sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">take on that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">is people looked for a long time for a</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">vaccine for car</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">sars the vaccine for the flu is very hit</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">or miss</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">um so i am bearish on a vaccine i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">bullish</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">on remdesseviere and things that look</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">um you know usually this is a my</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">understanding is this is a relatively</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">new uh drug class</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:07.200" style="s2">um antivirals have have helped against</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">all sorts of antivirals of this you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">everyone knows about antibiotics</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">but there are antivirals that work um</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to hear you know you people</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">argue about sweden and like oh sweden</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">did this oh it looks like this it looks</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.280" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">is it 10x if it&#39;s not 10x i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">to hear 40 percent</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">you know what does that mean that your</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">40</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">can get you can come from so many</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">different factors</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">there was another study talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">different blood types and whether you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">die or not and i&#39;m like yeah but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:40.559" style="s2">understand blood type is like there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">other inputs into what your blood type</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">is blood types are not randomly</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">distributed through the population</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:53.440" style="s2">um i you know the the the amount of of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">pseudoscience and stupidity</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.440" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">uh that that that goes around and then</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s best to have security and know you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">have security it&#39;s second best to not</p>

<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same way with knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.880" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s best to have knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">know you have knowledge it&#39;s second best</p>

<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a mass study it came out in</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">2008 before there was any uh political</p>

<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">um the problem is it&#39;s very obvious</p>

<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">figure out how to make some masks</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:22.720" style="s2">effective and some masks ineffective</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:24.400" style="s2">distribute them randomly</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.720" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">see who gets the disease and who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.400" end="01:05:28.319" style="s2">right that would be that would be a real</p>

<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:17.760" style="s2">and know you don&#39;t have security</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:19.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s the worst to not have security</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.760" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">but know you have security</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.360" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">right and this is what things like cloth</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">masks do which don&#39;t block</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">anything but they give people a false</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:29.040" style="s2">sense of security and you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">i i just i really hate things that look</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.040" end="01:12:33.679" style="s2">like that um these face diapers</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit more evidence for</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.679" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">them but</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">again yeah sure if you wore a new one</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">you changed it every 30 minutes and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">used it perfectly maybe you&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:45.920" style="s2">something um but i think overall again</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">like stop giving people a false sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">security with this crap if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">be serious</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:51.760" style="s2">about wearing a mask to prevent</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">coronavirus and again this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:55.920" style="s2">prevent your spread of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:57.360" style="s2">this prevents you from getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.920" end="01:12:59.920" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.360" end="01:13:01.600" style="s2">um it has a different intake and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.920" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">exhalation route</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.600" end="01:13:04.960" style="s2">but if you walk around wearing one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:06.239" style="s2">these all day you&#39;re not only not going</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.960" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">to get coronavirus you&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.239" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">going to get a whole lot of other crap</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">in the air um i was thinking about like</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:11.679" style="s2">a cool technology thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:13.120" style="s2">would be it&#39;s kind of hard to breathe</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.679" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">with one of these on so you can put it</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.120" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">on you guys can barely even hear me</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.840" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t want any reminders i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.760" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">any virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.080" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">yeah what i&#39;d like to see is a mask that</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:34.800" style="s2">has uh it&#39;s battery powered</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:36.080" style="s2">and it makes it easier for me to breathe</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">right like they could constantly</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.080" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">circulate the air through these filters</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">um there&#39;s also ones that have the eye</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:44.840" style="s2">thing if you really want to be if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">really want to be protected against some</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.840" end="01:13:48.080" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">um you&#39;re not gonna get air yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.080" end="01:13:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying like if you put</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">like a battery powered little uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.120" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">little like like fan on this thing i</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">think it would be awesome</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:07.840" style="s2">my iq is over nine thousand bro</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:11.360" style="s2">over nine thousand got nine thousand iqs</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.840" end="01:14:13.080" style="s2">ah so yeah what we were looking at we</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.360" end="01:14:15.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten to the truth of uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.080" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine um so</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.560" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine alone</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t expect to do anything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.040" end="01:14:22.880" style="s2">looking for large</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">randomized studies on hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.880" end="01:14:26.000" style="s2">plus zinc</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">things have been all over the place and</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.000" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">i think one of the explanations for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">is some of them are using zinc and some</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">of them aren&#39;t using zinc</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.040" end="01:14:40.000" style="s2">disturb the flow of air</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:41.199" style="s2">why do you think that matters right</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.000" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the other thing about social</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.199" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">distancing too</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all great if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">actually staying six feet apart but</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:48.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re like in a line right</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">you breathe out particles are suspended</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">in the air</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">next person walks takes up your air</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:53.840" style="s2">breathes in the particles gets the virus</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:55.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.840" end="01:14:57.199" style="s2">so oh no it stopped the air from going</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.840" end="01:14:58.560" style="s2">further away from you great it created</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.199" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">an even bigger cloud that the next</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.560" end="01:15:01.040" style="s2">person&#39;s going to walk into like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.040" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re not blocking the particles you</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:06.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">right where are the particles ending up</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.640" end="01:15:09.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">viruses</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.120" end="01:15:11.920" style="s2">right there&#39;s always a question of where</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:13.840" style="s2">the particles are ending up if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.920" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">answer that question very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.840" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">your mask does nothing um so to answer</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:19.120" style="s2">the question for this thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:22.000" style="s2">the particles end up inside these</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.120" end="01:15:23.840" style="s2">filters which you can then replace</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.000" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">um you know i can i can pull this thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.840" end="01:15:27.679" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:28.719" style="s2">uh it&#39;s like too sure how to pull it</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.719" end="01:15:35.199" style="s2">um but yeah so this for example</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">would be chock full of coronavirus uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.199" end="01:15:39.120" style="s2">i&#39;m showing it to the microphone not to</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:43.440" style="s2">the camera</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.120" end="01:15:43.440" style="s2">over 9000 is a joke from dragon ball z</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">um oh how about the psychological effect</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:49.760" style="s2">i hate these things yeah what about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:50.560" style="s2">psychological effect between behind</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">crosses</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:53.600" style="s2">to remind everybody that god is up there</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:56.080" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.600" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">right it turns out that people wearing</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.080" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">crosses commit 30 percent less murders</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:02.800" style="s2">so we&#39;ve made it mandatory for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">to wear crosses so they have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.800" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">psychological reminder that god is</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.640" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">watching them</p>

<p begin="01:22:15.199" end="01:22:18.239" style="s2">so wait so there&#39;s the good study</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.560" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s the study from recovery trial</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.239" end="01:22:22.840" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">um without zinc uh seems</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.840" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">ineffective</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.040" end="01:22:40.000" style="s2">i mean this is a press release do they</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:40.000" style="s2">have the actual</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.840" end="01:22:53.840" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.040" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">uh and we&#39;ll add in just because they</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.080" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">did it and these studies seem super high</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.840" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.040" end="01:23:37.360" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.320" end="01:23:37.360" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:42.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think kobit has</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.440" end="01:23:49.840" style="s2">a protease</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.760" end="01:23:57.040" style="s2">drugs are protease inhibitors</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.280" end="01:24:04.159" style="s2">um so my understanding from the research</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.400" end="01:24:05.040" style="s2">i did before on hydroxychloroquine and</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.159" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">zinc</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.040" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">is zinc blocks rna-dependent rna</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:12.560" style="s2">polymerase so in the presence of zinc</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:14.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t get replication of the virus</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.560" end="01:24:15.199" style="s2">the problem is the virus is replicating</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.239" end="01:24:17.400" style="s2">in cells</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.199" end="01:24:19.520" style="s2">which zinc can&#39;t get to but</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.400" end="01:24:21.199" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.520" end="01:24:24.080" style="s2">zinc ionopore</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.199" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">uh i think i used this as a citation for</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.080" end="01:24:27.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.719" end="01:24:28.719" style="s2">i&#39;m meaning it allows zinc into the cell</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.199" end="01:24:30.280" style="s2">so before</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.719" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">evidence doesn&#39;t look great for</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.280" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine but it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.239" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">like these studies uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">gave supplemental zinc now supplemental</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:38.800" style="s2">zinc may have no effect there may be</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:40.880" style="s2">enough zinc just</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.800" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">in the human body that this effect just</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.880" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t strong but yeah what i really want</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:45.760" style="s2">to see is studies is</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:47.520" style="s2">large-scale randomized control studies</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.760" end="01:24:51.040" style="s2">like recovery trial</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:51.040" style="s2">where they um</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.600" end="01:24:56.840" style="s2">they also include zinc i don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.239" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">azithromycin has anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.840" end="01:25:00.159" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:02.000" style="s2">uh unless people think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.159" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">secondary bacterial infection causing</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.000" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">problems but i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">evidence for that</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.940" end="01:25:55.520" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.880" end="01:25:56.639" style="s2">um zinc generally stimulates areas of</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.520" end="01:25:59.600" style="s2">the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.639" end="01:26:01.280" style="s2">i haven&#39;t seen evidence for this either</p>

<p begin="01:26:01.280" end="01:26:06.880" style="s2">i still i still really like the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.560" end="01:26:06.880" style="s2">hypothesis that zinc blocks</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.440" end="01:26:13.440" style="s2">ah here this one i think was on happy i</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.239" end="01:26:13.440" style="s2">have a bunch of citations there</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.840" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:28.800" style="s2">i wish i could find the studies on this</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:30.639" style="s2">too because i i want to see maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.800" end="01:26:31.600" style="s2">just gave zinc and didn&#39;t really discuss</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.639" end="01:26:33.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.600" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">so this could actually be the study that</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.280" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:45.520" style="s2">full details of the study protocol and</p>

<p begin="01:27:36.320" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">what so they removed it in june i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.400" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">previous versions of the study protocol</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:27:53.199" style="s2">why did they remove it i don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.199" end="01:28:00.080" style="s2">um okay so they did not</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.199" end="01:28:03.199" style="s2">they did not give zinc uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.080" end="01:28:05.679" style="s2">in the study all right we got we got</p>

<p begin="01:29:06.480" end="01:29:10.560" style="s2">uh long qt lots of weird stuff i would</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.840" end="01:29:13.760" style="s2">take</p>

<p begin="01:29:13.760" end="01:29:16.800" style="s2">supplemental oxygen and then if they</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.360" end="01:29:21.040" style="s2">were going to put me on a ventilator</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.800" end="01:29:24.480" style="s2">i&#39;d take dexamethasone um</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.040" end="01:29:26.480" style="s2">is this virus mutating like the flu</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.480" end="01:29:28.239" style="s2">uh what was that slight star codex link</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.480" end="01:29:29.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t have it anymore</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.840" end="01:35:18.560" style="s2">theories but like conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.840" end="01:35:21.920" style="s2">is mad dumb and they&#39;re banned there is</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.560" end="01:35:21.920" style="s2">no hope with corona</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.480" end="01:35:27.520" style="s2">uh not trying to do armchair science i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.400" end="01:35:28.000" style="s2">not trying to i&#39;m not saying i&#39;m doing</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.000" end="01:35:31.840" style="s2">now we&#39;re just doing information</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.360" end="01:35:31.840" style="s2">gathering</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.560" end="01:35:36.000" style="s2">why am i looking for zinc um because</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.360" end="01:35:38.239" style="s2">zinc</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.000" end="01:35:40.080" style="s2">so the belief is that hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.239" end="01:35:41.840" style="s2">itself does nothing against coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.080" end="01:35:43.119" style="s2">this is my like working hypothesis on</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.840" end="01:35:44.480" style="s2">this and it may be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.119" end="01:35:45.600" style="s2">but what i&#39;d like to see is a big</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.480" end="01:35:47.199" style="s2">randomly controlled study on</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.600" end="01:35:48.320" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine plus zinc</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.199" end="01:35:49.920" style="s2">these are things that are known to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.320" end="01:35:51.040" style="s2">safe in the human population i see no</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.920" end="01:35:52.639" style="s2">reason why they would</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.040" end="01:35:54.480" style="s2">interact because again you know all</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.639" end="01:35:56.719" style="s2">these things guys i&#39;m not a doctor</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.480" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">the only thing i can tell you is that i</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.719" end="01:36:01.119" style="s2">do promise you</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.840" end="01:36:02.800" style="s2">without a doubt that this mask is way</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.119" end="01:36:04.239" style="s2">more effective than a face diaper that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.800" end="01:36:05.840" style="s2">the only thing i&#39;ll say without a doubt</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.239" end="01:36:08.520" style="s2">and if that turns out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.840" end="01:36:11.840" style="s2">you know then i&#39;m wrong about everything</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.520" end="01:36:11.840" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.400" end="01:36:15.760" style="s2">slave star codex clarified his mass</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.320" end="01:36:24.960" style="s2">position on part three</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.760" end="01:36:27.280" style="s2">of the post let&#39;s see what we have</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.960" end="01:36:27.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.320" end="01:36:35.440" style="s2">i must have read this because this i</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.760" end="01:36:35.440" style="s2">showed off that parachute study it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.840" end="01:36:39.840" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.400" end="01:36:59.840" style="s2">yeah again i i agree with what he says</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.280" end="01:37:01.679" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.840" end="01:37:05.280" style="s2">i agree with the rationality i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.679" end="01:37:09.600" style="s2">necessarily agree with the conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.280" end="01:37:10.639" style="s2">um i think that the odds of them being</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.600" end="01:37:12.719" style="s2">effective is</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.639" end="01:37:14.560" style="s2">at least cloth masks masks that have</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.719" end="01:37:16.639" style="s2">visible holes in them</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.560" end="01:37:18.080" style="s2">is way lower than 80 and i think there</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.639" end="01:37:20.480" style="s2">is a cost</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.080" end="01:37:22.320" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s a costs coming from</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.480" end="01:37:24.719" style="s2">one scientific and one non-scientific</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.320" end="01:37:27.119" style="s2">factor and the scientific factor is</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.719" end="01:37:29.199" style="s2">um i think you show that like people</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.119" end="01:37:31.440" style="s2">wearing helmets on bikes hit their head</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.199" end="01:37:33.840" style="s2">way more than people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.440" end="01:37:35.600" style="s2">uh or what what is the there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.840" end="01:37:36.239" style="s2">classic one where the effect is really</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.600" end="01:37:37.679" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.239" end="01:37:39.280" style="s2">where people think they are wearing a</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.679" end="01:37:40.880" style="s2">form of protection and then they take</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.280" end="01:37:41.679" style="s2">more risks that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.880" end="01:37:44.080" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.679" end="01:37:46.239" style="s2">um if for example people who got</p>

<p begin="01:39:02.239" end="01:39:05.199" style="s2">that&#39;s um i had a conversation with a</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.480" end="01:39:08.400" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.199" end="01:39:09.280" style="s2">and he said look uh even if masks aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.400" end="01:39:11.199" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.280" end="01:39:13.280" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s some chance that</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.199" end="01:39:14.480" style="s2">they are we should say that the science</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.280" end="01:39:16.960" style="s2">supports them</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.480" end="01:39:18.719" style="s2">and sure in the short term maybe this is</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.960" end="01:39:20.320" style="s2">a win but in the long term what it does</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.719" end="01:39:22.000" style="s2">is it erodes trust and science in</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.320" end="01:39:23.360" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.000" end="01:39:25.360" style="s2">uh and you don&#39;t want to do that like</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.360" end="01:39:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not worth it</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.360" end="01:39:30.400" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s clearly printed on the</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.400" end="01:39:30.880" style="s2">outside of every pack of cloth masks you</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.400" end="01:39:34.639" style="s2">buy</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.880" end="01:39:34.639" style="s2">this mask does nothing to prevent</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.840" end="01:39:41.840" style="s2">viruses</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.080" end="01:39:45.119" style="s2">yeah why are they trying hydroxyl</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.679" end="01:39:46.639" style="s2">chlorine without zinc to be honest i</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.119" end="01:39:49.520" style="s2">have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.639" end="01:39:51.280" style="s2">um no i don&#39;t know why doctor disrespect</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.520" end="01:39:52.800" style="s2">got banned but i&#39;m as curious as you</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.280" end="01:39:54.960" style="s2">guys</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.800" end="01:39:56.080" style="s2">um whatever it is twitch if i did it</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.960" end="01:39:57.679" style="s2">please just tell me</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.080" end="01:39:59.760" style="s2">please tell me i don&#39;t want to be i</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.679" end="01:40:03.360" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be disrespected</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.760" end="01:40:03.360" style="s2">disrespected um</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.040" end="01:40:08.400" style="s2">all right we have a journal link here</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.400" end="01:40:10.320" style="s2">what do we got</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.400" end="01:40:12.080" style="s2">uh are there any alternatives i mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.320" end="01:40:13.760" style="s2">stricter lockdowns will stricter</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.080" end="01:40:15.440" style="s2">lockdowns will definitely bring down the</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.760" end="01:40:17.280" style="s2">spread of a virus so my conclusion at</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.440" end="01:40:19.600" style="s2">the end of all of this</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.280" end="01:40:21.280" style="s2">was all the lockdowns are going to do is</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.600" end="01:40:22.480" style="s2">shift when the virus spreads</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.280" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">i think the only way through this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.480" end="01:40:27.040" style="s2">herd immunity i also think that herd</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:27.679" style="s2">immunity is closer than a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.040" end="01:40:29.199" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.679" end="01:40:31.199" style="s2">because okay so they say to get hurt</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.199" end="01:40:32.719" style="s2">immunity you need to have a sixty</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.199" end="01:40:34.400" style="s2">percent of people or seventy percent of</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.719" end="01:40:36.560" style="s2">people have had to have the virus</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.400" end="01:40:37.920" style="s2">depending on the are not but this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.560" end="01:40:39.760" style="s2">exactly true</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.920" end="01:40:42.560" style="s2">all you need is 60 or 70 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.760" end="01:40:44.000" style="s2">people to not be able to get the virus</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.560" end="01:40:46.000" style="s2">if it turns out that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.000" end="01:40:47.920" style="s2">pre-existing immunity in 50</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.000" end="01:40:49.440" style="s2">of the population then only 10 or 20</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.920" end="01:40:50.159" style="s2">percent of the population needs to get</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.440" end="01:40:53.360" style="s2">the virus</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.159" end="01:40:54.800" style="s2">right um our culture is very bad at</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.360" end="01:40:55.760" style="s2">talking about acceptable death and</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.800" end="01:40:58.000" style="s2">unacceptable death</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.760" end="01:41:00.880" style="s2">so right now i think there&#39;s like 135</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.000" end="01:41:02.960" style="s2">000 deaths from coronavirus in america</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.880" end="01:41:04.560" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking that order of magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.960" end="01:41:06.159" style="s2">particularly when most of the population</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.560" end="01:41:08.560" style="s2">who gets it is very old</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.159" end="01:41:10.000" style="s2">this all this stuff was insane um if</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.560" end="01:41:11.199" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about potentially three</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.000" end="01:41:13.199" style="s2">million deaths one percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.199" end="01:41:14.639" style="s2">population then maybe it&#39;s not insane</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.199" end="01:41:16.239" style="s2">and if you&#39;re talking about 30 million</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.639" end="01:41:17.360" style="s2">deaths i think everybody in america</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.239" end="01:41:20.480" style="s2">would support martial law in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.360" end="01:41:23.600" style="s2">military marching in the street</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.480" end="01:41:25.679" style="s2">where does the 50 immunity come from so</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.600" end="01:41:27.360" style="s2">my theory about this and if someone like</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.679" end="01:41:29.520" style="s2">if there&#39;s some reason this is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.360" end="01:41:31.520" style="s2">uh i do back so the data that i have is</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.520" end="01:41:33.040" style="s2">that everywhere coronavirus has like</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.520" end="01:41:34.560" style="s2">ripped through the population</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.040" end="01:41:36.719" style="s2">right you can look at cruise ships you</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.560" end="01:41:38.719" style="s2">can look at like some factories</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.719" end="01:41:42.000" style="s2">i think the navy had a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.719" end="01:41:44.000" style="s2">you see about 35 to 50 percent of people</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.000" end="01:41:46.239" style="s2">become infected with the virus</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.000" end="01:41:47.199" style="s2">now why did the other 50 not become</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.239" end="01:41:48.639" style="s2">infected</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.199" end="01:41:50.400" style="s2">i think the theory that it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.639" end="01:41:53.440" style="s2">they weren&#39;t exposed seems</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.400" end="01:41:54.159" style="s2">rather low um i think it has more to do</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.440" end="01:41:56.320" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.159" end="01:42:00.000" style="s2">well they have a pre-existing immunity</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.320" end="01:42:01.840" style="s2">or some kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.000" end="01:42:03.920" style="s2">not talking about doc disrespecting here</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.840" end="01:42:06.480" style="s2">though that&#39;s that&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.920" end="01:42:06.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.520" end="01:42:13.199" style="s2">no i&#39;m not i mean so here&#39;s here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.080" end="01:42:15.760" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.199" end="01:42:17.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not i have my other my other piece</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.760" end="01:42:18.560" style="s2">of evidence for this this this hurt</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.600" end="01:42:21.040" style="s2">immunity is like</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.560" end="01:42:22.080" style="s2">does new york city have heard immunity</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.040" end="01:42:26.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.080" end="01:42:29.280" style="s2">um so the lockdowns the lockdowns are</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.159" end="01:42:31.360" style="s2">are i&#39;m in new york right now</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.280" end="01:42:32.719" style="s2">i was just in california and i would say</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.360" end="01:42:34.480" style="s2">that the lockdowns in new york and</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.719" end="01:42:35.360" style="s2">california right now are at a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.480" end="01:42:36.800" style="s2">similar level</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.360" end="01:42:38.719" style="s2">you can eat outside you have to wear</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.800" end="01:42:40.560" style="s2">masks in both places you can take masks</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.719" end="01:42:42.239" style="s2">off when you&#39;re seated</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.560" end="01:42:44.639" style="s2">number of people in the street seems</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.239" end="01:42:45.360" style="s2">very similar yet new york looks like</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.639" end="01:42:48.800" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.360" end="01:42:51.920" style="s2">and california looks like this um</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.800" end="01:42:55.119" style="s2">so one potential explanation for that is</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.920" end="01:42:56.159" style="s2">around here new york got pretty close to</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.119" end="01:42:58.000" style="s2">herd immunity</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.159" end="01:42:59.760" style="s2">it spread through most of the population</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.000" end="01:43:01.040" style="s2">that could get coronavirus and now</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.760" end="01:43:02.960" style="s2">you&#39;re just getting the tail end down</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.040" end="01:43:04.880" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.960" end="01:43:06.400" style="s2">um let&#39;s see the study let&#39;s see the</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.880" end="01:43:08.320" style="s2">study about about uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.400" end="01:43:11.840" style="s2">how long does immunity last that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.320" end="01:43:11.840" style="s2">interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.040" end="01:43:17.600" style="s2">um yeah it may require zinc additives no</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.239" end="01:43:19.199" style="s2"> like when did this come out they</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.600" end="01:43:20.480" style="s2">should have just watched my stream</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.199" end="01:43:25.840" style="s2">if they&#39;d watched my stream they would</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.480" end="01:43:25.840" style="s2">have known this</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.679" end="01:43:32.159" style="s2">yeah chloroquine can induce the uptake</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.719" end="01:43:33.280" style="s2">of zinc in the side of the cell which is</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.159" end="01:43:37.360" style="s2">capable of inhibiting</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.280" end="01:43:38.000" style="s2">rna are a rna dependent rna polymerase</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.360" end="01:43:40.000" style="s2">this is what i</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.000" end="01:43:41.679" style="s2">said on my last stream if only they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.000" end="01:43:53.840" style="s2">watched it they could have not done all</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.679" end="01:43:53.840" style="s2">these stupid studies</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.880" end="01:43:58.639" style="s2">uh here&#39;s an interesting finished study</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.600" end="01:44:01.440" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.639" end="01:44:02.880" style="s2">face masks have no uh impact is this a</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.440" end="01:44:04.239" style="s2">real study or is this a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.880" end="01:44:05.920" style="s2">theory website</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.239" end="01:44:07.679" style="s2">because unfortunately i&#39;ve seen so many</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.920" end="01:44:09.600" style="s2">conspiracy theories both ways this is a</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.679" end="01:44:13.280" style="s2">news website this is not well</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.600" end="01:44:13.280" style="s2">let&#39;s see if it links to a real study</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.920" end="01:44:22.000" style="s2">um the full report is available on the</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.719" end="01:44:24.400" style="s2">ministry website in finnish well</p>

<p begin="01:45:08.000" end="01:45:11.600" style="s2">i think i think iceland did the best um</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.920" end="01:45:13.440" style="s2">they had this beautiful tracker website</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.600" end="01:45:14.840" style="s2">from like day one and now you can go to</p>

<p begin="01:49:20.800" end="01:49:25.440" style="s2">so my understanding of the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.719" end="01:49:28.560" style="s2">is that there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.440" end="01:49:30.400" style="s2">uh there&#39;s igg and igm</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.560" end="01:49:33.760" style="s2">and one of these is short term and one</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.400" end="01:49:33.760" style="s2">of them lasts a long time</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.639" end="01:49:47.119" style="s2">uh okay the igg igm and iga</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.239" end="01:49:47.119" style="s2">what&#39;s iga</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.840" end="01:50:01.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.119" end="01:50:03.280" style="s2">igg takes time to form igm happens fast</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.520" end="01:50:04.400" style="s2">i think the igm tests are the are they</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.280" end="01:50:11.840" style="s2">like fingerprint blood tests for</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.400" end="01:50:11.840" style="s2">coronavirus they can do</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.119" end="01:50:18.560" style="s2">major types of antibody found in the</p>

<p begin="01:50:34.880" end="01:50:39.840" style="s2">too bad for antibody</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.760" end="01:50:52.800" style="s2">methods i just</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.000" end="01:50:55.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.800" end="01:50:58.919" style="s2">okay this is decent uh</p>

<p begin="01:53:53.040" end="01:53:58.560" style="s2">you just read the study and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.440" end="01:53:58.560" style="s2">this isn&#39;t science</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.199" end="01:54:04.800" style="s2">um i heard south korea had good software</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.159" end="01:54:09.199" style="s2">again high trust society</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.800" end="01:54:12.480" style="s2">oh no no internets come back</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.199" end="01:54:13.119" style="s2">all right all right all right coming</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.480" end="01:54:18.320" style="s2">back</p>

<p begin="01:54:28.000" end="01:54:31.760" style="s2">seems okay um wouldn&#39;t masks be better</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.880" end="01:54:34.080" style="s2">than nothing so</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.760" end="01:54:36.159" style="s2">don&#39;t buy into this because you can make</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.080" end="01:54:38.000" style="s2">the same argument for be</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.159" end="01:54:39.440" style="s2">be aware of any argument that you can</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.000" end="01:54:39.920" style="s2">make for wearing a cross around your</p>

<p begin="01:54:39.920" end="01:54:45.360" style="s2">right can you make the same argument</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.840" end="01:54:46.880" style="s2">well a cross isn&#39;t going to kill people</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.360" end="01:54:48.480" style="s2">north korea has better internet than</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.880" end="01:54:51.760" style="s2">this yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.480" end="01:54:55.760" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know why it&#39;s bad all right</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.760" end="01:54:57.840" style="s2">um antibody so this doesn&#39;t look super</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.760" end="01:55:00.480" style="s2">strong to me</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.840" end="01:55:00.880" style="s2">in saying that there&#39;s just studies that</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.480" end="01:55:04.239" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.880" end="01:55:06.719" style="s2">reinfection reinfection</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.239" end="01:55:06.719" style="s2">covered</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.400" end="01:55:14.400" style="s2">um i worry about national</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.920" end="01:55:14.400" style="s2">review</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.679" end="01:55:19.840" style="s2">this is at least a clinic</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.159" end="01:55:24.480" style="s2">protective immunity is short lasting</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.280" end="01:55:29.920" style="s2">again i&#39;m less interested in studies</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.840" end="01:55:31.280" style="s2">that show the decline of antibodies and</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.920" end="01:55:33.280" style="s2">how they&#39;re measured because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.280" end="01:55:34.320" style="s2">know what rate of antibodies is required</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.280" end="01:55:38.400" style="s2">for immunity</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.320" end="01:55:38.400" style="s2">what i&#39;m interested in is showing</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.800" end="01:55:47.840" style="s2">four seasonal human coronaviruses we</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.880" end="01:55:47.840" style="s2">monitor healthy subjects</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.239" end="01:55:51.280" style="s2">ah this is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.599" end="01:55:55.040" style="s2">i wonder how they got this data</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.080" end="01:56:01.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of concern also about bias</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.239" end="01:56:03.119" style="s2">and how this was collected</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.920" end="01:56:04.639" style="s2">because have you ever i mean i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.119" end="01:56:06.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve had plenty of coronaviruses in my</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.639" end="01:56:10.000" style="s2">life i don&#39;t know how i&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.800" end="01:56:10.000" style="s2">been tested for it</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.480" end="01:56:15.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve never been tested for cold i mean</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.119" end="01:56:28.080" style="s2">these type of sample collections are</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.480" end="01:56:29.599" style="s2">difficult to obtain see this but this is</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.080" end="01:56:32.800" style="s2">what i&#39;m interested in so this seems</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.599" end="01:56:32.800" style="s2">like at least a good way to</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.040" end="01:56:36.880" style="s2">only increase after successful infection</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.119" end="01:56:39.199" style="s2">also rise</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.880" end="01:56:41.280" style="s2">with asymptomatic infection and do not</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.199" end="01:56:43.840" style="s2">increase after unsuccessful viral</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.280" end="01:56:43.840" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.639" end="01:56:52.000" style="s2">yeah serology-based reinfection dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.960" end="01:56:57.840" style="s2">this is this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.000" end="01:56:57.840" style="s2">this is good this is how i do this</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.080" end="01:57:05.520" style="s2">they have like measles here as a control</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.000" end="01:57:11.840" style="s2">measles is one that once you get it once</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.520" end="01:57:11.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t get it again right</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.840" end="01:57:20.800" style="s2">full change od absorbance relative to</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.040" end="01:57:20.800" style="s2">previous visit i don&#39;t really follow</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.840" end="01:57:25.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.880" end="01:57:30.480" style="s2">oh this is cute though they they can</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.719" end="01:57:32.719" style="s2">detect reinfection by seeing a</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.480" end="01:57:34.880" style="s2">re-expression of the antibodies but</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.719" end="01:57:37.440" style="s2">no i mean that&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.880" end="01:57:37.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.679" end="01:57:42.719" style="s2">all right it looks like things have been</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.400" end="01:57:46.960" style="s2">junk</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.719" end="01:57:53.360" style="s2">uh masks for all dot co</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.960" end="01:57:57.040" style="s2">yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.360" end="01:58:07.840" style="s2">this isn&#39;t science this is politics</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.040" end="01:58:07.840" style="s2">take action to save lives</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.119" end="01:58:12.800" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m interested in taking action to</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.880" end="01:58:16.400" style="s2">save lives but i&#39;m interested in what</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.800" end="01:58:17.280" style="s2">action if you&#39;re using propaganda to</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.400" end="01:58:19.280" style="s2">market to me</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.280" end="01:58:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s probably because the truth isn&#39;t on</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.280" end="01:58:21.840" style="s2">your side</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.199" end="01:58:27.119" style="s2">wait it&#39;s unlikely that a meta study on</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.280" end="01:58:28.880" style="s2">wearing crosses would return even a low</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.119" end="01:58:31.520" style="s2">certainty or reducing infection</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.880" end="01:58:33.040" style="s2">i promise you if that study was carried</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.520" end="01:58:35.760" style="s2">out by the catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.040" end="01:58:38.320" style="s2">it definitely would considering the fact</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.760" end="01:58:39.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s not double blind</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.320" end="01:58:41.920" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.920" end="01:58:44.159" style="s2">incentive on behalf of those researchers</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.920" end="01:58:44.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.719" end="01:58:48.480" style="s2">yeah but again it doesn&#39;t matter you see</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.880" end="01:58:50.000" style="s2">i&#39;m just here i&#39;m just here saying stuff</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.480" end="01:58:51.520" style="s2">on a twitch stream right i&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.000" end="01:58:53.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to influence anybody</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.520" end="01:58:54.080" style="s2">politically i&#39;m just trying to find the</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.040" end="01:58:58.480" style="s2">truth right</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.080" end="01:59:04.040" style="s2">um and in general there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.480" end="01:59:07.679" style="s2">um denialism right</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.040" end="01:59:09.440" style="s2">denialism science denialism</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.679" end="01:59:10.719" style="s2">whenever something&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.440" end="01:59:13.920" style="s2">denialism</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.719" end="01:59:16.400" style="s2">i always wonder like why right</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.920" end="01:59:17.199" style="s2">why do they feel this need to brand</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.400" end="01:59:19.599" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.199" end="01:59:22.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no math denialists out there</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.599" end="01:59:23.280" style="s2">right there&#39;s no sun denialists</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.080" end="01:59:25.920" style="s2">every time there have ever been</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.280" end="01:59:29.520" style="s2">denialists of something you always like</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.920" end="01:59:31.520" style="s2">wonder what the actual truth is</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.520" end="01:59:32.880" style="s2">right where where where we know the</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.520" end="01:59:35.360" style="s2">earth is the center of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.880" end="01:59:38.560" style="s2">we&#39;re heliocentric denialists</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.360" end="01:59:45.840" style="s2">well you know turns out the heliocentric</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.560" end="01:59:45.840" style="s2">denialists for right</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.480" end="01:59:51.440" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.520" end="01:59:52.880" style="s2">the psychology of flat earthers is</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.440" end="01:59:54.480" style="s2">somewhat interesting</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.880" end="01:59:56.560" style="s2">um i think a large number of them are</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.480" end="01:59:58.480" style="s2">trolls and a large number of them</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.560" end="02:00:00.400" style="s2">are the kind of people who are very fed</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.480" end="02:00:03.679" style="s2">up with like</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.400" end="02:00:05.199" style="s2">you know being told things by sneering</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.679" end="02:00:06.880" style="s2">smug experts</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.199" end="02:00:08.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of like funny it&#39;s like you</p>

<p begin="02:00:10.320" end="02:00:12.400" style="s2">change bro i don&#39;t even believe the</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.520" end="02:00:16.000" style="s2">earth is</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.400" end="02:00:19.040" style="s2">is round um and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.000" end="02:00:19.760" style="s2">like what it should be viewed as a</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.040" end="02:00:22.880" style="s2">challenge</p>

<p begin="02:00:22.880" end="02:00:25.440" style="s2">you can either like take this person and</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.480" end="02:00:26.000" style="s2">completely exclude them from the</p>

<p begin="02:00:26.000" end="02:00:29.119" style="s2">which i think is a decent approach or</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.920" end="02:00:31.280" style="s2">the other approach is like</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.119" end="02:00:32.719" style="s2">please speak in scientific terms don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.280" end="02:00:34.719" style="s2">make face masks for</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.719" end="02:00:36.639" style="s2">all dot co and say things like take</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.719" end="02:00:38.320" style="s2">action to save lives right</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.639" end="02:00:40.080" style="s2">because when you have that you just you</p>

<p begin="02:01:04.400" end="02:01:08.560" style="s2">and you kind of have two hypothesis now</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.199" end="02:01:10.480" style="s2">right you can be like well this has</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.560" end="02:01:12.480" style="s2">something to do with me</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.480" end="02:01:14.080" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t do well because of bad</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.480" end="02:01:16.080" style="s2">decisions i made</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.080" end="02:01:18.560" style="s2">or you can blame the world or you can</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.080" end="02:01:20.080" style="s2">say the whole world conspired against me</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.560" end="02:01:22.480" style="s2">look they won&#39;t even tell me the truth</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.080" end="02:01:24.719" style="s2">about the earth being round</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.480" end="02:01:26.639" style="s2">and like it&#39;s a psychologically</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.719" end="02:01:29.360" style="s2">protective mechanism</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.639" end="02:01:30.000" style="s2">for some people and it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.360" end="02:01:31.840" style="s2">again what</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.000" end="02:01:33.360" style="s2">what can you do to that i think with</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.840" end="02:01:35.280" style="s2">that kind of person you just have to</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.360" end="02:01:36.800" style="s2">they&#39;re so deluded</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.280" end="02:01:39.040" style="s2">that you just kind of have to exclude</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.800" end="02:01:40.480" style="s2">them from from from civil discourse and</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.040" end="02:01:41.920" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.480" end="02:01:43.280" style="s2">you know hope that they get their</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.920" end="02:01:46.239" style="s2">together and if they don&#39;t you know we</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.280" end="02:01:48.400" style="s2">all make choices in life right</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.239" end="02:01:50.080" style="s2">he&#39;s not a paranoid schizophrenic no</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.400" end="02:01:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s about fundamentally</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.080" end="02:01:54.560" style="s2">things didn&#39;t go his way does he blame</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.480" end="02:01:56.639" style="s2">himself or does he blame the world</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.560" end="02:02:04.400" style="s2">the first step to moving forward is</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.639" end="02:02:06.000" style="s2">blaming yourself um</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.400" end="02:02:07.599" style="s2">so how do i know masks for all is about</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.000" end="02:02:09.840" style="s2">politics and we can we can look at this</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.599" end="02:02:09.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.719" end="02:02:15.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s um let&#39;s just look</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.239" end="02:02:17.360" style="s2">at the outline of this website and i can</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.840" end="02:02:18.080" style="s2">tell you why right away i know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.360" end="02:02:21.360" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.080" end="02:02:23.760" style="s2">right so first off look at this</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.360" end="02:02:25.760" style="s2">featured in right now some people still</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.760" end="02:02:26.719" style="s2">think that these are news organizations</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.760" end="02:02:28.560" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think they are i think</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.719" end="02:02:31.360" style="s2">they&#39;re propaganda outlets right</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.560" end="02:02:32.080" style="s2">i mean i think i think that most most</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.360" end="02:02:33.599" style="s2">liberal people</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.080" end="02:02:35.360" style="s2">would accept that fox news is a</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.599" end="02:02:37.920" style="s2">propaganda outlet right</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.360" end="02:02:38.639" style="s2">um and most conservative people would</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.920" end="02:02:41.040" style="s2">accept that</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.639" end="02:02:42.719" style="s2">cnn and abc are propaganda outlets but</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.040" end="02:02:44.840" style="s2">the truth is they&#39;re all propaganda</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.719" end="02:02:48.719" style="s2">outlets</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.840" end="02:02:51.520" style="s2">um the way that this language is written</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.719" end="02:02:52.000" style="s2">right is like and again i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.520" end="02:02:54.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.000" end="02:02:56.159" style="s2">like it is it is political i think that</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.320" end="02:02:57.920" style="s2">even even uh jeremy would agree with</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.159" end="02:02:59.119" style="s2">this right in saying that this website</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.920" end="02:03:00.639" style="s2">is a political statement not a</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.119" end="02:03:03.040" style="s2">scientific statement right</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.639" end="02:03:04.639" style="s2">learn about the benefits of masks right</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.040" end="02:03:06.239" style="s2">and again it&#39;s the same kind of politics</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.639" end="02:03:09.119" style="s2">when a company wants to sell you</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.239" end="02:03:10.080" style="s2">their product right um learn about the</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.119" end="02:03:12.639" style="s2">benefits of</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.080" end="02:03:14.159" style="s2">bike helmets right i just saw a person</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.639" end="02:03:15.360" style="s2">ride by on a bike with a helmet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.159" end="02:03:17.520" style="s2">why i thought of that</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.360" end="02:03:18.639" style="s2">um but then also like when you have</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.520" end="02:03:21.760" style="s2">language like this like</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.639" end="02:03:23.599" style="s2">take action to save lives this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.760" end="02:03:24.080" style="s2">language of science this is the language</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.599" end="02:03:26.719" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.080" end="02:03:27.679" style="s2">politics and propaganda right if</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.719" end="02:03:29.840" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.679" end="02:03:32.159" style="s2">wears a cloth mask we&#39;re protecting each</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.840" end="02:03:33.360" style="s2">other a highly politicized figure in the</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.159" end="02:03:38.320" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.360" end="02:03:41.520" style="s2">right look at this</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.320" end="02:03:42.080" style="s2">76 percent of americans want masks to be</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.520" end="02:03:44.880" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.080" end="02:03:46.239" style="s2">in business right so let&#39;s replace all</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.880" end="02:03:49.040" style="s2">the things let&#39;s replace</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.239" end="02:03:49.599" style="s2">all the masks here with gold crosses</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.040" end="02:03:52.320" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="02:03:52.320" end="02:03:57.599" style="s2">this entire this entire website</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.679" end="02:04:00.800" style="s2">can is this is this easy for me to go</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.599" end="02:04:00.800" style="s2">and replace things</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.840" end="02:04:11.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.920" end="02:04:18.400" style="s2">uh gold crosses uh can help the spread</p>

<p begin="02:04:43.119" end="02:04:47.679" style="s2">all of this the first statement that</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.679" end="02:04:50.719" style="s2">they make about cloth masks is</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.679" end="02:04:52.560" style="s2">76 percent of americans want masks to be</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.719" end="02:04:54.239" style="s2">required in business that&#39;s not only a</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.560" end="02:04:55.040" style="s2">political statement that&#39;s a democratic</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.239" end="02:04:56.560" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.040" end="02:04:58.480" style="s2">right that&#39;s believing in democratic</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.560" end="02:05:01.040" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.480" end="02:05:02.800" style="s2">um 86 percent of the world population</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.040" end="02:05:05.199" style="s2">lives in places that have a nationwide</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.800" end="02:05:08.159" style="s2">or statewide requirement of masks</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.199" end="02:05:09.040" style="s2">none of this stuff says anything to do</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.159" end="02:05:11.199" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.040" end="02:05:12.480" style="s2">prominent academic leaders have signed a</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.199" end="02:05:14.639" style="s2">letter okay</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.480" end="02:05:16.639" style="s2">now here we get down to here we get down</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.639" end="02:05:17.920" style="s2">to many scientific studies so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.639" end="02:05:20.560" style="s2">what we find right</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.920" end="02:05:21.360" style="s2">now remember again this suffers</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.560" end="02:05:24.000" style="s2">massively</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.360" end="02:05:24.719" style="s2">from the uh the global warming problem</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.000" end="02:05:26.719" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.719" end="02:05:28.800" style="s2">look do i know if global warming is real</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.719" end="02:05:30.000" style="s2">or not i&#39;ve given my opinion on it</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.800" end="02:05:32.560" style="s2">before i think that</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.000" end="02:05:33.040" style="s2">the rise in carbon dioxide is certainly</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.560" end="02:05:34.400" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.040" end="02:05:35.679" style="s2">um and there&#39;s certainly some negative</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.400" end="02:05:37.119" style="s2">effects because of that and the rise of</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.679" end="02:05:38.719" style="s2">carbon dioxide is certainly man-made</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.119" end="02:05:39.760" style="s2">like you can find this very clearly with</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.719" end="02:05:43.760" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.760" end="02:05:47.040" style="s2">um but like you know some of the claims</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.760" end="02:05:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you&#39;re gonna see a lot more</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.040" end="02:05:49.679" style="s2">papers arguing</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.000" end="02:05:51.199" style="s2">one side of it than the other side of it</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.679" end="02:05:53.599" style="s2">do you think masks for all</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.199" end="02:05:54.960" style="s2">would post a neutral scientific paper</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.599" end="02:05:57.440" style="s2">showing that masks really aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.960" end="02:05:57.440" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.480" end="02:06:03.520" style="s2">do you think do you think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.760" end="02:06:05.280" style="s2">do you think they are dispassionate</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.520" end="02:06:07.840" style="s2">investigators of this</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.280" end="02:06:09.920" style="s2">right um now to be fair you know to</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.840" end="02:06:12.239" style="s2">fully disclose biases i generally have a</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.920" end="02:06:16.800" style="s2">bias on the side against this</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.239" end="02:06:18.960" style="s2">on the side against like</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.800" end="02:06:20.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll propagandize for that side well</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.960" end="02:06:23.599" style="s2"> you know i&#39;m a contrarian i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.560" end="02:06:26.639" style="s2">propagandize for the other side right</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.599" end="02:06:27.520" style="s2">um but yeah i mean when your first three</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.639" end="02:06:30.400" style="s2">facts</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.520" end="02:06:31.840" style="s2">talk about are appeals to authority</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.400" end="02:06:34.079" style="s2">appeals to democracy</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.840" end="02:06:36.719" style="s2">and appeals to government&#39;s correctness</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.079" end="02:06:36.719" style="s2">that&#39;s junk</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.280" end="02:06:41.040" style="s2">right they wouldn&#39;t cite opposing</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.719" end="02:06:42.800" style="s2">studies i would if somebody shows me a</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.040" end="02:06:43.520" style="s2">real study which shows the effectiveness</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.800" end="02:06:45.679" style="s2">of masks</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.520" end="02:06:47.360" style="s2">i promise you i will post it on here</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.679" end="02:06:51.040" style="s2">right now i will read it</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.360" end="02:06:54.880" style="s2">and i&#39;ll be like damn okay i was wrong</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.040" end="02:06:56.159" style="s2">um but yeah and i&#39;ll give you know just</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.880" end="02:06:58.320" style="s2">pre-registration i&#39;ll tell you what i</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.159" end="02:06:59.199" style="s2">want the study to be i&#39;d like this study</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.320" end="02:07:03.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.199" end="02:07:06.079" style="s2">a it can&#39;t be double blind but at least</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.280" end="02:07:07.840" style="s2">uh controlled and randomized so we have</p>

<p begin="02:07:07.840" end="02:07:11.360" style="s2">she&#39;s got to do a big study probably</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.119" end="02:07:13.040" style="s2">like 10 000 volunteers in a city</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.360" end="02:07:14.639" style="s2">sign up we randomized half of them to</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.040" end="02:07:15.199" style="s2">wear masks half of them to not wear</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.639" end="02:07:16.400" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.199" end="02:07:17.679" style="s2">and then we look at the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.400" end="02:07:19.280" style="s2">infection rates and the mask squares</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.679" end="02:07:21.040" style="s2">versus the non-mask squares</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.280" end="02:07:22.639" style="s2">right now unfortunately it&#39;s not double</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.040" end="02:07:24.079" style="s2">blind um</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.639" end="02:07:26.719" style="s2">so you might say that the people wear</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.079" end="02:07:28.079" style="s2">masks take less risks because they know</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.719" end="02:07:30.320" style="s2">they&#39;re in the mass group</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.079" end="02:07:32.320" style="s2">or you might say the people with masks</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.320" end="02:07:33.840" style="s2">take more risks</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.320" end="02:07:35.360" style="s2">because they feel like they&#39;re protected</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.840" end="02:07:37.040" style="s2">because they&#39;re wearing a mask</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.360" end="02:07:38.639" style="s2">but either way if somebody posts that</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.040" end="02:07:41.040" style="s2">study</p>

<p begin="02:10:16.079" end="02:10:19.360" style="s2">right i think a lot of people would</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.679" end="02:10:23.679" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s consensual people are</p>

<p begin="02:10:23.679" end="02:10:27.119" style="s2">i think that a study with poison like</p>

<p begin="02:10:38.239" end="02:10:42.480" style="s2">what i&#39;m looking for</p>

<p begin="02:10:46.320" end="02:10:49.440" style="s2">what i&#39;m looking for is a study on</p>

<p begin="02:10:53.119" end="02:10:58.960" style="s2">of surgical masks in public right why</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.320" end="02:11:02.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t they allow such studies</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.960" end="02:11:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous again</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.000" end="02:11:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s volunteers who fully understand the</p>

<p begin="02:12:38.320" end="02:12:42.320" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s certainly correlated light</p>

<p begin="02:14:38.840" end="02:14:41.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.639" end="02:14:52.400" style="s2">yeah causality is a fun thing to think</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.840" end="02:14:57.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.840" end="02:15:00.639" style="s2">but i mean i remember reading his books</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.599" end="02:15:00.639" style="s2">and i remember like</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.119" end="02:15:04.560" style="s2">i remember coming away kind of with the</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.560" end="02:15:07.760" style="s2">contrarian opinion that like</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.560" end="02:15:10.480" style="s2">correlation is causation</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.760" end="02:15:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly not this is counter factual</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.480" end="02:15:14.159" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.360" end="02:15:14.800" style="s2">or maybe there is no way to learn this</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.159" end="02:15:17.520" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.800" end="02:15:19.520" style="s2">true causation outside of correlation uh</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.520" end="02:15:21.679" style="s2">you could imagine that there is a deity</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.520" end="02:15:23.520" style="s2">in the sky who watches you flipping</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.679" end="02:15:25.199" style="s2">light switches and then turns the light</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.520" end="02:15:28.239" style="s2">on and it&#39;s the deity that actually does</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.199" end="02:15:30.639" style="s2">it and not like the switch</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.239" end="02:15:31.440" style="s2">um but then at that point what kind of</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.639" end="02:15:33.040" style="s2">study do i want</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.440" end="02:15:34.840" style="s2">what i&#39;m looking for is a large</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.040" end="02:15:36.079" style="s2">randomized controlled study of</p>

<p begin="02:15:36.079" end="02:15:41.440" style="s2">plus zinc there&#39;s one registered on</p>

<p begin="02:15:41.440" end="02:15:51.840" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have results mostly yet</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.840" end="02:16:33.840" style="s2">wow</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.519" end="02:16:47.840" style="s2">let&#39;s see what the exercises are</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.319" end="02:16:52.960" style="s2">as i re-read genesis for the hundredth</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.559" end="02:16:57.040" style="s2">time i noticed a nuance that</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.960" end="02:16:58.479" style="s2">i don&#39;t know uh so where are we popping</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.040" end="02:17:01.519" style="s2">off the stack</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.479" end="02:17:04.319" style="s2">coronavirus immunity is is short-lasted</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.519" end="02:17:04.319" style="s2">it&#39;s short-lasting</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.120" end="02:17:22.240" style="s2">um what percent of people get a cold</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.760" end="02:17:22.240" style="s2">each year</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.719" end="02:17:31.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s look quickly let&#39;s look um</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.840" end="02:17:45.679" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.080" end="02:17:45.679" style="s2">really one to three times</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.559" end="02:17:56.319" style="s2">i mean one thing that&#39;ll be cool that if</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.280" end="02:17:59.359" style="s2">we end up getting</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.319" end="02:18:01.679" style="s2">out of this if we get a vaccine</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.359" end="02:18:03.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not bullish on a vaccine for a bunch</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.679" end="02:18:04.880" style="s2">of reasons but if we do</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.200" end="02:18:06.639" style="s2">i wonder if these vaccines will work on</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.880" end="02:18:10.160" style="s2">colds too</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.639" end="02:18:11.760" style="s2">i hate getting colds</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.160" end="02:18:14.639" style="s2">um all right we&#39;re done we&#39;re done we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.760" end="02:18:16.080" style="s2">done oh here we go</p>

<p begin="02:18:18.479" end="02:18:25.359" style="s2">the study that would convince me is a</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.160" end="02:18:28.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s totally not unethical to do</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.359" end="02:18:28.559" style="s2">uh okay here we go</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.080" end="02:18:34.160" style="s2">do we have no results posted</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.479" end="02:18:37.840" style="s2">here&#39;s another study that we&#39;re waiting</p>

<p begin="02:19:08.240" end="02:19:11.519" style="s2">is this the study i wanted</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.240" end="02:19:23.339" style="s2">huh okay</p>

<p begin="02:20:04.240" end="02:20:17.040" style="s2">or was it the people who chose to wear</p>

<p begin="02:20:17.040" end="02:20:22.880" style="s2">um this study is the first rct of cloth</p>

<p begin="02:20:33.600" end="02:20:37.439" style="s2">looking mask study and what do we find</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.920" end="02:20:48.000" style="s2">oh it&#39;s old too</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.160" end="02:20:50.560" style="s2">um randomized oh they have a control</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.000" end="02:20:50.560" style="s2">group too</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.200" end="02:20:59.840" style="s2">your control group didn&#39;t wear masks</p>

<p begin="02:21:11.680" end="02:21:16.479" style="s2">include mask use okay</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.920" end="02:21:18.160" style="s2">oh irb deemed it unethical to ask</p>
<p begin="02:21:16.479" end="02:21:20.399" style="s2">participants to not wear a mask</p>

<p begin="02:21:23.439" end="02:21:27.840" style="s2">so i questioned the control group but</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.640" end="02:21:54.000" style="s2">i mean just looking at just looking at</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.040" end="02:21:56.800" style="s2">those numbers nothing else</p>

<p begin="02:22:19.280" end="02:22:23.840" style="s2">control group was slightly smaller</p>

<p begin="02:22:54.000" end="02:23:06.399" style="s2">so the medical mask arm</p>

<p begin="02:23:09.280" end="02:23:16.399" style="s2">all right so we have uh then</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.319" end="02:23:19.840" style="s2">equals medical mask uh cloth mask</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.399" end="02:23:19.840" style="s2">and control</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.760" end="02:23:28.319" style="s2">then the number of people who got a</p>

<p begin="02:23:28.319" end="02:23:38.000" style="s2">was medical maths cloth masks control</p>

<p begin="02:23:42.080" end="02:23:45.359" style="s2">and let&#39;s actually also multiply that by</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.439" end="02:23:50.319" style="s2">100 so we can get percent</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.359" end="02:23:53.760" style="s2">so this is the oh i&#39;m in python 2.</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.319" end="02:23:57.920" style="s2">oh i&#39;m in python 2. okay</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.760" end="02:23:59.760" style="s2">so wearing medical masks 3.2</p>

<p begin="02:25:15.200" end="02:25:21.760" style="s2">can we show statistical significance</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.399" end="02:25:24.080" style="s2">um that that can we show first off that</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.760" end="02:25:25.280" style="s2">well medical mask is high is is lower</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.080" end="02:25:27.280" style="s2">rate than control</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.280" end="02:25:29.120" style="s2">so is this a statistically significant</p>
<p begin="02:25:27.280" end="02:25:32.160" style="s2">amount given that denominator</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.120" end="02:25:33.840" style="s2">and then cloth masks got more infection</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.160" end="02:25:35.760" style="s2">can we show that this is this</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.840" end="02:25:39.840" style="s2">statistically significant</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.760" end="02:25:39.840" style="s2">there&#39;s like ways to do this</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.080" end="02:25:45.120" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know it off the top of my</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.000" end="02:25:45.120" style="s2">head i should</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.920" end="02:25:50.399" style="s2">all right we will now calculate the z</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.840" end="02:25:53.840" style="s2">score</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.240" end="02:26:07.840" style="s2">okay population mean</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.080" end="02:26:07.840" style="s2">sample mean</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.760" end="02:26:24.319" style="s2">calculate a z-score for any</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.760" end="02:26:25.200" style="s2">raw value of x so what are how do i do</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.319" end="02:26:28.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.200" end="02:26:28.240" style="s2">who knows how to do this</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.479" end="02:26:33.520" style="s2">again you want to show me protecting</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.000" end="02:26:38.240" style="s2">other people post</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.520" end="02:26:38.240" style="s2">the the the the rule for evidence</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.120" end="02:26:42.960" style="s2">oh okay wait do we have do we have a</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.040" end="02:26:44.479" style="s2">good do we have results on this one do</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.960" end="02:26:49.840" style="s2">we have an actual good trial on zinc</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.479" end="02:26:49.840" style="s2">plus hydrochloroquinolone</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.560" end="02:26:56.399" style="s2">um no oh sorry i closed twitch</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.800" end="02:27:04.319" style="s2">this is just kind of embarrassing</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.160" end="02:27:05.920" style="s2">can we post that study again that one</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.319" end="02:27:09.200" style="s2">looked good</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.920" end="02:27:09.200" style="s2">sorry i opened that in the wrong</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.640" end="02:27:17.840" style="s2">browser alright we got it</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.560" end="02:27:23.680" style="s2">um does zinc supplementation enhance the</p>
<p begin="02:27:22.000" end="02:27:26.960" style="s2">clinical effectiveness so let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.680" end="02:27:26.960" style="s2">look and see if there&#39;s a good study or</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.840" end="02:27:31.840" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.280" end="02:27:38.560" style="s2">great great hypothesis oh we proposed to</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.040" end="02:27:44.160" style="s2">amend but i don&#39;t think they actually</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.560" end="02:27:47.680" style="s2">did the study</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.160" end="02:27:51.200" style="s2">uh no but yet you claim</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.680" end="02:27:54.840" style="s2">oh estimated by 31st of july okay use</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.200" end="02:27:56.000" style="s2">r and use p norm to get the cumulative</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.840" end="02:27:59.439" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.000" end="02:28:05.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know r</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.439" end="02:28:05.040" style="s2">begin bot welcome r p norm</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.800" end="02:28:13.840" style="s2">distribution function all right</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.840" end="02:28:13.840" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.800" end="02:28:19.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen this stuff before i&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.439" end="02:28:22.399" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.920" end="02:28:25.280" style="s2">what this stuff means i mean the</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.399" end="02:28:28.319" style="s2">question i&#39;m asking like is</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.280" end="02:28:31.120" style="s2">is it statistically significant can we</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.319" end="02:28:33.120" style="s2">say with statistical significance that</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.120" end="02:28:34.960" style="s2">cloth masks make you more likely to</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.120" end="02:28:35.359" style="s2">catch a virus than wearing no mask at</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.960" end="02:28:36.640" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.359" end="02:28:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;d be that&#39;d be some if we could</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.640" end="02:28:42.240" style="s2">prove that we&#39;re doing science boys</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.800" end="02:28:43.520" style="s2">we&#39;re doing science i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.240" end="02:28:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s highlighted with</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.520" end="02:28:50.640" style="s2">cannot assume normality especially with</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.520" end="02:28:55.120" style="s2">the crucial wallace tests np</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.640" end="02:28:57.280" style="s2">dot cumulative right</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.120" end="02:28:58.560" style="s2">one nominal variable and one ranked</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.280" end="02:29:01.280" style="s2">variable damn i don&#39;t know any</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.560" end="02:29:01.280" style="s2">statistics</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.840" end="02:29:09.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.520" end="02:29:16.640" style="s2">wait why can&#39;t we assume that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:15.200" end="02:29:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s randomly distributed why can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.640" end="02:29:21.359" style="s2">assume that it&#39;s a normal distribution</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.520" end="02:29:23.840" style="s2">what&#39;s the issue with which study for</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.359" end="02:29:23.840" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.080" end="02:29:32.319" style="s2">because this isn&#39;t testing this is</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.359" end="02:29:34.720" style="s2">testing</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.319" end="02:29:36.000" style="s2">hypothetical things that may correlate</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.720" end="02:29:38.240" style="s2">with the spread of a virus</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.000" end="02:29:39.520" style="s2">right i don&#39;t want to hear about oh it</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.240" end="02:29:42.399" style="s2">like it it</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.520" end="02:29:43.680" style="s2">changes the particle distribution of</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.399" end="02:29:45.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.680" end="02:29:47.120" style="s2">you&#39;d also then have to show that</p>
<p begin="02:29:45.200" end="02:29:48.880" style="s2">changing the particle distribution</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.120" end="02:29:51.200" style="s2">affects the virus the study i want to</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.880" end="02:29:54.479" style="s2">see looks like this</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.200" end="02:29:56.560" style="s2">right you have a medical math group</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.479" end="02:29:58.960" style="s2">a medical mass group a cloth mass group</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.560" end="02:30:00.640" style="s2">and a control group</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.960" end="02:30:02.319" style="s2">hopefully there&#39;s no other difference</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.640" end="02:30:03.520" style="s2">between those three groups now be aware</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.319" end="02:30:04.000" style="s2">that people know which mask they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.520" end="02:30:06.240" style="s2">wearing so</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.000" end="02:30:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not truly blinded but like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.240" end="02:30:10.479" style="s2">see a better way to do this study</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.760" end="02:30:11.920" style="s2">show me this and then show me how many</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.479" end="02:30:14.399" style="s2">of them got infected</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.920" end="02:30:15.760" style="s2">right if you and then and then do the</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.399" end="02:30:18.000" style="s2">statistical analysis</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.760" end="02:30:19.520" style="s2">and then you can show if masks reduce</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.000" end="02:30:21.200" style="s2">the spread of coronavirus or not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.520" end="02:30:22.560" style="s2">simple study to do and it&#39;s really not</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.200" end="02:30:24.720" style="s2">unethical</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.560" end="02:30:26.080" style="s2">even if you just did a control study</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.720" end="02:30:26.640" style="s2">where you did the same thing here if</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.080" end="02:30:28.399" style="s2">they say</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.640" end="02:30:29.920" style="s2">forcing people to wear masks you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.399" end="02:30:32.560" style="s2">do just do</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.920" end="02:30:33.520" style="s2">um you know one group of people can do</p>
<p begin="02:30:32.560" end="02:30:34.720" style="s2">whatever they want</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.520" end="02:30:36.560" style="s2">and the other group of people should</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.720" end="02:30:37.439" style="s2">comply and then we can measure it we</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.560" end="02:30:40.800" style="s2">could show</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.439" end="02:30:43.120" style="s2">effectively what this graph is um</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.800" end="02:30:44.800" style="s2">and then you know we can see what</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.120" end="02:30:46.080" style="s2">percent of people get viruses we can</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.800" end="02:30:47.920" style="s2">check for all different kinds of viruses</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.080" end="02:30:49.359" style="s2">too not just coronavirus</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.920" end="02:30:51.840" style="s2">um and figure out what masks are</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.359" end="02:30:51.840" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.200" end="02:30:56.800" style="s2">uh couldn&#39;t the masks all look the same</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.880" end="02:30:58.560" style="s2">yeah i mean ideally the control group is</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.800" end="02:31:01.840" style="s2">a mask that looks the same but actually</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.560" end="02:31:01.840" style="s2">changes nothing</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.960" end="02:31:08.160" style="s2">read the bottom of this from the world</p>
<p begin="02:31:05.120" end="02:31:08.160" style="s2">health organization</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.800" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">again a lot of questions about the world</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.840" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">health organization</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.560" end="02:31:21.600" style="s2">at the bottom of this</p>
<p begin="02:31:26.000" end="02:31:28.880" style="s2">this isn&#39;t this is this is political</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.600" end="02:31:29.359" style="s2">this isn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t matter what it</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.880" end="02:31:30.800" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.359" end="02:31:33.280" style="s2">i think the world health organization</p>
<p begin="02:31:30.800" end="02:31:34.960" style="s2">actually has uh</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.280" end="02:31:36.399" style="s2">an opinion that that that widespread</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.960" end="02:31:37.439" style="s2">mass use doesn&#39;t do anything but like</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.399" end="02:31:39.200" style="s2">either way</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.439" end="02:31:40.800" style="s2">again it&#39;s it&#39;s political propaganda so</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.200" end="02:31:44.880" style="s2">i can&#39;t trust them either way</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.800" end="02:31:46.960" style="s2">what i do trust is this study</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.880" end="02:31:48.720" style="s2">a cluster randomized trial of cloth</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.960" end="02:31:49.920" style="s2">masks compared with medical masks do it</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.720" end="02:31:57.840" style="s2">in healthcare workers do it in the</p>
<p begin="02:31:49.920" end="02:31:57.840" style="s2">general population</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.760" end="02:32:03.040" style="s2">it says cloth masks are not recommended</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.600" end="02:32:06.560" style="s2">under any circumstance</p>
<p begin="02:32:03.040" end="02:32:08.399" style="s2">like again because the world health</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.560" end="02:32:10.800" style="s2">organization says something</p>
<p begin="02:32:08.399" end="02:32:12.000" style="s2">you do have to um what&#39;s the the classic</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.800" end="02:32:15.280" style="s2">this is a less wrong</p>
<p begin="02:32:12.000" end="02:32:19.760" style="s2">um idiot says the sun out</p>
<p begin="02:32:15.280" end="02:32:25.840" style="s2">says the sun is out</p>
<p begin="02:32:19.760" end="02:32:25.840" style="s2">what&#39;s uh here we go</p>
<p begin="02:32:27.760" end="02:32:31.200" style="s2">yeah uh</p>

<p begin="02:32:41.520" end="02:32:45.359" style="s2">i liked that book when i was younger</p>

<p begin="02:32:51.040" end="02:32:54.880" style="s2">reverse stupidity is not intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:32:59.280" end="02:33:05.680" style="s2">um are healthcare workers really a good</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.800" end="02:33:05.680" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.840" end="02:33:21.840" style="s2">ah</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.920" end="02:33:31.520" style="s2">the masks masquerade article from to lab</p>
<p begin="02:33:28.399" end="02:33:33.439" style="s2">again i agree</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.520" end="02:33:35.359" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s look quickly at what he says</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.439" end="02:33:37.520" style="s2">but again regardless</p>
<p begin="02:33:35.359" end="02:33:39.439" style="s2">whether he agrees or doesn&#39;t and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:33:37.520" end="02:33:40.800" style="s2">know the masked masquerade seems like he</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.439" end="02:33:43.439" style="s2">agrees with me</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.800" end="02:33:49.840" style="s2">but again that&#39;s not evidence right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.439" end="02:33:49.840" style="s2">not evidence either way</p>
<p begin="02:33:51.760" end="02:33:58.080" style="s2">ah he&#39;s pro man again god pro mask and</p>
<p begin="02:33:55.520" end="02:33:58.080" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="02:33:58.800" end="02:34:06.000" style="s2">this is this is political</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.399" end="02:34:06.000" style="s2">this is it oh we got to study</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.280" end="02:34:13.359" style="s2">face mask use in the control of</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.960" end="02:34:15.840" style="s2">respiratory</p>
<p begin="02:34:13.359" end="02:34:18.479" style="s2">okay it was done a while ago let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="02:34:15.840" end="02:34:18.479" style="s2">what we got</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.720" end="02:34:30.640" style="s2">um we studied a</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.160" end="02:34:33.280" style="s2">randomized comparing surgical masks and</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.640" end="02:34:33.280" style="s2">no mask</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.080" end="02:34:39.840" style="s2">adherence to mask use</p>
<p begin="02:34:37.439" end="02:34:41.680" style="s2">significantly reduce the risk this is</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.840" end="02:34:46.080" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.680" end="02:34:46.080" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see what we got um</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.800" end="02:34:50.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a smaller study</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.399" end="02:34:57.920" style="s2">all right let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s post let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.920" end="02:34:59.359" style="s2">let&#39;s add a we&#39;ll add a mask section to</p>
<p begin="02:34:57.920" end="02:35:00.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.359" end="02:35:03.040" style="s2">guys you know you might you might you</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.880" end="02:35:04.960" style="s2">might change my mind by the end of this</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.040" end="02:35:07.600" style="s2">legit change my mind not like louder</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.960" end="02:35:07.600" style="s2">with crowder</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.840" end="02:35:16.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:35:12.720" end="02:35:17.040" style="s2">i think i mean i&#39;m put it this way if i</p>
<p begin="02:35:16.080" end="02:35:19.760" style="s2">had to assign</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.040" end="02:35:20.800" style="s2">uh confidence values to these things i</p>
<p begin="02:35:19.760" end="02:35:23.840" style="s2">am 90</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.800" end="02:35:24.880" style="s2">confidence on the uselessness of cloth</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.840" end="02:35:28.240" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.880" end="02:35:31.520" style="s2">i&#39;m 60 percent confident i&#39;m confident</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.240" end="02:35:34.399" style="s2">on the uselessness of uh surgical masks</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.520" end="02:35:35.840" style="s2">and i&#39;m one percent confident on the</p>
<p begin="02:35:34.399" end="02:35:41.840" style="s2">uselessness</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.840" end="02:35:41.840" style="s2">of real uh respirators</p>
<p begin="02:35:44.720" end="02:35:47.760" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see the study</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.240" end="02:35:52.720" style="s2">face mask use and control of respiratory</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.640" end="02:35:55.120" style="s2">virus transmission in households</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.720" end="02:35:56.720" style="s2">so i would guess that i mean first let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:55.120" end="02:35:59.439" style="s2">see if the viruses</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.720" end="02:35:59.439" style="s2">are uh</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.280" end="02:36:07.200" style="s2">so this is talking about rhino i think</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.040" end="02:36:10.640" style="s2">most people got rhinoviruses</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.200" end="02:36:11.920" style="s2">from this study rhinoviruses are cold</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.640" end="02:36:13.760" style="s2">let&#39;s just quickly look them up because</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.920" end="02:36:16.560" style="s2">i mentioned that again</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.760" end="02:36:18.240" style="s2">uh talking about you know 20 percent of</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.560" end="02:36:22.960" style="s2">colds are caused by coronaviruses and i</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.240" end="02:36:24.640" style="s2">just repeat that</p>
<p begin="02:36:22.960" end="02:36:26.560" style="s2">um is there any reason to think that a</p>
<p begin="02:36:24.640" end="02:36:27.840" style="s2">rhinovirus would be a smaller or larger</p>
<p begin="02:36:26.560" end="02:36:30.399" style="s2">particle</p>
<p begin="02:36:27.840" end="02:36:30.399" style="s2">probably not</p>
<p begin="02:36:35.520" end="02:36:39.200" style="s2">yeah so most of the viruses we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="02:36:37.040" end="02:36:42.560" style="s2">know what is this by the way</p>
<p begin="02:36:39.200" end="02:36:42.560" style="s2">how should i be afraid of this</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.200" end="02:36:51.840" style="s2">another cold virus interesting</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.640" end="02:36:54.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:36:57.640" end="02:37:02.000" style="s2">286 exposed adults from 143 households</p>
<p begin="02:37:00.800" end="02:37:03.280" style="s2">had been exposed to a child with</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.000" end="02:37:04.319" style="s2">clinical respiratory illness were</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.280" end="02:37:07.280" style="s2">recruited</p>
<p begin="02:37:04.319" end="02:37:10.000" style="s2">we found that adherence to mask use</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.280" end="02:37:10.319" style="s2">significantly reduced the risk but less</p>
<p begin="02:37:10.000" end="02:37:12.960" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="02:37:10.319" end="02:37:15.600" style="s2">50 percent of participants wore masks</p>
<p begin="02:37:12.960" end="02:37:17.760" style="s2">most of the time</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.600" end="02:37:20.000" style="s2">we concluded that household use of face</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.760" end="02:37:22.880" style="s2">masks is associated with low adherence</p>
<p begin="02:37:20.000" end="02:37:24.640" style="s2">and is ineffective for controlling</p>
<p begin="02:37:22.880" end="02:37:27.520" style="s2">okay i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.640" end="02:37:27.520" style="s2">different question</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.000" end="02:37:38.240" style="s2">um surgical masks</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.439" end="02:37:38.240" style="s2">p2 masks what&#39;s a p2 mask</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.640" end="02:37:42.240" style="s2">oh p2s or n95s okay</p>
<p begin="02:37:42.960" end="02:37:46.800" style="s2">oh yeah my opinion on n95 so i gave a</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.120" end="02:37:47.680" style="s2">yeah i gave a one percent chance and i</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.800" end="02:37:50.479" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="02:37:47.680" end="02:37:51.439" style="s2">i would give a 10 chance to n95s being</p>
<p begin="02:37:50.479" end="02:37:53.359" style="s2">useless</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.439" end="02:37:55.200" style="s2">um meaning i would give a 90 chance to</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.359" end="02:37:57.840" style="s2">n95s being useful</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.200" end="02:37:58.800" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say let&#39;s say let&#39;s say 70 30</p>
<p begin="02:37:57.840" end="02:38:01.600" style="s2">let&#39;s say 30</p>
<p begin="02:37:58.800" end="02:38:02.560" style="s2">chance that these are useful and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:38:01.600" end="02:38:04.080" style="s2">say a 10</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.560" end="02:38:06.160" style="s2">chance now you know what we&#39;ll give low</p>
<p begin="02:38:04.080" end="02:38:07.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll give lower i&#39;m i&#39;m as unconfident</p>
<p begin="02:38:06.160" end="02:38:10.640" style="s2">in cloth masks</p>
<p begin="02:38:07.200" end="02:38:15.840" style="s2">as i am confident and surgical now in in</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.640" end="02:38:15.840" style="s2">in in p100 respirators</p>
<p begin="02:38:18.880" end="02:38:28.160" style="s2">um okay control</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.720" end="02:38:33.359" style="s2">surgical p2</p>
<p begin="02:38:28.160" end="02:38:37.439" style="s2">uh seems sufficiently randomized</p>
<p begin="02:38:33.359" end="02:38:37.439" style="s2">um adherence wasn&#39;t great</p>
<p begin="02:38:38.319" end="02:38:43.840" style="s2">people complained about it but here we</p>
<p begin="02:38:40.240" end="02:38:43.840" style="s2">go here&#39;s here&#39;s the real study</p>
<p begin="02:38:44.399" end="02:38:48.319" style="s2">control group wait</p>
<p begin="02:38:50.399" end="02:38:59.120" style="s2">control group has zero</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.240" end="02:39:04.560" style="s2">confirmed infections surgical masks</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.120" end="02:39:11.840" style="s2">has six and p2 masks has eight</p>
<p begin="02:39:04.560" end="02:39:11.840" style="s2">um what do they claim this shows</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.880" end="02:39:27.280" style="s2">am i reading this wrong</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.880" end="02:39:28.960" style="s2">no this isn&#39;t the hanoi study this is uh</p>
<p begin="02:39:27.280" end="02:39:31.040" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="02:39:28.960" end="02:39:33.840" style="s2">this is a study that claimed to show</p>
<p begin="02:39:31.040" end="02:39:38.080" style="s2">that it was effective</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.840" end="02:39:39.359" style="s2">yet i see the opposite</p>
<p begin="02:39:38.080" end="02:39:41.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="02:39:39.359" end="02:39:41.600" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.439" end="02:39:52.800" style="s2">they do show that a confounding factor</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.439" end="02:39:55.520" style="s2">in the study is that they had low</p>
<p begin="02:39:52.800" end="02:39:55.520" style="s2">compliance</p>
<p begin="02:39:58.240" end="02:40:02.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying by the way i&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="02:40:00.000" end="02:40:03.840" style="s2">to show that people with masks are more</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.000" end="02:40:05.760" style="s2">likely to get the virus though the via</p>
<p begin="02:40:03.840" end="02:40:06.960" style="s2">the hanoi study does seem</p>
<p begin="02:40:05.760" end="02:40:08.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this was referred to as the</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.960" end="02:40:09.359" style="s2">hanoi study i didn&#39;t realize this was</p>
<p begin="02:40:08.240" end="02:40:10.640" style="s2">like a big thing</p>
<p begin="02:40:09.359" end="02:40:13.439" style="s2">like people have like names for the</p>
<p begin="02:40:10.640" end="02:40:13.439" style="s2">studies and stuff</p>
<p begin="02:40:19.359" end="02:40:22.720" style="s2">the control group probably stayed inside</p>
<p begin="02:40:21.840" end="02:40:26.240" style="s2">well so</p>
<p begin="02:40:22.720" end="02:40:26.880" style="s2">again um this is about households right</p>
<p begin="02:40:26.240" end="02:40:29.359" style="s2">this is about</p>
<p begin="02:40:26.880" end="02:40:31.040" style="s2">kids who had some sickness and whether</p>
<p begin="02:40:29.359" end="02:40:32.800" style="s2">you should wear a mask if your kid gets</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.040" end="02:40:36.399" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="02:40:32.800" end="02:40:39.600" style="s2">so staying inside right again</p>
<p begin="02:40:36.399" end="02:40:43.680" style="s2">i really am open to</p>
<p begin="02:40:39.600" end="02:40:45.200" style="s2">to to to to evidence and to a study</p>
<p begin="02:40:43.680" end="02:40:48.399" style="s2">i&#39;ve been linked to two things that i</p>
<p begin="02:40:45.200" end="02:40:51.600" style="s2">thought were decent studies</p>
<p begin="02:40:48.399" end="02:40:52.800" style="s2">and then like i&#39;m also open to being</p>
<p begin="02:40:51.600" end="02:40:55.120" style="s2">told that i&#39;m reading these studies</p>
<p begin="02:40:52.800" end="02:40:55.120" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="02:40:56.000" end="02:41:01.840" style="s2">but what i&#39;m seeing here is that</p>
<p begin="02:40:59.760" end="02:41:02.880" style="s2">more people again okay so here the here</p>
<p begin="02:41:01.840" end="02:41:05.520" style="s2">the mask group</p>
<p begin="02:41:02.880" end="02:41:06.479" style="s2">is uh is twice as large as the non-mask</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.520" end="02:41:09.120" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="02:41:06.479" end="02:41:10.080" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know what the parenthesis</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.120" end="02:41:17.840" style="s2">mean but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="02:41:10.080" end="02:41:17.840" style="s2">two versus seven and here</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.479" end="02:41:24.960" style="s2">check this out we got another one i see</p>
<p begin="02:41:22.640" end="02:41:28.000" style="s2">the word policy in that name</p>
<p begin="02:41:24.960" end="02:41:28.000" style="s2">i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="02:41:28.840" end="02:41:31.840" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.040" end="02:41:37.439" style="s2">well to see political propaganda got the</p>
<p begin="02:41:35.840" end="02:41:40.479" style="s2">word policy in it again</p>

<p begin="03:28:26.479" end="03:28:31.040" style="s2">all right it seems like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="03:28:27.920" end="03:28:34.960" style="s2">more to learn about self-amplifying rna</p>
<p begin="03:28:31.040" end="03:28:37.120" style="s2">but my thoughts on viruses</p>
<p begin="03:28:34.960" end="03:28:39.680" style="s2">uh my thoughts on vaccines are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:28:37.120" end="03:28:41.200" style="s2">still going to be a bad long time</p>
<p begin="03:28:39.680" end="03:28:43.439" style="s2">oh interim results alright what do we</p>
<p begin="03:28:41.200" end="03:28:46.399" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="03:28:43.439" end="03:28:47.680" style="s2">an rna vaccine let&#39;s read the study if</p>
<p begin="03:28:46.399" end="03:28:53.840" style="s2">anyone wants to link studies we&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="03:28:47.680" end="03:28:53.840" style="s2">some studies</p>
<p begin="03:29:03.520" end="03:29:06.560" style="s2">and they really got to do exposure</p>
<p begin="03:29:05.040" end="03:29:08.960" style="s2">studies you know those are the real</p>
<p begin="03:29:06.560" end="03:29:08.960" style="s2">studies</p>
<p begin="03:29:16.239" end="03:29:19.439" style="s2">we&#39;re done looking at mask studies</p>
<p begin="03:29:17.840" end="03:29:21.200" style="s2">unless you find exactly the one i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="03:29:19.439" end="03:29:22.720" style="s2">looking for now you know what</p>
<p begin="03:29:21.200" end="03:29:25.040" style="s2"> i almost want to do this study i</p>
<p begin="03:29:22.720" end="03:29:27.760" style="s2">could fund this study</p>
<p begin="03:29:25.040" end="03:29:27.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="03:29:28.800" end="03:29:31.840" style="s2">you need a lot of people because most</p>
<p begin="03:29:30.399" end="03:29:33.600" style="s2">people don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="03:29:31.840" end="03:29:35.120" style="s2">but in a place with a high infection</p>
<p begin="03:29:33.600" end="03:29:37.840" style="s2">rate</p>
<p begin="03:29:35.120" end="03:29:38.640" style="s2">i&#39;d like to recruit like 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="03:29:37.840" end="03:29:40.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="03:29:38.640" end="03:29:43.359" style="s2">have half of them wear cloth masks</p>
<p begin="03:29:40.880" end="03:29:46.319" style="s2">always and half of them wear cloth masks</p>
<p begin="03:29:43.359" end="03:29:49.200" style="s2">as little as they possibly can</p>
<p begin="03:29:46.319" end="03:29:50.399" style="s2">and then we see how many people get</p>
<p begin="03:29:49.200" end="03:29:53.439" style="s2">chronovirus</p>
<p begin="03:29:50.399" end="03:29:53.439" style="s2">that&#39;s the study i want</p>
<p begin="03:29:54.000" end="03:30:00.800" style="s2">so until i see that study uh</p>
<p begin="03:29:58.000" end="03:30:03.840" style="s2">i&#39;m bearish on uh yeah we&#39;re at we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:30:00.800" end="03:30:06.720" style="s2">we&#39;re over mask stuff</p>
<p begin="03:30:03.840" end="03:30:09.120" style="s2">um we looked at a bunch of studies</p>
<p begin="03:30:06.720" end="03:30:10.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t find conclusive evidence anyway</p>
<p begin="03:30:09.120" end="03:30:12.800" style="s2">and i think it comes down to whether you</p>
<p begin="03:30:10.800" end="03:30:14.880" style="s2">think that the default should be masks</p>
<p begin="03:30:12.800" end="03:30:16.080" style="s2">or the default should be no masks</p>
<p begin="03:30:14.880" end="03:30:18.319" style="s2">and god you know that actually is a</p>
<p begin="03:30:16.080" end="03:30:21.200" style="s2">political question so</p>
<p begin="03:30:18.319" end="03:30:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s all hopeless</p>
<p begin="03:30:24.880" end="03:30:28.479" style="s2">can i glance at this in common testing</p>
<p begin="03:30:27.439" end="03:30:32.800" style="s2">the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="03:30:28.479" end="03:30:35.040" style="s2">homemade masks right again</p>
<p begin="03:30:32.800" end="03:30:36.239" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna pre i want to see that that</p>
<p begin="03:30:35.040" end="03:30:37.600" style="s2">this i want to see this</p>
<p begin="03:30:36.239" end="03:30:39.840" style="s2">i want to see this if it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="03:30:37.600" end="03:30:39.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="03:30:40.160" end="03:30:45.120" style="s2">no no i don&#39;t want filtration no i want</p>
<p begin="03:30:43.359" end="03:30:47.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="03:30:45.120" end="03:30:50.319" style="s2">i want this i want a graph that looks</p>
<p begin="03:30:47.920" end="03:30:50.319" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="03:30:56.960" end="03:31:00.239" style="s2">no not the dissipation hypothesis no the</p>
<p begin="03:30:58.960" end="03:31:00.880" style="s2">dissipation hypothesis i just think is</p>
<p begin="03:31:00.239" end="03:31:02.880" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="03:31:00.880" end="03:31:05.520" style="s2">um no what&#39;s political is whether you</p>
<p begin="03:31:02.880" end="03:31:08.560" style="s2">believe let&#39;s say masks do nothing</p>
<p begin="03:31:05.520" end="03:31:10.560" style="s2">right should people wear them or not</p>
<p begin="03:31:08.560" end="03:31:11.600" style="s2">wear them</p>
<p begin="03:31:10.560" end="03:31:13.120" style="s2">i mean i think you&#39;d have people who</p>
<p begin="03:31:11.600" end="03:31:13.600" style="s2">still say people should wear them so i</p>
<p begin="03:31:13.120" end="03:31:15.760" style="s2">mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:31:13.600" end="03:31:16.880" style="s2">at that point there&#39;s no science has</p>
<p begin="03:31:15.760" end="03:31:19.760" style="s2">done its part right</p>
<p begin="03:31:16.880" end="03:31:21.760" style="s2">um this is a general thing a general</p>
<p begin="03:31:19.760" end="03:31:26.000" style="s2">thing about rationality</p>
<p begin="03:31:21.760" end="03:31:28.080" style="s2">uh rationality can never</p>
<p begin="03:31:26.000" end="03:31:29.680" style="s2">make policy decisions you cannot use</p>
<p begin="03:31:28.080" end="03:31:32.080" style="s2">science to make policy decisions</p>
<p begin="03:31:29.680" end="03:31:32.960" style="s2">in your personal life you cannot use</p>
<p begin="03:31:32.080" end="03:31:35.200" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="03:31:32.960" end="03:31:36.800" style="s2">to determine what you should do right</p>
<p begin="03:31:35.200" end="03:31:37.760" style="s2">like asking like what i should do with</p>
<p begin="03:31:36.800" end="03:31:39.040" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="03:31:37.760" end="03:31:40.479" style="s2">science can&#39;t answer that question</p>
<p begin="03:31:39.040" end="03:31:41.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s not really a scientific</p>
<p begin="03:31:40.479" end="03:31:44.160" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="03:31:41.760" end="03:31:46.000" style="s2">the only thing science can have the kind</p>
<p begin="03:31:44.160" end="03:31:49.200" style="s2">of question science can answer is</p>
<p begin="03:31:46.000" end="03:31:49.520" style="s2">questions that look like if we do x will</p>
<p begin="03:31:49.200" end="03:31:55.840" style="s2">y</p>
<p begin="03:31:49.520" end="03:31:57.279" style="s2">happen right</p>
<p begin="03:31:55.840" end="03:32:00.000" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s definitely a downside i</p>
<p begin="03:31:57.279" end="03:32:01.520" style="s2">don&#39;t like it right</p>
<p begin="03:32:00.000" end="03:32:03.279" style="s2">there&#39;s no downside to wearing crosses</p>
<p begin="03:32:01.520" end="03:32:04.640" style="s2">either and then any evidence you want to</p>
<p begin="03:32:03.279" end="03:32:07.040" style="s2">give i already made this point</p>
<p begin="03:32:04.640" end="03:32:09.439" style="s2">multiple times on this stream um but</p>
<p begin="03:32:07.040" end="03:32:11.279" style="s2">yeah i mean there is no</p>
<p begin="03:32:09.439" end="03:32:12.560" style="s2">if there&#39;s no downside or no upside</p>
<p begin="03:32:11.279" end="03:32:14.160" style="s2">whether you wear it or not</p>
<p begin="03:32:12.560" end="03:32:15.600" style="s2">you can&#39;t i mean science doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="03:32:14.160" end="03:32:18.160" style="s2">opinion on that</p>
<p begin="03:32:15.600" end="03:32:19.520" style="s2">right even if your goal is to reduce or</p>
<p begin="03:32:18.160" end="03:32:22.720" style="s2">increase the spread of corona</p>
<p begin="03:32:19.520" end="03:32:24.880" style="s2">even if your goal is like like withers</p>
<p begin="03:32:22.720" end="03:32:26.960" style="s2">science can only answer the question</p>
<p begin="03:32:24.880" end="03:32:29.439" style="s2">will widespread use of cloth masks</p>
<p begin="03:32:26.960" end="03:32:30.880" style="s2">reduce the spread of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="03:32:29.439" end="03:32:34.720" style="s2">right even if science answers that</p>
<p begin="03:32:30.880" end="03:32:34.720" style="s2">question as no you know</p>
<p begin="03:32:34.840" end="03:32:38.560" style="s2">right i think filtration studies aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:32:37.359" end="03:32:41.840" style="s2">related yet at all</p>
<p begin="03:32:38.560" end="03:32:43.760" style="s2">with uh our masks i don&#39;t think uh</p>
<p begin="03:32:41.840" end="03:32:45.520" style="s2">filtration studies answer that question</p>
<p begin="03:32:43.760" end="03:32:48.080" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="03:32:45.520" end="03:32:49.520" style="s2">the question will widespread use of</p>
<p begin="03:32:48.080" end="03:32:51.040" style="s2">cloth masks reduce the spread of</p>
<p begin="03:32:49.520" end="03:32:53.040" style="s2">coronifiers that&#39;s the question that</p>
<p begin="03:32:51.040" end="03:33:05.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve never seen a</p>
<p begin="03:32:53.040" end="03:33:05.840" style="s2">definitive answer to</p>
<p begin="03:33:07.840" end="03:33:12.160" style="s2">um the rna based</p>
<p begin="03:33:16.880" end="03:33:24.800" style="s2">rbd binding what&#39;s rbd binding</p>
<p begin="03:33:21.920" end="03:33:24.800" style="s2">what&#39;s rbd</p>

<p begin="03:33:36.720" end="03:33:41.439" style="s2">no science can also it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="03:33:39.840" end="03:33:43.200" style="s2">the interpretation can be done by</p>
<p begin="03:33:41.439" end="03:33:44.560" style="s2">science as well right</p>
<p begin="03:33:43.200" end="03:33:45.680" style="s2">so the measurement is a completely</p>
<p begin="03:33:44.560" end="03:33:47.200" style="s2">separate thing the data gathering</p>
<p begin="03:33:45.680" end="03:33:48.880" style="s2">science can interpret data</p>
<p begin="03:33:47.200" end="03:33:50.720" style="s2">but science can only interpret data to</p>
<p begin="03:33:48.880" end="03:33:52.479" style="s2">answer like like</p>
<p begin="03:33:50.720" end="03:33:53.760" style="s2">questions about what will happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:33:52.479" end="03:34:01.840" style="s2">predictive</p>
<p begin="03:33:53.760" end="03:34:01.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not like generatives</p>
<p begin="03:34:04.319" end="03:34:08.319" style="s2">even if the benefit is small the</p>
<p begin="03:34:06.080" end="03:34:10.000" style="s2">short-term discomfort of wearing a mask</p>
<p begin="03:34:08.319" end="03:34:11.840" style="s2">is worth it to get the whole pandemic</p>
<p begin="03:34:10.000" end="03:34:12.479" style="s2">over with faster what if the benefit is</p>
<p begin="03:34:11.840" end="03:34:15.040" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="03:34:12.479" end="03:34:15.840" style="s2">what if cloth masks actually make more</p>
<p begin="03:34:15.040" end="03:34:19.600" style="s2">people sick</p>
<p begin="03:34:15.840" end="03:34:22.960" style="s2">right which is what this study shows</p>
<p begin="03:34:19.600" end="03:34:25.200" style="s2">see that&#39;s that&#39;s a bad like like</p>
<p begin="03:34:22.960" end="03:34:29.840" style="s2">again does your statement apply to gold</p>
<p begin="03:34:25.200" end="03:34:29.840" style="s2">crosses as well</p>
<p begin="03:34:36.640" end="03:34:41.439" style="s2">well if you want to study about how</p>
<p begin="03:34:39.200" end="03:34:44.319" style="s2">would a cloth mask make someone sick you</p>
<p begin="03:34:41.439" end="03:34:44.319" style="s2">can read the study</p>
<p begin="03:34:46.239" end="03:34:50.239" style="s2">which is the only study of the of the</p>
<p begin="03:34:48.399" end="03:34:57.840" style="s2">mask studies i looked at that talks</p>
<p begin="03:34:50.239" end="03:34:57.840" style="s2">about cloth masks</p>
<p begin="03:35:10.239" end="03:35:15.439" style="s2">you know honestly oh this has been a</p>

<p begin="03:35:15.439" end="03:35:20.960" style="s2">just recent recent stuff has just made</p>
<p begin="03:35:17.760" end="03:35:24.319" style="s2">me feel so hopeless for humanity man</p>
<p begin="03:35:20.960" end="03:35:26.239" style="s2">you know here we are we develop all of</p>
<p begin="03:35:24.319" end="03:35:29.279" style="s2">this really nice stuff you know we</p>
<p begin="03:35:26.239" end="03:35:31.760" style="s2">develop all of these beautiful</p>
<p begin="03:35:29.279" end="03:35:34.880" style="s2">scientific machineries math that i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:35:31.760" end="03:35:37.600" style="s2">even begin to comprehend</p>
<p begin="03:35:34.880" end="03:35:40.560" style="s2">and like you know we have we have</p>

<p begin="03:35:40.560" end="03:35:44.800" style="s2">i mean those are that&#39;s an easy target</p>
<p begin="03:35:42.080" end="03:35:46.800" style="s2">to rip on and it&#39;s fairly apolitical</p>
<p begin="03:35:44.800" end="03:35:48.160" style="s2">um but there&#39;s a whole lot of political</p>
<p begin="03:35:46.800" end="03:35:50.080" style="s2">ones you could rip on as well where</p>

<p begin="03:35:57.200" end="03:36:03.359" style="s2">um so i mean i you know</p>
<p begin="03:36:00.960" end="03:36:04.560" style="s2">again my skin in the game here is that i</p>
<p begin="03:36:03.359" end="03:36:07.600" style="s2">want to live forever</p>
<p begin="03:36:04.560" end="03:36:11.120" style="s2">and if we live in a society that starts</p>
<p begin="03:36:07.600" end="03:36:13.359" style="s2">uh deciding science is stupid</p>
<p begin="03:36:11.120" end="03:36:14.800" style="s2">and then you know well that&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="03:36:13.359" end="03:36:17.439" style="s2">me living forever because let me tell</p>
<p begin="03:36:14.800" end="03:36:21.840" style="s2">you about gold crosses and masks</p>
<p begin="03:36:17.439" end="03:36:23.120" style="s2">sure won&#39;t make you live forever</p>
<p begin="03:36:21.840" end="03:36:25.120" style="s2">kind of makes you wonder what the point</p>
<p begin="03:36:23.120" end="03:36:26.239" style="s2">of progress is one day i&#39;m gonna live in</p>
<p begin="03:36:25.120" end="03:36:30.319" style="s2">a spaceship</p>
<p begin="03:36:26.239" end="03:36:30.319" style="s2">man i&#39;m gonna live in a spaceship</p>
<p begin="03:36:31.680" end="03:36:36.960" style="s2">oh let&#39;s talk stargate</p>
<p begin="03:36:38.399" end="03:36:41.439" style="s2">has it gotten better or worse over time</p>
<p begin="03:36:40.160" end="03:36:42.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stupid people in the</p>
<p begin="03:36:41.439" end="03:36:44.399" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="03:36:42.080" end="03:36:46.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean that might be an</p>
<p begin="03:36:44.399" end="03:36:48.160" style="s2">interesting thing to explore in a stream</p>
<p begin="03:36:46.840" end="03:36:50.720" style="s2">sometime</p>
<p begin="03:36:48.160" end="03:36:52.880" style="s2">the flynn effect has largely stopped um</p>
<p begin="03:36:50.720" end="03:36:54.880" style="s2">and the world is more complicated now</p>
<p begin="03:36:52.880" end="03:36:58.640" style="s2">than it ever was so it may not be</p>
<p begin="03:36:54.880" end="03:37:00.960" style="s2">that even if people are getting smarter</p>
<p begin="03:36:58.640" end="03:37:03.040" style="s2">if the world&#39;s getting more complex at a</p>
<p begin="03:37:00.960" end="03:37:05.359" style="s2">faster rate</p>
<p begin="03:37:03.040" end="03:37:06.800" style="s2">like when you lived in the world when</p>
<p begin="03:37:05.359" end="03:37:10.000" style="s2">you lived in like the forest</p>
<p begin="03:37:06.800" end="03:37:15.200" style="s2">like there wasn&#39;t much</p>
<p begin="03:37:10.000" end="03:37:18.239" style="s2">uh common sense worked really well</p>
<p begin="03:37:15.200" end="03:37:20.000" style="s2">in today&#39;s world common sense may not</p>
<p begin="03:37:18.239" end="03:37:21.279" style="s2">work so well anymore and we may have to</p>
<p begin="03:37:20.000" end="03:37:24.000" style="s2">use science so we may have to use</p>
<p begin="03:37:21.279" end="03:37:24.000" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="03:37:24.960" end="03:37:28.880" style="s2">um one of the judge dread comments</p>
<p begin="03:37:27.439" end="03:37:30.080" style="s2">people can afford to be stupid i mean</p>
<p begin="03:37:28.880" end="03:37:33.359" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing too</p>
<p begin="03:37:30.080" end="03:37:34.800" style="s2">right like if you have um if people are</p>
<p begin="03:37:33.359" end="03:37:39.040" style="s2">being supported</p>
<p begin="03:37:34.800" end="03:37:41.040" style="s2">uh you know by</p>
<p begin="03:37:39.040" end="03:37:43.120" style="s2">the the baseline for whether people</p>
<p begin="03:37:41.040" end="03:37:44.000" style="s2">could survive in the past was like did</p>
<p begin="03:37:43.120" end="03:37:47.439" style="s2">they understand</p>
<p begin="03:37:44.000" end="03:37:48.239" style="s2">how to like hunt and eat and then grow</p>
<p begin="03:37:47.439" end="03:37:50.479" style="s2">food and do</p>
<p begin="03:37:48.239" end="03:37:52.080" style="s2">like practical things today what does it</p>
<p begin="03:37:50.479" end="03:37:54.319" style="s2">take to survive</p>
<p begin="03:37:52.080" end="03:37:55.359" style="s2">well you know you got to convince other</p>
<p begin="03:37:54.319" end="03:37:56.800" style="s2">people to like</p>
<p begin="03:37:55.359" end="03:37:59.600" style="s2">give you basically i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:37:56.800" end="03:38:01.920" style="s2">the economy um and it turns out you can</p>
<p begin="03:37:59.600" end="03:38:05.359" style="s2">get big clusters of people</p>
<p begin="03:38:01.920" end="03:38:06.720" style="s2">who like uh this is that</p>
<p begin="03:38:05.359" end="03:38:08.479" style="s2">this is an interesting thing to go into</p>
<p begin="03:38:06.720" end="03:38:11.840" style="s2">too like where does where does uh</p>
<p begin="03:38:08.479" end="03:38:12.160" style="s2">where does wealth actually come from um</p>
<p begin="03:38:11.840" end="03:38:13.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="03:38:12.160" end="03:38:15.680" style="s2">i might take always on it as like you</p>
<p begin="03:38:13.840" end="03:38:18.000" style="s2">have people like baristas and</p>
<p begin="03:38:15.680" end="03:38:19.359" style="s2">shoeshiners who don&#39;t create any value</p>
<p begin="03:38:18.000" end="03:38:20.399" style="s2">um they don&#39;t i mean i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="03:38:19.359" end="03:38:21.600" style="s2">they&#39;re useless but they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="03:38:20.399" end="03:38:23.840" style="s2">create any value you can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="03:38:21.600" end="03:38:25.200" style="s2">economy full of baristas and shoeshiners</p>
<p begin="03:38:23.840" end="03:38:27.040" style="s2">and then you have people like farmers</p>
<p begin="03:38:25.200" end="03:38:29.359" style="s2">and miners who create linear value</p>
<p begin="03:38:27.040" end="03:38:31.359" style="s2">right like like for every uh for every</p>
<p begin="03:38:29.359" end="03:38:33.520" style="s2">acre of land you cultivate</p>
<p begin="03:38:31.359" end="03:38:35.279" style="s2">you get it&#39;s linear right for every ton</p>
<p begin="03:38:33.520" end="03:38:37.120" style="s2">of ore you mine it&#39;s linear</p>
<p begin="03:38:35.279" end="03:38:39.279" style="s2">um and then there are these these these</p>
<p begin="03:38:37.120" end="03:38:40.880" style="s2">uh like like squared effect people</p>
<p begin="03:38:39.279" end="03:38:42.239" style="s2">who build technology right if you build</p>
<p begin="03:38:40.880" end="03:38:43.120" style="s2">technology if you build a washing</p>
<p begin="03:38:42.239" end="03:38:46.080" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="03:38:43.120" end="03:38:47.439" style="s2">that if you build a washing machine that</p>
<p begin="03:38:46.080" end="03:38:49.439" style="s2">automatically washes the clothes that</p>
<p begin="03:38:47.439" end="03:38:51.920" style="s2">now takes five minutes of human labor</p>
<p begin="03:38:49.439" end="03:38:53.520" style="s2">versus three hours of human labor you</p>
<p begin="03:38:51.920" end="03:38:54.800" style="s2">freed up all of this time and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:38:53.520" end="03:38:56.239" style="s2">making things more efficient but you</p>
<p begin="03:38:54.800" end="03:38:58.000" style="s2">can&#39;t entirely have that</p>
<p begin="03:38:56.239" end="03:38:59.279" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have the linear base if you</p>
<p begin="03:38:58.000" end="03:39:02.720" style="s2">have nothing that you&#39;re making more</p>
<p begin="03:38:59.279" end="03:39:02.720" style="s2">efficient it doesn&#39;t help you at all</p>
<p begin="03:39:04.319" end="03:39:08.880" style="s2">mimetics and genetics are now forever</p>
<p begin="03:39:06.800" end="03:39:12.000" style="s2">intertwined medic fitness is not</p>
<p begin="03:39:08.880" end="03:39:12.000" style="s2">necessarily ideal</p>
<p begin="03:39:16.560" end="03:39:23.199" style="s2">um it is so</p>
<p begin="03:39:19.920" end="03:39:24.880" style="s2">my hypothesis on college is</p>
<p begin="03:39:23.199" end="03:39:26.880" style="s2">it teaches to the level of the average</p>
<p begin="03:39:24.880" end="03:39:28.479" style="s2">you can&#39;t put sixty percent of the</p>
<p begin="03:39:26.880" end="03:39:30.560" style="s2">population through college</p>
<p begin="03:39:28.479" end="03:39:31.920" style="s2">what you get is a dumbing down of</p>
<p begin="03:39:30.560" end="03:39:34.399" style="s2">college right</p>
<p begin="03:39:31.920" end="03:39:37.040" style="s2">the sixth the bell curve applies no</p>
<p begin="03:39:34.399" end="03:39:38.800" style="s2">matter what the bell curve will always</p>
<p begin="03:39:37.040" end="03:39:42.239" style="s2">apply to any population</p>
<p begin="03:39:38.800" end="03:39:43.680" style="s2">right um so if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="03:39:42.239" end="03:39:45.279" style="s2">increased the number of people who go to</p>
<p begin="03:39:43.680" end="03:39:46.960" style="s2">college i don&#39;t think you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="03:39:45.279" end="03:39:51.840" style="s2">everybody smarter i think you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="03:39:46.960" end="03:39:51.840" style="s2">college dumber</p>
<p begin="03:39:54.239" end="03:40:00.000" style="s2">um but yeah all right that&#39;s my end of</p>
