<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">click the top one</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">right so compare the look of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">website on the left</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">to the look of the website on the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">i don&#39;t want websites that look like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">one on the left i want websites that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">look like the one on the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">almost look at this one yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">if a website has um</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">like tweet save i don&#39;t want it right</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">how is it then in the age of beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">google&#39;s top results are this trash</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">um now there&#39;s three hypotheses for this</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">that i come up with quickly i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">uh one is this is what people actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">want um and i&#39;m most inclined to believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">because you know it just just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">that&#39;s like occam&#39;s razor</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">it turns out people actually want things</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">full of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">spammy ads and up see i scroll down well</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">look there&#39;s a pop-up wow am i surprised</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">no you know what i&#39;d be surprised if i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">scrolled down on here and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">pop-up</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">i recommend using thetradeschools.net</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">because you can find the program that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">nearby or online right um</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">so hypothesis number two</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">is that google is somehow uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">making money off of this somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">this website</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">is leading people back to google or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">maximizing some metric that google cares</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">at the expense of its users</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">hypothesis three is that google cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">right and like look at these two</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">um let&#39;s so we have cora</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">um cora is it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">how korra does this i will never sign up</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">for a core account</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">never korra would keep me on their</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">website so much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t do this crap but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">continue to and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">that&#39;s a question for cora um</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">hypothesis number one is that uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">actually what people want</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">right uh let&#39;s see this one</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">this is better slightly better</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">um this is the kind of person who maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">today is like a digital nomad you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">digital nomadism is a ponzi scheme</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">it&#39;s not what people want well so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">talk about the definition of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">certainly not what i want and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">probably not what you want fellow people</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">in chat</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">um so let&#39;s see this one</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">what the intention of the creator of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">website is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">okay if the intention of the creator of</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">business model so the intention of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">creating that content is to feed the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">business model</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">a general correlation but we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">immediately rule out any website with</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">javascript right</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">what i really want to get at is what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">the intention of the creator of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">if the intention of the creator of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">and the only reason this this web page</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">was created was to increase the size of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">their funnel</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;m out so we can we can rule that out</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad website</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">um another example of a bad website so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s less clear exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">call to action is here</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">um well actually no we have the call to</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">you can tell a lot about a website just</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">by looking at its call to action</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">so this guy is trying to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">sign up for his newsletter</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">use and kind of like an adverse metric</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">to judge this is how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">time was put into the content creation</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">right can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">i mean one way to do it would be it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">stores</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">level 10 right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">only after 10 people have downloaded</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">you can set your anonymization level</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">like it saves all your websites and as</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">soon as you&#39;ve hit</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">duplication across x number of users it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">then contributes that to the database</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s how anonymized you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">you could open source the search engine</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">but whatever your indexer is going to</p>

<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:16.800" style="s2">this this point um</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.040" end="01:23:20.480" style="s2">turned me off to the unabomber&#39;s hall</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:24.400" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.480" end="01:23:26.960" style="s2">to to industrial society would society</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.400" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">eventually develop again towards an</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.960" end="01:23:31.920" style="s2">industrial technological form</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">he says maybe i think strongly but but</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.920" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">then his next thing is like but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:37.440" style="s2">no use in worrying about it since we</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">can&#39;t predict or control events 500 or a</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.440" end="01:23:40.159" style="s2">thousand years in the future</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:42.239" style="s2">the problems must be dealt with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.159" end="01:23:44.800" style="s2">people who live at them at the time</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.239" end="01:23:45.760" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s the ultimate cop-out right</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.800" end="01:23:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.760" end="01:23:54.480" style="s2">saying um you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.400" end="01:23:56.719" style="s2">what should we do about uh ammo</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.480" end="01:23:59.120" style="s2">here i have a concrete example about</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.719" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.120" end="01:24:02.239" style="s2">we have some people in the world uh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:05.360" style="s2">not gonna uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.239" end="01:24:06.960" style="s2">you know who think amazon is bad</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.360" end="01:24:08.480" style="s2">amazon is destroying local businesses</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.960" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">right there&#39;s a movement against amazon</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.480" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">it&#39;s destroying local businesses shop</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:12.000" style="s2">local</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">shut down amazon right these people</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.000" end="01:24:14.719" style="s2">think that shutting down amazon is going</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:17.120" style="s2">to do something</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.719" end="01:24:18.719" style="s2">um and you could shut down amazon you</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.120" end="01:24:20.560" style="s2">could actually technically do this you</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.719" end="01:24:22.320" style="s2">you acquire enough guns and force you</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.560" end="01:24:24.639" style="s2">can you could shut down amazon but</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.320" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">amazon will subtly pop up in many</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.639" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">different forms right they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:29.440" style="s2">to be called</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">amazon you know but like you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.440" end="01:24:33.280" style="s2">you can use your guns to stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">amazon as well but this centralization</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.280" end="01:24:37.040" style="s2">of supply chains</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">and the centralization of of you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.040" end="01:24:41.440" style="s2">that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:43.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t stop the idea right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.440" end="01:24:45.120" style="s2">precursors that led to it</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.440" end="01:24:47.120" style="s2">if you kill newton you don&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.120" end="01:24:48.560" style="s2">calculus leibniz invents it if you kill</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.120" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">newton and leibniz</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.560" end="01:24:54.159" style="s2">you still get calculus right which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">let&#39;s see yeah i want to stop calculus</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.159" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">right so i&#39;m going to get a time machine</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.560" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to kill newton and leibniz</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">when they&#39;re babies right</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.639" end="01:25:03.840" style="s2">um would society eventually develop</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:05.520" style="s2">calculus</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.840" end="01:25:06.880" style="s2">maybe but there&#39;s no use in worrying</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.520" end="01:25:08.960" style="s2">about it since we can&#39;t predict or</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.880" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">control the events now that luke newton</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.960" end="01:25:11.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:12.400" style="s2">uh livenets are dead these problems must</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.280" end="01:25:13.040" style="s2">be dealt with people with people who are</p>

<p begin="01:25:17.440" end="01:25:22.159" style="s2">were you a team all maximalist</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:23.840" style="s2">centralization is just part of society i</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.159" end="01:25:27.360" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s true i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.840" end="01:25:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s true i think that there are</p>

<p begin="01:25:34.000" end="01:25:41.600" style="s2">um we&#39;re stressed</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.400" end="01:25:43.840" style="s2">cantor well we&#39;d never have</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.600" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">diagonalization we&#39;d finally do away</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.840" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">finitism could finally be accepted in</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:49.199" style="s2">mathematics we could all accept that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.600" end="01:25:50.960" style="s2">integers and the reals really do have</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.199" end="01:25:52.159" style="s2">the same cardinality and cantor let us</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.960" end="01:25:54.159" style="s2">down a terrible path</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.159" end="01:25:56.159" style="s2">for the last 120 years all right i&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.159" end="01:25:57.440" style="s2">on board as soon as someone gets a time</p>

<p begin="01:25:59.600" end="01:26:05.520" style="s2">you know what else did cantor want to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.000" end="01:26:05.520" style="s2">with his life go to art school man</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.840" end="01:26:09.840" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">computable numbers exist right</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.840" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">so like pi obviously exists because</p>

<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:54.320" style="s2">at least as far as writing a number down</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.320" end="01:27:55.840" style="s2">obviously ultra finitism is true but as</p>

<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:03.840" style="s2">um right but if the universe is finite</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.400" end="01:28:05.440" style="s2">you know you can only write down what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:28:28.239" end="01:28:31.600" style="s2">is this is a math problem that is</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.760" end="01:28:34.159" style="s2">actually within</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.600" end="01:28:36.639" style="s2">uh probably within my reach if i spent</p>

<p begin="01:41:18.719" end="01:41:22.560" style="s2">a lot of times i just sit and like i use</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.880" end="01:41:24.239" style="s2">the tools of programming to think about</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.560" end="01:41:26.320" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.239" end="01:41:28.239" style="s2">right obviously if i was trying to build</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.320" end="01:41:28.800" style="s2">a very concrete chrome extension to do</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.239" end="01:41:30.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.800" end="01:41:32.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen me like when you saw watch</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.480" end="01:41:34.159" style="s2">the stream where i make voice app right</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.400" end="01:41:35.520" style="s2">i made i had something very clear that i</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.159" end="01:41:36.480" style="s2">wanted to do and i got it done in 30</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.520" end="01:41:38.080" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.480" end="01:41:39.360" style="s2">the thing is i&#39;m not exactly sure what i</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.080" end="01:41:40.080" style="s2">want to build with the chrome extension</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.360" end="01:41:41.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.080" end="01:41:43.600" style="s2">so i can build something that sniffs all</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.760" end="01:41:45.760" style="s2">traffic um</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.600" end="01:41:46.639" style="s2">but i don&#39;t even really need a chrome</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.760" end="01:41:50.239" style="s2">extension</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.639" end="01:41:51.199" style="s2">for this right like i could do this with</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.239" end="01:41:53.600" style="s2">like or like</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.199" end="01:41:55.199" style="s2">like a root kit kind of thing right i</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.600" end="01:41:58.239" style="s2">could do this with just something that</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.199" end="01:42:00.159" style="s2">sniffs all the internet traffic when</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.239" end="01:42:03.600" style="s2">chrome does https</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.159" end="01:42:06.560" style="s2">is that in the chrome process</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.600" end="01:42:09.199" style="s2">i guess it has to be but it&#39;s linking to</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.560" end="01:42:11.280" style="s2">stuff like live ssl</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.199" end="01:42:13.119" style="s2">right so i mean the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.280" end="01:42:14.800" style="s2">might actually be to do like an ld</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.119" end="01:42:17.280" style="s2">preload like thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.800" end="01:42:18.639" style="s2">right if i ld preload and i just</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.280" end="01:42:21.760" style="s2">intercept all of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.639" end="01:42:24.960" style="s2">uh all the calls to connect</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.760" end="01:42:26.480" style="s2">right i do it at a syscall level no but</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.960" end="01:42:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s also not gonna i can&#39;t do it at a</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.480" end="01:42:31.360" style="s2">cis call level because that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.000" end="01:42:31.360" style="s2">to get me around https</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.159" end="01:42:36.400" style="s2">all right and then the other problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.880" end="01:42:39.600" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.400" end="01:42:42.320" style="s2">is you kind of want both right</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.600" end="01:42:43.600" style="s2">you kind of want both there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.320" end="01:42:44.239" style="s2">information that you get from the</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.600" end="01:42:45.520" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.239" end="01:42:49.199" style="s2">and there&#39;s some information that you</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.520" end="01:42:49.199" style="s2">get from the uh from the text</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.280" end="01:42:52.320" style="s2">i would actually say there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.320" end="01:42:54.800" style="s2">information you get from the picture the</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.320" end="01:42:56.080" style="s2">live stream is better</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.800" end="01:42:57.840" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t want a chrome extension i</p>

<p begin="02:09:16.000" end="02:09:19.840" style="s2">uh and then the students who score in</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.760" end="02:09:21.440" style="s2">the top point one percent of it</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.840" end="02:09:23.280" style="s2">like go to like chinguan university or</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.440" end="02:09:26.880" style="s2">something like the top university there</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.280" end="02:09:28.960" style="s2">um the problem is the top</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.880" end="02:09:31.440" style="s2">taking from the randomly sampling from</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.960" end="02:09:33.920" style="s2">the top five percent of test takers</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.440" end="02:09:35.280" style="s2">is probably better at achieving almost</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.920" end="02:09:38.719" style="s2">any desired outcome</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.280" end="02:09:40.400" style="s2">than taking the top point one</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.719" end="02:09:41.760" style="s2">because you get weird people who are</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.400" end="02:09:44.000" style="s2">frequently good at tests and not much</p>

<p begin="02:10:59.920" end="02:11:03.920" style="s2">few things</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.880" end="02:11:07.199" style="s2">uh admissions is uh just an iq test</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.920" end="02:11:08.320" style="s2">um and everybody who has uh does uh 130</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.199" end="02:11:12.800" style="s2">or better can</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.320" end="02:11:15.199" style="s2">can come um and freshman year is free</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.800" end="02:11:16.079" style="s2">uh so like here might hear my thoughts</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.199" end="02:11:18.000" style="s2">uh yeah</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.079" end="02:11:19.520" style="s2">above 130 on an iq test and freshman</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.000" end="02:11:23.119" style="s2">year is free</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.520" end="02:11:24.800" style="s2">and then at every like</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.119" end="02:11:26.960" style="s2">after the semester you have your final</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.800" end="02:11:28.800" style="s2">exams and</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.960" end="02:11:30.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a hard cut off it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.800" end="02:11:32.560" style="s2">nothing&#39;s curved but there&#39;s a hard cut</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.719" end="02:11:33.040" style="s2">off and everybody below the hard cut off</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.560" end="02:11:35.199" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.040" end="02:11:36.239" style="s2">is kicked out um they fail and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.199" end="02:11:39.599" style="s2">kicked out</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.239" end="02:11:40.639" style="s2">uh yeah and then for sophomore junior</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.599" end="02:11:42.480" style="s2">and senior year</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.639" end="02:11:44.480" style="s2">i&#39;d like to charge what you could</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.480" end="02:11:45.360" style="s2">comfortably make in a tech internship in</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.480" end="02:11:49.119" style="s2">a summer</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.360" end="02:11:49.119" style="s2">so something like 15 grand a year</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.360" end="02:11:53.360" style="s2">students are not required to use vm no</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.040" end="02:12:06.639" style="s2">and you know with respect to the sat</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.800" end="02:12:08.719" style="s2">correlates with iq very well</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.639" end="02:12:09.840" style="s2">yeah so yeah i mean i think that one of</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.719" end="02:12:11.360" style="s2">the things we could do i mean i&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.840" end="02:12:13.280" style="s2">to make a research university and i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.360" end="02:12:15.040" style="s2">want to do a lot of research into</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.280" end="02:12:16.639" style="s2">uh intelligence tests and what</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.040" end="02:12:18.079" style="s2">intelligence is i&#39;m very interested in</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.639" end="02:12:20.880" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.079" end="02:12:22.079" style="s2">um not just human intelligence but</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.880" end="02:12:24.000" style="s2">machine intelligence all</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.079" end="02:12:27.360" style="s2">kinds machine intelligence systemic</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.000" end="02:12:30.480" style="s2">intelligence corporate intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.360" end="02:12:32.079" style="s2">intelligence services um</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.480" end="02:12:34.880" style="s2">this is another another startup idea</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.079" end="02:12:37.920" style="s2">that we talk about sometimes is um</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.880" end="02:12:39.520" style="s2">making a a private nsa</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.920" end="02:12:41.040" style="s2">like uh as a parent here kind of but</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.520" end="02:12:42.239" style="s2">what if we made like penalty for people</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.040" end="02:12:43.920" style="s2">like what if you made a private</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.239" end="02:12:46.239" style="s2">investigation company but like really</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.920" end="02:12:46.239" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.840" end="02:12:51.360" style="s2">um 130</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.520" end="02:12:53.119" style="s2">you could say 130 is low and we would</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.360" end="02:12:56.000" style="s2">see i mean we&#39;d see as this grows</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.119" end="02:12:57.840" style="s2">we might have to introduce other uh</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.000" end="02:13:00.800" style="s2">objective criteria</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.840" end="02:13:02.079" style="s2">in the cutoff um let&#39;s let&#39;s google</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.800" end="02:13:03.440" style="s2">something i don&#39;t want to say this if it</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.079" end="02:13:08.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.440" end="02:13:17.840" style="s2">um but how mit</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.400" end="02:13:17.840" style="s2">uh rose to prominence</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.719" end="02:13:24.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.480" end="02:13:29.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this is hard to find but</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.239" end="02:13:31.280" style="s2">what i&#39;ll say is the the theory that</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.760" end="02:13:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard about mit&#39;s rise to</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.280" end="02:13:34.800" style="s2">prominence</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.000" end="02:13:35.840" style="s2">is a harvard discriminated in ways mit</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.800" end="02:13:38.159" style="s2">did not</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.840" end="02:13:39.679" style="s2">um and i think today&#39;s universities are</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.159" end="02:13:41.599" style="s2">discriminating</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.679" end="02:13:42.880" style="s2">uh like they discriminate based on i</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.599" end="02:13:44.400" style="s2">mean now they&#39;re throwing the sat out</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.880" end="02:13:45.920" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.400" end="02:13:49.040" style="s2">where the s.a.t you at least have some</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.920" end="02:13:51.760" style="s2">objective standard um now it&#39;s entirely</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.040" end="02:13:53.199" style="s2">nepotistic bullshit right or oh how do</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.760" end="02:13:55.199" style="s2">you write on an essay oh we want</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.199" end="02:13:57.440" style="s2">well-rounded students right all this</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.199" end="02:13:59.119" style="s2">stuff is completely so the</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.440" end="02:14:00.480" style="s2">admissions people can use whatever</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.119" end="02:14:01.599" style="s2">subjective criteria they want right</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.480" end="02:14:03.040" style="s2">there are no more</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.599" end="02:14:04.320" style="s2">they want to do away with the last bit</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.040" end="02:14:06.800" style="s2">of objective criteria in college</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.320" end="02:14:09.119" style="s2">admissions</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.800" end="02:14:09.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.480" end="02:14:14.719" style="s2">with regard to iq is a really bad</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.960" end="02:14:19.520" style="s2">indicator of intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.719" end="02:14:22.880" style="s2">uh all right</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.520" end="02:14:28.079" style="s2">this was posted mainstream</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.880" end="02:14:29.440" style="s2">uh science on race and intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.079" end="02:14:31.679" style="s2">i don&#39;t agree with everything in this</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.440" end="02:14:34.960" style="s2">document but</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.679" end="02:14:40.000" style="s2">this was posted signed by</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.960" end="02:14:42.719" style="s2">uh 52 university professors in 1994</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.000" end="02:14:43.360" style="s2">and we won&#39;t talk about the race ones</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.719" end="02:14:45.119" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.360" end="02:14:47.440" style="s2">um intelligence is a very general mental</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.119" end="02:14:49.119" style="s2">capability uh it reflects a broader and</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.440" end="02:14:50.000" style="s2">deeper capability for comprehending our</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.119" end="02:14:51.920" style="s2">surroundings</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.000" end="02:14:53.920" style="s2">intelligence so defined can be measured</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.920" end="02:14:55.840" style="s2">and iq tests measure it well</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.920" end="02:14:58.159" style="s2">intelligence tests measure well they are</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.840" end="02:15:00.719" style="s2">among the most accurate</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.159" end="02:15:02.320" style="s2">in technical terms reliable and valid of</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.719" end="02:15:05.199" style="s2">all psychological tests and</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.320" end="02:15:07.119" style="s2">assessment um well there are different</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.199" end="02:15:10.320" style="s2">types of intelligence tests</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.119" end="02:15:13.280" style="s2">they all measure the same intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.320" end="02:15:13.679" style="s2">so like you say iq tests are bad tests</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.280" end="02:15:15.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.679" end="02:15:17.440" style="s2">intelligence i mean you can define</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.599" end="02:15:19.199" style="s2">intelligence to mean whatever you want</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.440" end="02:15:23.360" style="s2">if you define intelligence to mean piano</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.199" end="02:15:25.599" style="s2">playing skills and that&#39;s probably true</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.360" end="02:15:27.440" style="s2">but iq is strongly related probably more</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.599" end="02:15:28.239" style="s2">so than any other single measurable</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.440" end="02:15:29.920" style="s2">human trait</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.239" end="02:15:31.360" style="s2">to many important educational</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.920" end="02:15:33.360" style="s2">occupational</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.360" end="02:15:35.040" style="s2">uh economic and social outcomes whatever</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.360" end="02:15:37.840" style="s2">iq tests measure it&#39;s a great practical</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.040" end="02:15:37.840" style="s2">and social importance</p>

<p begin="02:18:56.880" end="02:19:07.840" style="s2">kind of biased topic right</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.040" end="02:19:07.840" style="s2">iq correlates</p>

<p begin="02:20:06.960" end="02:20:11.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a topic i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.319" end="02:20:12.800" style="s2">heard also about like fluidic</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.840" end="02:20:17.840" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.800" end="02:20:17.840" style="s2">and crystalline intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.600" end="02:20:31.840" style="s2">and if you think about like iq measures</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.920" end="02:20:31.840" style="s2">uh fluidic intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.240" end="02:20:46.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a sad truth too</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.720" end="02:20:48.560" style="s2">fluid intelligence peaks at around age</p>
<p begin="02:20:46.640" end="02:20:50.080" style="s2">20 i mean this is this has been</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.560" end="02:20:52.000" style="s2">this has been a thing in my life like i</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.080" end="02:20:55.439" style="s2">could remember</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.000" end="02:20:56.960" style="s2">um getting better at things and not just</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.439" end="02:20:58.960" style="s2">at specific tasks</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.960" end="02:21:01.280" style="s2">but getting better at getting better at</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.960" end="02:21:04.080" style="s2">things and this has stopped</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.280" end="02:21:06.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s a sad i mean it&#39;s just a sad</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.080" end="02:21:06.720" style="s2">thing in life</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.760" end="02:21:13.840" style="s2">the validity of iq is pretty good at</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.000" end="02:21:13.840" style="s2">least according to my professors</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.760" end="02:21:20.160" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s possible right so you you if</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.479" end="02:21:22.800" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.160" end="02:21:23.760" style="s2">view if you&#39;re communist you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.800" end="02:21:27.439" style="s2">something like iq</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.760" end="02:21:31.520" style="s2">right um because well you know</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.439" end="02:21:35.200" style="s2">iq goes against equality right</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.520" end="02:21:38.800" style="s2">um especially if it correlates with</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.200" end="02:21:40.800" style="s2">let&#39;s scott alexander</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.800" end="02:21:42.240" style="s2">i think in his he had a post about it</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.800" end="02:21:43.120" style="s2">where he said basically it correlates</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.240" end="02:21:44.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.120" end="02:21:46.880" style="s2">almost everything people would consider</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.720" end="02:21:55.840" style="s2">a positive trait except</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.880" end="02:21:55.840" style="s2">for uh likely to reproduce</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.640" end="02:22:23.120" style="s2">well so okay i mean let&#39;s let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.600" end="02:22:24.160" style="s2">that there is some test you can give and</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.120" end="02:22:25.680" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.160" end="02:22:28.160" style="s2">you&#39;re right like let&#39;s think about what</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.680" end="02:22:30.319" style="s2">i would actually want maybe i&#39;m naive to</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.160" end="02:22:33.359" style="s2">think that it&#39;s as simple as an iq test</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.319" end="02:22:34.160" style="s2">all i know is that an iq test is a whole</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.359" end="02:22:37.520" style="s2">lot more</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.160" end="02:22:40.720" style="s2">fair than</p>
<p begin="02:22:37.520" end="02:22:42.160" style="s2">a legacy than saying you can go here</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.720" end="02:22:46.000" style="s2">because your father went here because</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.160" end="02:22:46.000" style="s2">your grandfather went here or crap like</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.840" end="02:22:51.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.760" end="02:23:05.840" style="s2">well the problem with a math test is</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.080" end="02:23:07.439" style="s2">you&#39;re testing for whether somebody</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.840" end="02:23:09.359" style="s2">learned math what you really want to</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.439" end="02:23:10.000" style="s2">test for is somebody&#39;s capability to</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.359" end="02:23:12.560" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.000" end="02:23:14.560" style="s2">right um i mean one way to do this may</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.560" end="02:23:16.560" style="s2">be to make a game</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.560" end="02:23:18.560" style="s2">like if you make a game up where maybe</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.560" end="02:23:21.520" style="s2">this is better</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.560" end="02:23:22.880" style="s2">if you make a game up where there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.520" end="02:23:26.640" style="s2">movie the wizard</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.880" end="02:23:30.160" style="s2">where the last scene people play uh</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.640" end="02:23:31.600" style="s2">super mario 3 and</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.160" end="02:23:46.080" style="s2">i mean the movie is just pretty much a</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.600" end="02:24:01.040" style="s2">scam to introduce super mario 3.</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.080" end="02:24:15.840" style="s2">sat does correlate sat iq correlation</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.040" end="02:24:15.840" style="s2">see if we can find paper</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.720" end="02:25:18.880" style="s2">uh you know what i realized that like</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.120" end="02:25:18.880" style="s2">you can&#39;t have this conversation</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.840" end="02:25:25.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.240" end="02:25:26.960" style="s2">yeah you know you shouldn&#39;t yeah i</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.920" end="02:25:28.640" style="s2">honestly you know i shouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.960" end="02:25:31.520" style="s2">brought this stuff up right</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.640" end="02:25:31.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.880" end="02:25:38.160" style="s2">i mean maybe this is a big problem like</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.840" end="02:25:39.920" style="s2">in society with this stuff in general</p>
<p begin="02:25:38.160" end="02:25:42.240" style="s2">you develop stuff that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.920" end="02:25:45.840" style="s2">proxies for iq tests because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.240" end="02:25:45.840" style="s2">want to use iq tests directly</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.359" end="02:25:50.560" style="s2">but i mean this is my theory about the</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.960" end="02:25:53.520" style="s2">internet and overall internet decline</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.560" end="02:25:56.319" style="s2">right as something becomes easier to use</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.520" end="02:25:57.040" style="s2">like if you have the internet in a way</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.319" end="02:25:59.520" style="s2">used to have</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.040" end="02:26:01.600" style="s2">an intelligence barrier maybe not just</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.520" end="02:26:07.520" style="s2">an intelligence barrier but a</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.600" end="02:26:09.359" style="s2">like motivational barrier to get onto it</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.520" end="02:26:11.439" style="s2">think about how you use your voice yeah</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.359" end="02:26:13.680" style="s2">fuck off that shit</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.439" end="02:26:14.880" style="s2">um no i hate those people i hate those</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.680" end="02:26:15.840" style="s2">think about how you use your voice</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.880" end="02:26:18.640" style="s2">people right</p>

<p begin="02:26:18.640" end="02:26:22.359" style="s2">going to repent for the truth</p>
<p begin="02:26:20.640" end="02:26:24.160" style="s2">when they come and they put me in the</p>

<p begin="02:26:28.479" end="02:26:32.399" style="s2">if if they like started torturing me</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.479" end="02:26:33.760" style="s2">maybe i&#39;d repent</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.399" end="02:26:49.840" style="s2">but you know you&#39;d have to physically</p>

<p begin="02:26:58.640" end="02:27:03.359" style="s2">reddit&#39;s not anymore so what okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.920" end="02:27:05.600" style="s2">think about something more constructive</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.359" end="02:27:05.600" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="02:27:13.040" end="02:27:17.840" style="s2">uses this thing called navboost</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.439" end="02:27:46.960" style="s2">and part of the problem with things that</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.800" end="02:27:46.960" style="s2">look like this is like</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.760" end="02:27:58.479" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to downvote right not</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.960" end="02:28:00.399" style="s2">clicking on a link</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.479" end="02:28:02.000" style="s2">is nowhere near as strong as a down vote</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.399" end="02:28:05.359" style="s2">is saying like there&#39;s no way to say</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.000" end="02:28:06.880" style="s2">this link is bad right um say for</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.359" end="02:28:10.000" style="s2">example you do a google search where</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.880" end="02:28:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two links</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.840" end="02:28:16.399" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="02:28:16.399" end="02:28:20.000" style="s2">is good and exactly what you want but</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.160" end="02:28:22.880" style="s2">link two is also pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.000" end="02:28:23.200" style="s2">right versus the scenario where link one</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.880" end="02:28:25.600" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="02:28:23.200" end="02:28:26.720" style="s2">terrible and link two is exactly what</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.600" end="02:28:28.160" style="s2">you want right there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.720" end="02:28:31.520" style="s2">distinguish terrible</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.160" end="02:28:33.200" style="s2">from also pretty good uh where like</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.520" end="02:28:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no inhibitory</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.200" end="02:28:37.680" style="s2">connections like that now different</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.160" end="02:28:39.120" style="s2">social media sites have done this kind</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.680" end="02:28:40.000" style="s2">of differently right some of them have</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.120" end="02:28:42.800" style="s2">upvotes and down</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.000" end="02:28:44.800" style="s2">votes some of them only have upvotes</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.800" end="02:28:46.399" style="s2">youtube comments have upvotes</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.800" end="02:28:55.840" style="s2">and down votes where they don&#39;t show you</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.399" end="02:28:55.840" style="s2">the number</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.840" end="02:29:14.240" style="s2">uh don&#39;t let masses determine</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.520" end="02:29:17.680" style="s2">what&#39;s um what&#39;s good or not</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.240" end="02:29:17.680" style="s2">who determines that right</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.319" end="02:29:26.160" style="s2">like is there like a hm</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.160" end="02:29:37.840" style="s2">so you have curated blogs you you have</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.160" end="02:29:37.840" style="s2">curated blogs guern&#39;s a curated blog</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.840" end="02:29:52.080" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.240" end="02:29:55.120" style="s2">i mean this this is this is this is</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.080" end="02:29:57.520" style="s2">interesting stuff too</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.120" end="02:29:57.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.680" end="02:30:05.840" style="s2">one of the things that</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.280" end="02:30:10.479" style="s2">some countries going to do this</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.960" end="02:30:14.880" style="s2">right some country is going to start</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.200" end="02:30:18.800" style="s2">intelligence amplification i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.680" end="02:30:20.479" style="s2">how all this works</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.800" end="02:30:22.080" style="s2">but if you could do the you know okay so</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.479" end="02:30:25.520" style="s2">you you you give</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.080" end="02:30:29.120" style="s2">let&#39;s assume iq is valid i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.520" end="02:30:29.120" style="s2">not gonna have that debate but um</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.600" end="02:30:32.880" style="s2">whatever your proxy method is right or</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.520" end="02:30:34.080" style="s2">you want wealth you want anything you</p>
<p begin="02:30:32.880" end="02:30:35.280" style="s2">want to make you want to make rich kids</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.080" end="02:30:38.960" style="s2">you want to make smart kids the same</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.280" end="02:30:41.760" style="s2">same method works um take</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.960" end="02:30:42.960" style="s2">tons of people&#39;s dna and then do</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.760" end="02:30:45.280" style="s2">correlation analysis</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.960" end="02:30:46.640" style="s2">figure out which genes are you know more</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.280" end="02:30:48.720" style="s2">more likely to make intelligent which</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.640" end="02:30:52.720" style="s2">genes are more likely to make you rich</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.720" end="02:30:56.399" style="s2">and then do embryo selection on that</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.720" end="02:30:58.560" style="s2">um you might even be able to do this</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.399" end="02:31:00.240" style="s2">like recursively right you can maybe do</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.560" end="02:31:03.680" style="s2">it every other generation</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.240" end="02:31:06.399" style="s2">but the first country that does this</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.680" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">is going to in my opinion so clearly</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.399" end="02:31:15.840" style="s2">dominate the world</p>
<p begin="02:31:16.640" end="02:31:20.800" style="s2">no this isn&#39;t gattica right gattaca is</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.800" end="02:31:23.280" style="s2">about taking the people who are already</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.800" end="02:31:24.080" style="s2">born and saying you can or can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.280" end="02:31:26.720" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="02:31:24.080" end="02:31:28.240" style="s2">um intelligence tests or based on</p>
<p begin="02:31:26.720" end="02:31:31.359" style="s2">genetic tests for</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.240" end="02:31:32.080" style="s2">whatever proxies they want uh but this</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.359" end="02:31:33.760" style="s2">is just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.080" end="02:31:35.200" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a form of it&#39;s a form</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.760" end="02:31:38.080" style="s2">of eugenics right</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.200" end="02:31:39.040" style="s2">um again oh eugenics it gets a bad rap</p>
<p begin="02:31:38.080" end="02:31:40.720" style="s2">yeah because you know</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.040" end="02:31:42.240" style="s2">historically eugenics has been used to</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.720" end="02:31:57.840" style="s2">force people to do things</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.240" end="02:31:57.840" style="s2">this isn&#39;t forcing anybody</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.319" end="02:32:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.280" end="02:32:47.200" style="s2">oh see you gotta trust corn</p>
<p begin="02:32:44.880" end="02:32:49.600" style="s2">studies of economics typically find that</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.200" end="02:32:51.680" style="s2">one iq point corresponds to an increase</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.600" end="02:32:52.000" style="s2">of wages on the order of one percent</p>
<p begin="02:32:51.680" end="02:32:54.640" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.000" end="02:32:54.640" style="s2">things equal</p>
<p begin="02:32:55.840" end="02:32:59.200" style="s2">see this is this is how everybody in the</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.080" end="02:33:00.720" style="s2">world should talk</p>
<p begin="02:32:59.200" end="02:33:03.920" style="s2">i wish i could talk more like this you</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.720" end="02:33:03.920" style="s2">know we should all strive to</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.160" end="02:33:07.840" style="s2">a whole list of citations</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.960" end="02:33:12.800" style="s2">and i trust that like warren read it</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.840" end="02:33:21.840" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.240" end="02:34:03.520" style="s2">all right all right let&#39;s let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.280" end="02:34:05.520" style="s2">to teleps thing on iq</p>
<p begin="02:34:03.520" end="02:34:09.120" style="s2">yeah this is the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.520" end="02:34:09.120" style="s2">derailment unfortunately</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.359" end="02:34:15.840" style="s2">but now i feel like you know</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.479" end="02:34:16.880" style="s2">here&#39;s maybe uh a good rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="02:34:15.840" end="02:34:19.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.880" end="02:34:19.680" style="s2">i heard a</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.160" end="02:34:22.479" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.120" end="02:34:29.680" style="s2">this was in a class on on relationships</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.840" end="02:34:33.680" style="s2">at northwestern</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.680" end="02:34:36.240" style="s2">where the professor said in order to</p>
<p begin="02:34:33.680" end="02:34:37.439" style="s2">to have a successful relationship uh you</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.240" end="02:34:39.680" style="s2">have to have sex five</p>
<p begin="02:34:37.439" end="02:34:40.560" style="s2">times more than you fight for every one</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.680" end="02:34:43.280" style="s2">fight</p>
<p begin="02:34:40.560" end="02:34:44.240" style="s2">um you have to uh couples that do this</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.280" end="02:34:46.560" style="s2">couples that show</p>
<p begin="02:34:44.240" end="02:34:48.160" style="s2">this basic ratio do well i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.560" end="02:34:49.280" style="s2">completely anecdotal but</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.160" end="02:34:51.920" style="s2">i mean i almost think the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.280" end="02:34:55.520" style="s2">with controversy and like you know real</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.920" end="02:34:57.760" style="s2">real truthful right you you need to you</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.520" end="02:35:01.200" style="s2">can&#39;t have just controversy</p>
<p begin="02:34:57.760" end="02:35:04.160" style="s2">but if you have no if you if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.200" end="02:35:06.160" style="s2">finding truth about esoteric things the</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.160" end="02:35:07.760" style="s2">unobama refers this to this is like</p>
<p begin="02:35:06.160" end="02:35:09.280" style="s2">surrogate activities right</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.760" end="02:35:10.800" style="s2">like truths that are completely</p>
<p begin="02:35:09.280" end="02:35:14.000" style="s2">irrelevant to</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.800" end="02:35:17.120" style="s2">the modern world like oh well no</p>
<p begin="02:35:14.000" end="02:35:19.840" style="s2">so algae is turned from blue to</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.120" end="02:35:21.840" style="s2">yellow in the presence of dimethyl</p>
<p begin="02:35:19.840" end="02:35:23.200" style="s2">sulfoxide like okay</p>
<p begin="02:35:21.840" end="02:35:25.760" style="s2">i mean that might be true but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.200" end="02:35:27.840" style="s2">irrelevant you need to keep a good ratio</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.760" end="02:35:32.080" style="s2">you need to keep a good ratio between</p>
<p begin="02:35:27.840" end="02:35:32.080" style="s2">controversy and uh</p>
<p begin="02:35:32.399" end="02:35:35.840" style="s2">and truth finding with a whole lot more</p>
<p begin="02:35:33.840" end="02:35:39.920" style="s2">truth finding a whole lot more sex</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.840" end="02:35:43.840" style="s2">than um i&#39;ll read some stuff on</p>
<p begin="02:35:39.920" end="02:35:43.840" style="s2">interpretation of statistics</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.160" end="02:35:56.720" style="s2">if an idea unless it&#39;s an unreasoned</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.399" end="02:35:58.160" style="s2">ideological immune response my prior is</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.720" end="02:36:01.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="02:35:58.160" end="02:36:04.080" style="s2">no i mean i think one big example</p>
<p begin="02:36:01.280" end="02:36:06.880" style="s2">against that is like holocaust denialism</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.080" end="02:36:08.240" style="s2">right you have people who get very upset</p>
<p begin="02:36:06.880" end="02:36:10.560" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="02:36:08.240" end="02:36:12.080" style="s2">but like you know it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.560" end="02:36:14.800" style="s2">true right which is which is weird i</p>
<p begin="02:36:12.080" end="02:36:18.000" style="s2">always find these denialism things</p>
<p begin="02:36:14.800" end="02:36:20.640" style="s2">um climate change denialism there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.000" end="02:36:23.040" style="s2">big ideological immune response</p>
<p begin="02:36:20.640" end="02:36:25.120" style="s2">uh to that like people oh how could they</p>
<p begin="02:36:23.040" end="02:36:30.160" style="s2">say climate change isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="02:36:25.120" end="02:36:30.160" style="s2">but like i don&#39;t know it seems real</p>
<p begin="02:36:32.560" end="02:36:38.960" style="s2">at least like to an extent</p>
<p begin="02:36:36.000" end="02:36:42.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t trust the atlantic i don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="02:36:38.960" end="02:36:42.399" style="s2">any news websites on this</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.600" end="02:36:46.960" style="s2">news is propaganda</p>
<p begin="02:36:48.840" end="02:36:56.880" style="s2">um okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s analyze</p>
<p begin="02:36:53.520" end="02:36:59.200" style="s2">this as as dispassionately as possible</p>
<p begin="02:36:56.880" end="02:36:59.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.920" end="02:37:06.479" style="s2">iq is a stale test</p>
<p begin="02:37:04.240" end="02:37:08.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m not sure what that means right</p>
<p begin="02:37:06.479" end="02:37:10.720" style="s2">like because it&#39;s old it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="02:37:08.720" end="02:37:14.800" style="s2">i think generally we found on the stream</p>
<p begin="02:37:10.720" end="02:37:14.800" style="s2">that the opposite is true</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.840" end="02:37:19.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:37:31.439" end="02:37:37.359" style="s2">the concept is poorly thought out</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.600" end="02:37:40.000" style="s2">mathematically by the field</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.359" end="02:37:41.359" style="s2">see just just just just looking at these</p>
<p begin="02:37:40.000" end="02:37:44.240" style="s2">two things</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.359" end="02:37:44.240" style="s2">from a uh</p>
<p begin="02:37:44.399" end="02:37:48.240" style="s2">like kind of naive perspective this one</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.720" end="02:37:50.560" style="s2">has a lot of studies</p>
<p begin="02:37:48.240" end="02:37:52.560" style="s2">this one it has a lot of links to to</p>
<p begin="02:37:50.560" end="02:37:54.960" style="s2">external studies where you can verify</p>
<p begin="02:37:52.560" end="02:37:57.120" style="s2">each statement whereas this whole</p>
<p begin="02:37:54.960" end="02:38:00.080" style="s2">paragraph doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:53:36.080" end="02:53:41.040" style="s2">um computers have this cool</p>
<p begin="02:53:39.439" end="02:53:43.680" style="s2">computers don&#39;t learn the same way</p>
<p begin="02:53:41.040" end="02:53:43.680" style="s2">humans do</p>
<p begin="02:53:47.680" end="02:53:51.840" style="s2">um computers or this fourth paradigm of</p>
<p begin="02:53:50.800" end="02:53:52.960" style="s2">learning if you think of the first</p>
<p begin="02:53:51.840" end="02:53:54.319" style="s2">paradigm of learning is like</p>
<p begin="02:53:52.960" end="02:53:56.319" style="s2">single-celled organisms</p>
<p begin="02:53:54.319" end="02:53:57.840" style="s2">and single-celled organisms learn not to</p>
<p begin="02:53:56.319" end="02:54:00.000" style="s2">go to the light by all the ones going to</p>
<p begin="02:53:57.840" end="02:54:02.720" style="s2">the light dying whatever genetic code</p>
<p begin="02:54:00.000" end="02:54:04.080" style="s2">makes them go to the light uh dies out</p>
<p begin="02:54:02.720" end="02:54:05.200" style="s2">slowly and then you know they all go</p>
<p begin="02:54:04.080" end="02:54:07.200" style="s2">away from the light</p>
<p begin="02:54:05.200" end="02:54:08.560" style="s2">right uh first paranoid of learning the</p>
<p begin="02:54:07.200" end="02:54:10.399" style="s2">second paradigm of learning is like how</p>
<p begin="02:54:08.560" end="02:54:10.880" style="s2">rats learn right you can take a cage in</p>
<p begin="02:54:10.399" end="02:54:12.560" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="02:54:10.880" end="02:54:13.840" style="s2">you know put around a cage and electrify</p>
<p begin="02:54:12.560" end="02:54:15.279" style="s2">one of the grid cells and the rat</p>
<p begin="02:54:13.840" end="02:54:16.080" style="s2">touches it the rats like oh yeah that</p>
<p begin="02:54:15.279" end="02:54:18.240" style="s2">hurt</p>
<p begin="02:54:16.080" end="02:54:20.479" style="s2">um and the rat won&#39;t uh the rat will go</p>
<p begin="02:54:18.240" end="02:54:22.399" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="02:54:20.479" end="02:54:24.080" style="s2">and not touch it anymore and they might</p>
<p begin="02:54:22.399" end="02:54:25.439" style="s2">even be able to communicate this to the</p>
<p begin="02:54:24.080" end="02:54:26.960" style="s2">fellow rats in the cage but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:54:25.439" end="02:54:28.640" style="s2">definitely not going to leave a rat</p>
<p begin="02:54:26.960" end="02:54:29.359" style="s2">encyclopedia about how you shouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="02:54:28.640" end="02:54:31.760" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="02:54:29.359" end="02:54:33.359" style="s2">tile on the third paradigm of learning</p>
<p begin="02:54:31.760" end="02:54:35.600" style="s2">is human it&#39;s cultural</p>
<p begin="02:54:33.359" end="02:54:37.520" style="s2">right we learn god we all thought there</p>
<p begin="02:54:35.600" end="02:54:38.960" style="s2">was deep things in 2000 years of chess</p>
<p begin="02:54:37.520" end="02:54:41.520" style="s2">culture until</p>
<p begin="02:54:38.960" end="02:54:43.439" style="s2">until alpha zero came around and uh</p>
<p begin="02:54:41.520" end="02:54:46.319" style="s2">relearned all of chess and rediscovered</p>
<p begin="02:54:43.439" end="02:54:49.120" style="s2">all of chess theory in 24 hours</p>
<p begin="02:54:46.319" end="02:54:50.479" style="s2">um but yeah humans learn culturally and</p>
<p begin="02:54:49.120" end="02:54:51.920" style="s2">pass things down through generations and</p>
<p begin="02:54:50.479" end="02:54:54.319" style="s2">you stand on the shoulder of giants</p>
<p begin="02:54:51.920" end="02:54:55.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a good quote</p>
<p begin="02:54:54.319" end="02:54:57.439" style="s2">uh and then there&#39;s this fourth paradigm</p>
<p begin="02:54:55.920" end="02:54:57.920" style="s2">of learning and the fourth paradigm of</p>
<p begin="02:54:57.439" end="02:55:00.160" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="02:54:57.920" end="02:55:01.520" style="s2">is i know kung fu the fourth pound i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:55:00.160" end="02:55:03.040" style="s2">learning is plugging a wire into the</p>
<p begin="02:55:01.520" end="02:55:04.880" style="s2">back of your head and instead of having</p>
<p begin="02:55:03.040" end="02:55:06.240" style="s2">to go through 10 years of training sure</p>
<p begin="02:55:04.880" end="02:55:07.600" style="s2">you can learn it through books but the</p>
<p begin="02:55:06.240" end="02:55:10.880" style="s2">learning itself is still</p>
<p begin="02:55:07.600" end="02:55:12.399" style="s2">hard you just put the thing in and say i</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.880" end="02:55:17.840" style="s2">know kung fu</p>
<p begin="02:55:12.399" end="02:55:17.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s how computers learn</p>
<p begin="02:55:24.080" end="02:55:26.479" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:55:29.760" end="02:55:34.640" style="s2">you have a hard time relating to my</p>
<p begin="02:55:31.680" end="02:55:34.640" style="s2">concerns well</p>
<p begin="02:55:35.040" end="02:55:38.080" style="s2">because of maslov&#39;s hierarchy of needs</p>

<p begin="02:56:00.479" end="02:56:02.560" style="s2">you know i could i could play the song</p>
<p begin="02:56:01.760" end="02:56:04.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="02:56:02.560" end="02:56:07.120" style="s2">uh then i&#39;ll get copyright striked who</p>
<p begin="02:56:04.880" end="02:56:08.160" style="s2">are we are we the intellects or the</p>

<p begin="02:56:08.160" end="02:56:11.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not the ones who will ever know</p>
<p begin="02:56:09.439" end="02:56:13.120" style="s2">the answer it&#39;s impossible for us to</p>
<p begin="02:56:11.520" end="02:56:15.359" style="s2">imagine what&#39;s right in front of us and</p>
<p begin="02:56:13.120" end="02:56:18.399" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s what makes us human</p>
<p begin="02:56:15.359" end="02:56:21.120" style="s2">but being human only lets us see a</p>
<p begin="02:56:18.399" end="02:56:25.040" style="s2">little further than the animals</p>
<p begin="02:56:21.120" end="02:56:26.720" style="s2">oh right like you say yeah okay whatever</p>
<p begin="02:56:25.040" end="02:56:30.479" style="s2">your whatever your needs are</p>
<p begin="02:56:26.720" end="02:56:32.960" style="s2">now like look i do i care</p>
<p begin="02:56:30.479" end="02:56:34.560" style="s2">do i care if if the world&#39;s on board</p>
<p begin="02:56:32.960" end="02:56:37.520" style="s2">with fighting the singularity what does</p>
<p begin="02:56:34.560" end="02:56:40.160" style="s2">fighting the singularity even mean</p>
<p begin="02:56:37.520" end="02:56:43.279" style="s2">right do we do we not the unibomber do</p>
<p begin="02:56:40.160" end="02:56:45.920" style="s2">we mail bombs the compsci professors</p>
<p begin="02:56:43.279" end="02:56:46.800" style="s2">kidding bro like that&#39;s a joke like like</p>
<p begin="02:56:45.920" end="02:56:49.040" style="s2">why you do that</p>

<p begin="02:57:11.359" end="02:57:23.840" style="s2">how is nuclear proliferation</p>
<p begin="02:57:37.520" end="02:57:41.760" style="s2">well yeah but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:57:47.520" end="02:57:51.200" style="s2">i i wonder if the right metric here is</p>
<p begin="02:57:50.160" end="02:57:53.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="02:57:51.200" end="02:57:54.399" style="s2">number of nuclear missiles right if one</p>
<p begin="02:57:53.520" end="02:57:56.160" style="s2">person has</p>
<p begin="02:57:54.399" end="02:57:58.399" style="s2">ten thousand nuclear missiles that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:57:56.160" end="02:58:00.479" style="s2">so different i would much rather</p>
<p begin="02:57:58.399" end="02:58:02.840" style="s2">one person have ten thousand nuclear</p>
<p begin="02:58:00.479" end="02:58:05.840" style="s2">missiles than a hundred people each have</p>
<p begin="02:58:02.840" end="02:58:05.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="02:58:14.479" end="02:58:19.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a doomsday clock</p>
<p begin="02:58:26.080" end="02:58:29.439" style="s2">all right i think we&#39;ll leave you guys i</p>
<p begin="02:58:28.399" end="02:58:30.840" style="s2">think i have i have a little</p>
<p begin="02:58:29.439" end="02:58:34.160" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="02:58:30.840" end="02:58:37.439" style="s2">um that i gave</p>
<p begin="02:58:34.160" end="02:58:37.439" style="s2">we could do this presentation</p>
<p begin="02:58:44.840" end="02:58:50.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:58:47.600" end="02:58:53.439" style="s2">guys i don&#39;t know how to fix a voice i</p>
<p begin="02:58:50.240" end="02:58:53.439" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to fix it you know</p>
<p begin="02:58:55.120" end="02:59:01.200" style="s2">um disclaimer</p>
<p begin="02:58:58.160" end="02:59:04.080" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="02:59:01.200" end="02:59:05.120" style="s2">uh so yeah you have uh synapses and</p>
<p begin="02:59:04.080" end="02:59:06.560" style="s2">neurons</p>
<p begin="02:59:05.120" end="02:59:08.240" style="s2">uh so when you look at this is the new</p>
<p begin="02:59:06.560" end="02:59:11.040" style="s2">tesla chip</p>
<p begin="02:59:08.240" end="02:59:13.680" style="s2">um they have multiply accumulates uh</p>
<p begin="02:59:11.040" end="02:59:15.279" style="s2">multiplies look like synapses</p>
<p begin="02:59:13.680" end="02:59:17.439" style="s2">and accumulate to look like neurons</p>
<p begin="02:59:15.279" end="02:59:19.600" style="s2">right so you have uh different</p>
<p begin="02:59:17.439" end="02:59:21.040" style="s2">well i think i have yeah the synapse is</p>
<p begin="02:59:19.600" end="02:59:22.640" style="s2">a multiplier with a learned weight and</p>
<p begin="02:59:21.040" end="02:59:25.840" style="s2">the neuron is an accumulator</p>
<p begin="02:59:22.640" end="02:59:28.479" style="s2">um so max approximately correspond</p>
<p begin="02:59:25.840" end="02:59:30.080" style="s2">to the number of synapses right not to</p>
<p begin="02:59:28.479" end="02:59:32.560" style="s2">the number of neurons</p>
<p begin="02:59:30.080" end="02:59:34.800" style="s2">uh because the neuron is all of the the</p>
<p begin="02:59:32.560" end="02:59:37.600" style="s2">accumulation done</p>
<p begin="02:59:34.800" end="02:59:38.160" style="s2">uh so bioflops is synapses times clock</p>
<p begin="02:59:37.600" end="02:59:40.000" style="s2">rate right</p>
<p begin="02:59:38.160" end="02:59:41.439" style="s2">so that&#39;s the metric we&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="02:59:40.000" end="02:59:43.920" style="s2">um so here&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="02:59:41.439" end="02:59:46.000" style="s2">your boy c elegans um c elegans is about</p>
<p begin="02:59:43.920" end="02:59:49.279" style="s2">the same as an altair 8800</p>
<p begin="02:59:46.000" end="02:59:49.600" style="s2">uh so this is the smallest uh organism</p>
<p begin="02:59:49.279" end="02:59:52.800" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="02:59:49.600" end="02:59:54.240" style="s2">a nervous system um</p>
<p begin="02:59:52.800" end="02:59:55.760" style="s2">as i said and right how many neurons it</p>
<p begin="02:59:54.240" end="02:59:56.000" style="s2">has it has like 200 neurons and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:59:55.760" end="03:00:00.000" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="02:59:56.000" end="03:00:02.160" style="s2">what you could simulate in an altair um</p>
<p begin="03:00:00.000" end="03:00:03.120" style="s2">we have an ant uh and it&#39;s about two</p>
<p begin="03:00:02.160" end="03:00:04.720" style="s2">gigaflops</p>
<p begin="03:00:03.120" end="03:00:06.479" style="s2">of compute power you know a surprising</p>
<p begin="03:00:04.720" end="03:00:08.319" style="s2">amount big leap from c elegans to ants</p>
<p begin="03:00:06.479" end="03:00:09.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s about a raspberry pi</p>
<p begin="03:00:08.319" end="03:00:12.000" style="s2">an old raspberry pi the new ones have a</p>
<p begin="03:00:09.920" end="03:00:14.399" style="s2">bit more but so you know</p>
<p begin="03:00:12.000" end="03:00:17.200" style="s2">raspberry pi and about the same that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:00:14.399" end="03:00:19.920" style="s2">about 20 000 c elegans</p>
<p begin="03:00:17.200" end="03:00:21.200" style="s2">uh so here&#39;s a b uh b is about 500 amps</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.920" end="03:00:22.240" style="s2">they&#39;re way smarter than ants look at</p>
<p begin="03:00:21.200" end="03:00:25.359" style="s2">them you can just tell right</p>
<p begin="03:00:22.240" end="03:00:28.000" style="s2">that thing looks dumb man looks dumb</p>
<p begin="03:00:25.359" end="03:00:29.680" style="s2">that looks a lot smarter you know it</p>
<p begin="03:00:28.000" end="03:00:32.160" style="s2">grew all those little fuzzies it has all</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.680" end="03:00:36.080" style="s2">those little intricate feelers</p>
<p begin="03:00:32.160" end="03:00:38.479" style="s2">um b has about uh</p>
<p begin="03:00:36.080" end="03:00:39.359" style="s2">200 gigaflops compute which is about the</p>
<p begin="03:00:38.479" end="03:00:43.120" style="s2">same as a</p>
<p begin="03:00:39.359" end="03:00:43.120" style="s2">uh common two um</p>
<p begin="03:00:44.720" end="03:00:48.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s about 500 ants i&#39;ll say you get</p>
<p begin="03:00:47.120" end="03:00:50.080" style="s2">to a mouse</p>
<p begin="03:00:48.240" end="03:00:52.720" style="s2">uh if you guys have ever i mean i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="03:00:50.080" end="03:00:54.640" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve interacted with bees</p>
<p begin="03:00:52.720" end="03:00:56.399" style="s2">and auntie you crush an ant you know</p>
<p begin="03:00:54.640" end="03:00:59.760" style="s2">okay yeah yeah okay it&#39;s an ant</p>
<p begin="03:00:56.399" end="03:01:01.359" style="s2">um a b well they&#39;re a little more</p>
<p begin="03:00:59.760" end="03:01:03.279" style="s2">skeptical of bees you know you can tell</p>
<p begin="03:01:01.359" end="03:01:05.840" style="s2">every you kind of know intuitively that</p>
<p begin="03:01:03.279" end="03:01:07.520" style="s2">bees are a bit of chappy versus virgin</p>
<p begin="03:01:05.840" end="03:01:10.720" style="s2">ant</p>
<p begin="03:01:07.520" end="03:01:13.760" style="s2">um a mouse</p>
<p begin="03:01:10.720" end="03:01:15.920" style="s2">uh 100 teraflops</p>
<p begin="03:01:13.760" end="03:01:17.120" style="s2">so about the same as a bunch of uh as a</p>
<p begin="03:01:15.920" end="03:01:19.279" style="s2">bunch of g-forces and</p>
<p begin="03:01:17.120" end="03:01:21.359" style="s2">i had when i lived in palo alto i had</p>
<p begin="03:01:19.279" end="03:01:24.000" style="s2">two pet mice princess and misty</p>
<p begin="03:01:21.359" end="03:01:25.120" style="s2">uh and yeah i taught them to i taught</p>
<p begin="03:01:24.000" end="03:01:26.960" style="s2">them to run mazes</p>
<p begin="03:01:25.120" end="03:01:28.479" style="s2">and they&#39;re very they&#39;re very smart and</p>
<p begin="03:01:26.960" end="03:01:30.000" style="s2">you can you can tell they&#39;re clever you</p>
<p begin="03:01:28.479" end="03:01:34.160" style="s2">just look at them and you&#39;re like wow</p>
<p begin="03:01:30.000" end="03:01:37.520" style="s2">um so that&#39;s 100 teraflops gets you yes</p>
<p begin="03:01:34.160" end="03:01:41.120" style="s2">a cat is about two petaflops</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.520" end="03:01:42.479" style="s2">uh maybe one rack um</p>
<p begin="03:01:41.120" end="03:01:44.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i have it in here but for</p>
<p begin="03:01:42.479" end="03:01:44.560" style="s2">reference dogs are actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:01:44.240" end="03:01:46.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="03:01:44.560" end="03:01:48.319" style="s2">twice the neurons of of cats so you know</p>
<p begin="03:01:46.960" end="03:01:51.279" style="s2">dog dog owners</p>
<p begin="03:01:48.319" end="03:01:53.200" style="s2">a cat&#39;s about 20 mice uh that seems</p>
<p begin="03:01:51.279" end="03:01:55.359" style="s2">about seems about right</p>
<p begin="03:01:53.200" end="03:01:56.479" style="s2">um humans are 20 peter flops or about 10</p>
<p begin="03:01:55.359" end="03:01:58.960" style="s2">cats</p>
<p begin="03:01:56.479" end="03:02:00.880" style="s2">you you know whenever a cat lady has</p>
<p begin="03:01:58.960" end="03:02:03.200" style="s2">more than 10 cats</p>
<p begin="03:02:00.880" end="03:02:03.920" style="s2">the total number of cat flops in her</p>
<p begin="03:02:03.200" end="03:02:06.720" style="s2">apartment</p>
<p begin="03:02:03.920" end="03:02:08.640" style="s2">exceeds her number of flops um how is</p>
<p begin="03:02:06.720" end="03:02:09.040" style="s2">this measured it&#39;s synapses times clock</p>
<p begin="03:02:08.640" end="03:02:11.760" style="s2">rate</p>
<p begin="03:02:09.040" end="03:02:14.000" style="s2">right bioflops um you can look</p>
<p begin="03:02:11.760" end="03:02:17.840" style="s2">wikipedia&#39;s got a good uh</p>
<p begin="03:02:14.000" end="03:02:17.840" style="s2">got a good article for this</p>
<p begin="03:02:28.840" end="03:02:31.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:02:41.680" end="03:02:48.479" style="s2">this tells you uh so this is neurons</p>
<p begin="03:02:46.319" end="03:02:51.520" style="s2">but synapses is just it&#39;s your fan out</p>
<p begin="03:02:48.479" end="03:02:51.520" style="s2">factor on neurons</p>
<p begin="03:02:51.600" end="03:02:54.720" style="s2">so you can go through all the animals</p>
<p begin="03:02:52.880" end="03:02:58.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s a rough ranking of</p>
<p begin="03:02:54.720" end="03:02:59.600" style="s2">um you know then you get uh humans and</p>
<p begin="03:02:58.319" end="03:03:02.640" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="03:02:59.600" end="03:03:02.640" style="s2">god tier elephants</p>
<p begin="03:03:03.200" end="03:03:09.359" style="s2">so human about 20 cats and is about one</p>
<p begin="03:03:05.520" end="03:03:09.359" style="s2">rack of google tpu v3s</p>
<p begin="03:03:11.120" end="03:03:15.600" style="s2">uh bioflopsy now this time clock right</p>
<p begin="03:03:13.120" end="03:03:19.680" style="s2">so here&#39;s basically a summarization</p>
<p begin="03:03:15.600" end="03:03:19.680" style="s2">um putting it in uh in log scale</p>
<p begin="03:03:19.840" end="03:03:24.960" style="s2">um now it&#39;s wrong to talk about</p>
<p begin="03:03:23.040" end="03:03:26.720" style="s2">um you can&#39;t do much with twenty page</p>
<p begin="03:03:24.960" end="03:03:29.120" style="s2">flaps uh humanity is</p>
<p begin="03:03:26.720" end="03:03:31.040" style="s2">a network uh so this is the the world</p>
<p begin="03:03:29.120" end="03:03:33.600" style="s2">population there&#39;s you know real</p>
<p begin="03:03:31.040" end="03:03:35.359" style="s2">singularity looking looking stuff right</p>
<p begin="03:03:33.600" end="03:03:35.760" style="s2">there is no singularity and exponential</p>
<p begin="03:03:35.359" end="03:03:38.880" style="s2">looks</p>
<p begin="03:03:35.760" end="03:03:42.479" style="s2">the same every point you zoom to</p>
<p begin="03:03:38.880" end="03:03:44.479" style="s2">um cats are not networked</p>
<p begin="03:03:42.479" end="03:03:46.800" style="s2">uh cats are solo animals dogs are on</p>
<p begin="03:03:44.479" end="03:03:49.279" style="s2">lands but only humans are networked like</p>
<p begin="03:03:46.800" end="03:03:49.279" style="s2">the internet</p>
<p begin="03:03:51.439" end="03:03:56.560" style="s2">um this is years and population</p>
<p begin="03:03:58.800" end="03:04:04.000" style="s2">the rise of humanity was due to our</p>
<p begin="03:04:00.800" end="03:04:04.000" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="03:04:04.880" end="03:04:08.160" style="s2">i see no reason why we should assume the</p>
<p begin="03:04:06.720" end="03:04:11.279" style="s2">brain software is particularly</p>
<p begin="03:04:08.160" end="03:04:11.279" style="s2">good given its hardware</p>
<p begin="03:04:11.920" end="03:04:15.680" style="s2">compute is a good proxy for intelligence</p>
<p begin="03:04:13.760" end="03:04:18.000" style="s2">broadly</p>
<p begin="03:04:15.680" end="03:04:19.200" style="s2">if you believe these three things oh</p>
<p begin="03:04:18.000" end="03:04:20.720" style="s2">yeah software and hardware proceed</p>
<p begin="03:04:19.200" end="03:04:22.720" style="s2">similar rates i saw i saw</p>
<p begin="03:04:20.720" end="03:04:24.080" style="s2">more concrete breakdown of this recently</p>
<p begin="03:04:22.720" end="03:04:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s just an open ai paper that</p>
<p begin="03:04:24.080" end="03:04:26.800" style="s2">talked about this</p>
<p begin="03:04:27.840" end="03:04:34.240" style="s2">number of bio flops in the world</p>
<p begin="03:04:30.960" end="03:04:37.040" style="s2">well 7.8 billion people</p>
<p begin="03:04:34.240" end="03:04:39.840" style="s2">uh this is just a rough like the cats</p>
<p begin="03:04:37.040" end="03:04:42.960" style="s2">and the mice don&#39;t really count for much</p>
<p begin="03:04:39.840" end="03:04:46.319" style="s2">so the total number of flops</p>
<p begin="03:04:42.960" end="03:04:48.720" style="s2">in humanity is like 10 to the 26th</p>
<p begin="03:04:46.319" end="03:04:51.200" style="s2">so we got like 10 to the 26 total flies</p>
<p begin="03:04:48.720" end="03:04:51.760" style="s2">how many total silicon flops are there</p>
<p begin="03:04:51.200" end="03:04:53.520" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="03:04:51.760" end="03:04:54.880" style="s2">a hundred billion pedo flops or a</p>
<p begin="03:04:53.520" end="03:04:56.240" style="s2">hundred trillion teraflops so for</p>
<p begin="03:04:54.880" end="03:04:58.880" style="s2">reference your phone is</p>
<p begin="03:04:56.240" end="03:04:59.520" style="s2">approximately a teraflop they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="03:04:58.880" end="03:05:01.279" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="03:04:59.520" end="03:05:02.800" style="s2">but clearly you know let&#39;s say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:05:01.279" end="03:05:04.319" style="s2">10 billion phones in the world 100</p>
<p begin="03:05:02.800" end="03:05:06.399" style="s2">trillion is uh</p>
<p begin="03:05:04.319" end="03:05:08.720" style="s2">10 000 times bigger so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="03:05:06.399" end="03:05:11.200" style="s2">more biological compute in the world</p>
<p begin="03:05:08.720" end="03:05:12.960" style="s2">than silicon compute it&#39;s total computer</p>
<p begin="03:05:11.200" end="03:05:16.399" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="03:05:12.960" end="03:05:18.880" style="s2">number of silicon flux in the world</p>
<p begin="03:05:16.399" end="03:05:22.399" style="s2">about 10 to the 21 so we&#39;re off by a</p>
<p begin="03:05:18.880" end="03:05:22.399" style="s2">factor of about 10 to the 5.</p>
<p begin="03:05:23.200" end="03:05:26.479" style="s2">here&#39;s the trend over time</p>
<p begin="03:05:30.080" end="03:05:33.760" style="s2">at some point before this happens</p>
<p begin="03:05:32.479" end="03:05:36.960" style="s2">assuming current</p>
<p begin="03:05:33.760" end="03:05:39.120" style="s2">growth rates of computers</p>
<p begin="03:05:36.960" end="03:05:40.800" style="s2">stay the same which they may not as</p>
<p begin="03:05:39.120" end="03:05:42.160" style="s2">computers become more economically</p>
<p begin="03:05:40.800" end="03:05:45.279" style="s2">productive we may put</p>
<p begin="03:05:42.160" end="03:05:46.880" style="s2">more and more of our resources uh into</p>
<p begin="03:05:45.279" end="03:05:49.680" style="s2">building computers</p>
<p begin="03:05:46.880" end="03:05:49.680" style="s2">but either way</p>
<p begin="03:05:51.680" end="03:05:55.120" style="s2">oh yeah the human population</p>
<p begin="03:05:55.840" end="03:05:59.040" style="s2">when the green line goes above the blue</p>
<p begin="03:05:58.240" end="03:06:01.520" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="03:05:59.040" end="03:06:04.080" style="s2">we are no longer the dominant species on</p>
<p begin="03:06:01.520" end="03:06:04.080" style="s2">the planet</p>
<p begin="03:06:11.439" end="03:06:15.840" style="s2">so how long do we have well</p>
<p begin="03:06:16.080" end="03:06:24.240" style="s2">30 years 40 years</p>
<p begin="03:06:19.359" end="03:06:26.000" style="s2">uh the end of humanity has already been</p>
<p begin="03:06:24.240" end="03:06:27.600" style="s2">very clearly predicted</p>
<p begin="03:06:26.000" end="03:06:30.000" style="s2">not the end right we&#39;re just no longer</p>
<p begin="03:06:27.600" end="03:06:31.600" style="s2">the horses didn&#39;t there are still horses</p>
<p begin="03:06:30.000" end="03:06:33.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a few horses</p>
<p begin="03:06:31.600" end="03:06:35.040" style="s2">you know we let children ride them at</p>
<p begin="03:06:33.600" end="03:06:37.680" style="s2">the zoos and say</p>
<p begin="03:06:35.040" end="03:06:40.160" style="s2">come ride the human witness the</p>
<p begin="03:06:37.680" end="03:06:43.040" style="s2">antiquated human as it struggles to use</p>
<p begin="03:06:40.160" end="03:06:45.359" style="s2">a keyboard</p>
<p begin="03:06:43.040" end="03:06:45.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:06:46.399" end="03:06:50.080" style="s2">i hope we&#39;re getting pets i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:06:48.399" end="03:06:51.520" style="s2">a lot worse fates than pets</p>
<p begin="03:06:50.080" end="03:06:53.920" style="s2">think of all the poor cows and chickens</p>
<p begin="03:06:51.520" end="03:06:53.920" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="03:06:54.840" end="03:06:57.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:06:58.160" end="03:07:04.640" style="s2">oh no we definitely don&#39;t uh war</p>
<p begin="03:07:01.760" end="03:07:06.319" style="s2">at least like old school style you know</p>
<p begin="03:07:04.640" end="03:07:07.920" style="s2">give a lot of young men guns and tell</p>
<p begin="03:07:06.319" end="03:07:08.880" style="s2">them to march in that vague direction</p>
<p begin="03:07:07.920" end="03:07:12.640" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="03:07:08.880" end="03:07:15.680" style="s2">happens when your population uh</p>
<p begin="03:07:12.640" end="03:07:16.880" style="s2">pyramids look like this right this is</p>
<p begin="03:07:15.680" end="03:07:19.680" style="s2">why you get</p>
<p begin="03:07:16.880" end="03:07:21.120" style="s2">uh local wars in africa because you have</p>
<p begin="03:07:19.680" end="03:07:25.359" style="s2">such a top-heavy uh</p>
<p begin="03:07:21.120" end="03:07:29.520" style="s2">population the we&#39;ll do that quick aside</p>
<p begin="03:07:25.359" end="03:07:38.000" style="s2">u.s population versus like</p>
<p begin="03:07:29.520" end="03:07:42.000" style="s2">nigeria population versus japan</p>
<p begin="03:07:38.000" end="03:07:42.000" style="s2">i mean here&#39;s u.s versus nigeria right</p>
<p begin="03:07:42.160" end="03:07:45.600" style="s2">um the united states one is rather</p>
<p begin="03:07:44.720" end="03:07:48.080" style="s2">phallic</p>
<p begin="03:07:45.600" end="03:07:52.800" style="s2">uh and people believe social security&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:07:48.080" end="03:07:54.960" style="s2">gonna work</p>
<p begin="03:07:52.800" end="03:07:56.960" style="s2">well i i mean so this idea that like</p>
<p begin="03:07:54.960" end="03:08:00.720" style="s2">like we&#39;re going to enter a new world</p>
<p begin="03:07:56.960" end="03:08:02.560" style="s2">war is from my pers like looking at this</p>
<p begin="03:08:00.720" end="03:08:04.479" style="s2">unlikely right who&#39;s going to fight this</p>
<p begin="03:08:02.560" end="03:08:07.359" style="s2">war we&#39;re going to send the boomers</p>
<p begin="03:08:04.479" end="03:08:08.479" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know about that um is it</p>
<p begin="03:08:07.359" end="03:08:10.880" style="s2">going to be some weird</p>
<p begin="03:08:08.479" end="03:08:14.240" style="s2">proxy cyber cold war thing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="03:08:10.880" end="03:08:16.640" style="s2">going on for the last 50 years sure</p>
<p begin="03:08:14.240" end="03:08:16.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:08:17.359" end="03:08:21.760" style="s2">the computers are reproducing a ton</p>
<p begin="03:08:19.279" end="03:08:24.080" style="s2">faster than we are</p>
<p begin="03:08:21.760" end="03:08:27.120" style="s2">in 2055 we&#39;re no longer the dominant</p>
<p begin="03:08:24.080" end="03:08:27.120" style="s2">species on the planet</p>
<p begin="03:08:29.439" end="03:08:34.800" style="s2">um total compute ever</p>
<p begin="03:08:32.560" end="03:08:36.720" style="s2">so about a trillion alpha zeros that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:08:34.800" end="03:08:40.160" style="s2">this is this is open ai&#39;s metric</p>
<p begin="03:08:36.720" end="03:08:40.160" style="s2">uh pay to flop second days</p>
<p begin="03:08:40.319" end="03:08:45.200" style="s2">um and then if you&#39;re a pure culturalist</p>
<p begin="03:08:43.600" end="03:08:47.040" style="s2">if you believe humanity is actually its</p>
<p begin="03:08:45.200" end="03:08:49.359" style="s2">culture when have computers</p>
<p begin="03:08:47.040" end="03:08:50.240" style="s2">done more flops than the total of</p>
<p begin="03:08:49.359" end="03:08:52.000" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="03:08:50.240" end="03:08:54.080" style="s2">it&#39;s 10 years later right so if you</p>
<p begin="03:08:52.000" end="03:08:57.520" style="s2">really want to make a culturalist</p>
<p begin="03:08:54.080" end="03:08:59.279" style="s2">hypothesis so yeah 1990</p>
<p begin="03:08:57.520" end="03:09:01.200" style="s2">all the compute in the world was one</p>
<p begin="03:08:59.279" end="03:09:03.359" style="s2">human oh guys it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="03:09:01.200" end="03:09:06.560" style="s2">cute look what it can do oh it can</p>
<p begin="03:09:03.359" end="03:09:09.359" style="s2">almost do human thingies</p>
<p begin="03:09:06.560" end="03:09:11.439" style="s2">2012 supercomputer crossed one human oh</p>
<p begin="03:09:09.359" end="03:09:14.479" style="s2">man it beat us at chess</p>
<p begin="03:09:11.439" end="03:09:15.920" style="s2">oh but it is only it is only one one one</p>
<p begin="03:09:14.479" end="03:09:18.160" style="s2">human there&#39;s only like 500</p>
<p begin="03:09:15.920" end="03:09:20.560" style="s2">supercomputers that&#39;s only 500 human</p>
<p begin="03:09:18.160" end="03:09:21.359" style="s2">we&#39;ve we we&#39;ve taken out smaller towns</p>
<p begin="03:09:20.560" end="03:09:23.760" style="s2">in that in</p>
<p begin="03:09:21.359" end="03:09:24.640" style="s2">in nam and another one was fine man you</p>
<p begin="03:09:23.760" end="03:09:28.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="03:09:24.640" end="03:09:30.319" style="s2">um yeah so here we are in 2020</p>
<p begin="03:09:28.160" end="03:09:31.680" style="s2">and a silicon human costs about 1</p>
<p begin="03:09:30.319" end="03:09:34.560" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="03:09:31.680" end="03:09:35.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s about 100 000 silicon humans</p>
<p begin="03:09:34.560" end="03:09:37.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="03:09:35.200" end="03:09:39.439" style="s2">so what&#39;s that the population of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="03:09:37.600" end="03:09:40.479" style="s2">2038 you know i like that date for the</p>
<p begin="03:09:39.439" end="03:09:44.560" style="s2">singularity</p>
<p begin="03:09:40.479" end="03:09:47.680" style="s2">um pc crosses one human uh 2055</p>
<p begin="03:09:44.560" end="03:09:50.160" style="s2">silicon flops more than bio silicon</p>
<p begin="03:09:47.680" end="03:09:52.560" style="s2">compute more than bio compute</p>
<p begin="03:09:50.160" end="03:09:54.319" style="s2">is this the singularity well my</p>
<p begin="03:09:52.560" end="03:09:55.520" style="s2">definition is when humans are capable</p>
<p begin="03:09:54.319" end="03:09:57.520" style="s2">well computers are capable of doing</p>

<p begin="03:10:00.880" end="03:10:05.359" style="s2">know this stuff</p>
<p begin="03:10:02.640" end="03:10:06.560" style="s2">um the top computer is 200 petaflops</p>
<p begin="03:10:05.359" end="03:10:09.120" style="s2">it&#39;s about 10 humans</p>
<p begin="03:10:06.560" end="03:10:10.399" style="s2">it&#39;s well under the number meaning teams</p>

<p begin="03:10:10.399" end="03:10:14.239" style="s2">collaborate</p>
<p begin="03:10:11.520" end="03:10:15.600" style="s2">right can computers effectively</p>
<p begin="03:10:14.239" end="03:10:18.080" style="s2">collaborate well computers can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="03:10:15.600" end="03:10:19.920" style="s2">collaborate in inflexible</p>
<p begin="03:10:18.080" end="03:10:21.760" style="s2">uh ways we haven&#39;t seen computers</p>
<p begin="03:10:19.920" end="03:10:23.840" style="s2">capable of collaborating in flexible</p>
<p begin="03:10:21.760" end="03:10:25.600" style="s2">ways the way humans can</p>
<p begin="03:10:23.840" end="03:10:27.600" style="s2">so teams of humans are now the dominant</p>

<p begin="03:10:27.600" end="03:10:32.239" style="s2">but once computers are 100x faster</p>
<p begin="03:10:30.720" end="03:10:34.479" style="s2">it kind of stands to reason that we can</p>

<p begin="03:11:37.200" end="03:11:42.560" style="s2">and we&#39;ll fight the singularity together</p>
<p begin="03:11:40.160" end="03:11:42.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:11:44.000" end="03:11:48.319" style="s2">yeah uh nothing matters human extinction</p>

<p begin="03:19:24.239" end="03:19:28.399" style="s2">but the cow should promote veganism</p>
<p begin="03:19:27.040" end="03:19:29.920" style="s2">should we should we get together and</p>
<p begin="03:19:28.399" end="03:19:33.439" style="s2">promote a system of ethics where the</p>

<p begin="03:19:41.520" end="03:19:43.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:19:44.800" end="03:19:49.600" style="s2">concretely one thing i have hoped for</p>
<p begin="03:19:47.520" end="03:19:51.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="03:19:49.600" end="03:19:53.359" style="s2">i mean we try this a bit with comma ai</p>
<p begin="03:19:51.600" end="03:19:56.399" style="s2">it was my best idea at the time</p>
<p begin="03:19:53.359" end="03:20:00.720" style="s2">is decentralization the more</p>
<p begin="03:19:56.399" end="03:20:02.560" style="s2">we can decentralize ai and power</p>
<p begin="03:20:00.720" end="03:20:04.160" style="s2">uh the better off i think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="03:20:02.560" end="03:20:09.200" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="03:20:04.160" end="03:20:09.200" style="s2">right um so</p>
<p begin="03:20:10.640" end="03:20:14.800" style="s2">we see we see a lot of you know i think</p>
<p begin="03:20:14.080" end="03:20:17.439" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="03:20:14.800" end="03:20:18.399" style="s2">a lot of people would agree that</p>
<p begin="03:20:17.439" end="03:20:21.040" style="s2">problems come</p>
<p begin="03:20:18.399" end="03:20:21.920" style="s2">from these from these centralizations of</p>
<p begin="03:20:21.040" end="03:20:23.680" style="s2">power and</p>
<p begin="03:20:21.920" end="03:20:26.399" style="s2">even the centralizations of power</p>
<p begin="03:20:23.680" end="03:20:29.439" style="s2">themselves may agree with that</p>
<p begin="03:20:26.399" end="03:20:31.760" style="s2">all right like even the</p>
<p begin="03:20:29.439" end="03:20:31.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="03:20:33.600" end="03:20:36.720" style="s2">i think i think mark zuckerberg went</p>
<p begin="03:20:35.120" end="03:20:37.680" style="s2">before congress and said look please</p>
<p begin="03:20:36.720" end="03:20:38.960" style="s2">regulate us right</p>
<p begin="03:20:37.680" end="03:20:40.479" style="s2">you want me to regulate speech on the</p>
<p begin="03:20:38.960" end="03:20:42.239" style="s2">platform you know tell me how to do it</p>
<p begin="03:20:40.479" end="03:20:46.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll do it right</p>
<p begin="03:20:42.239" end="03:20:50.800" style="s2">uh like once there is somebody to</p>
<p begin="03:20:46.720" end="03:20:52.920" style="s2">to to to blame it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="03:20:50.800" end="03:20:54.960" style="s2">you know it becomes almost their</p>
<p begin="03:20:52.920" end="03:20:56.800" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="03:20:54.960" end="03:20:58.319" style="s2">so decentralized stuff doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="03:20:56.800" end="03:21:02.160" style="s2">seem to have</p>
<p begin="03:20:58.319" end="03:21:06.080" style="s2">this problem or put it this way</p>
<p begin="03:21:02.160" end="03:21:09.840" style="s2">it is much easier for people to accept</p>
<p begin="03:21:06.080" end="03:21:11.359" style="s2">dying from cancer than dying from murder</p>
<p begin="03:21:09.840" end="03:21:12.160" style="s2">because you can kind of accept death</p>
<p begin="03:21:11.359" end="03:21:14.319" style="s2">from cancer</p>
<p begin="03:21:12.160" end="03:21:15.920" style="s2">stoically maybe not so much anymore if</p>
<p begin="03:21:14.319" end="03:21:17.279" style="s2">you believe in a treatment but at least</p>
<p begin="03:21:15.920" end="03:21:19.040" style="s2">historically when people would get</p>
<p begin="03:21:17.279" end="03:21:22.640" style="s2">cancer it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="03:21:19.040" end="03:21:25.120" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s my time</p>
<p begin="03:21:22.640" end="03:21:26.720" style="s2">and god chose this for me it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="03:21:25.120" end="03:21:31.120" style="s2">easier thing to accept</p>
<p begin="03:21:26.720" end="03:21:39.840" style="s2">than um well</p>
<p begin="03:21:31.120" end="03:21:39.840" style="s2">being murdered</p>
<p begin="03:21:45.200" end="03:21:50.000" style="s2">genuine decentralization doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="03:21:46.880" end="03:21:51.120" style="s2">reliable is this a technical problem</p>
<p begin="03:21:50.000" end="03:21:52.880" style="s2">could certainly build a reliable</p>
<p begin="03:21:51.120" end="03:21:53.520" style="s2">decentralized twitter wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="03:21:52.880" end="03:21:56.319" style="s2">hacked like</p>
<p begin="03:21:53.520" end="03:21:56.319" style="s2">central estuary</p>
<p begin="03:21:58.479" end="03:22:02.319" style="s2">centralization&#39;s not necessarily part of</p>
<p begin="03:22:00.560" end="03:22:06.720" style="s2">the capitalist game</p>
<p begin="03:22:02.319" end="03:22:09.439" style="s2">um maybe in a world where</p>
<p begin="03:22:06.720" end="03:22:11.200" style="s2">money has influence in politics it does</p>
<p begin="03:22:09.439" end="03:22:11.920" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think capitalism in general</p>
<p begin="03:22:11.200" end="03:22:14.880" style="s2">is pro</p>
<p begin="03:22:11.920" end="03:22:15.840" style="s2">centralization or decentralization uh</p>
<p begin="03:22:14.880" end="03:22:19.600" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="03:22:15.840" end="03:22:21.439" style="s2">the way that you make money is um</p>
<p begin="03:22:19.600" end="03:22:22.880" style="s2">you know you build something for</p>
<p begin="03:22:21.439" end="03:22:23.920" style="s2">everybody right you build something that</p>
<p begin="03:22:22.880" end="03:22:27.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to sell to millions of</p>
<p begin="03:22:23.920" end="03:22:27.200" style="s2">people i guess this is still kind of</p>
<p begin="03:22:32.840" end="03:22:37.760" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="03:22:34.880" end="03:22:37.760" style="s2">am i vegan no</p>

<p begin="03:23:07.200" end="03:23:09.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="03:23:09.439" end="03:23:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not as good right and i think</p>
<p begin="03:23:15.279" end="03:23:18.319" style="s2">how about this and we could talk about</p>
<p begin="03:23:16.880" end="03:23:19.439" style="s2">drug addiction under the same lens of</p>
<p begin="03:23:18.319" end="03:23:22.640" style="s2">social media addiction</p>
<p begin="03:23:19.439" end="03:23:26.479" style="s2">right if if somebody made</p>

<p begin="03:23:30.479" end="03:23:34.000" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="03:23:35.760" end="03:23:38.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not addictive let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="03:23:37.200" end="03:23:39.920" style="s2">all right like it&#39;s a simple change we</p>
<p begin="03:23:38.880" end="03:23:41.520" style="s2">could make to heroin</p>
<p begin="03:23:39.920" end="03:23:43.439" style="s2">we could take heroin and we could make</p>
<p begin="03:23:41.520" end="03:23:44.640" style="s2">non-addictive hair right and how you</p>
<p begin="03:23:43.439" end="03:23:46.239" style="s2">actually do that let&#39;s assume it&#39;s</p>
