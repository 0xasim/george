<p begin="00:45:31.930" end="00:45:35.770" style="s2">there&#39;s that definition and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.180" end="00:45:38.529" style="s2">definition of the obsolescence of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.770" end="00:45:41.819" style="s2">humanity which is computers are capable</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.529" end="00:45:41.819" style="s2">of doing every job</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:47.460" style="s2">you have to talk about which definition</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.930" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about and what you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.460" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">to know</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.890" end="00:45:59.130" style="s2">probably yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.390" end="00:46:01.820" style="s2">this is they banned people from riding</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.130" end="00:46:01.820" style="s2">horses on the slope</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.340" end="00:46:09.410" style="s2">now you need clothes courses right just</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.080" end="00:46:09.410" style="s2">like cars</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.730" end="00:46:27.510" style="s2">people with us all the way to looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.490" end="00:46:31.790" style="s2">awesome I cast yet something</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.510" end="00:46:31.790" style="s2">look that one do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.580" end="00:46:42.030" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m so working with the OEMs is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.430" end="00:46:45.290" style="s2">incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.030" end="00:46:45.290" style="s2">our structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.560" end="00:46:51.420" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that is the effort all</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.770" end="00:46:53.940" style="s2">I think you have to think about how else</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.420" end="00:46:56.460" style="s2">I think entering at the dealership level</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.940" end="00:46:58.920" style="s2">might be the appropriate sort of place</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.460" end="00:47:02.130" style="s2">with the arteries where the dealer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.920" end="00:47:04.529" style="s2">perception of that idea they enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.130" end="00:47:05.940" style="s2">they liked the idea obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.529" end="00:47:12.109" style="s2">wanted to be more consumer on this</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.940" end="00:47:12.109" style="s2">course but that probably is the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.589" end="00:47:18.150" style="s2">does this approach women</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.900" end="00:47:26.019" style="s2">here&#39;s a question wall of wind right</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:27.730" style="s2">just the other approaches are in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.019" end="00:47:29.559" style="s2">ways more predictable if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.730" end="00:47:32.349" style="s2">about the build a car and ship a car</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.559" end="00:47:35.259" style="s2">approach the fastest company from</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.349" end="00:47:37.630" style="s2">inception to shipping a standard</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.259" end="00:47:41.349" style="s2">production vehicle I think was Tesla I</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.630" end="00:47:42.910" style="s2">think it took them seven years so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.349" end="00:47:45.549" style="s2">how long it would take a company if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.910" end="00:47:47.499" style="s2">started today to build a car maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.549" end="00:47:50.799" style="s2">a little bit easier with electric maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.499" end="00:47:54.069" style="s2">they can do it in four or five but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.799" end="00:47:55.869" style="s2">still a huge challenge so if companies</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.069" end="00:47:58.089" style="s2">start today or started last year it</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.869" end="00:48:01.269" style="s2">started two years ago I think we beat</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.089" end="00:48:02.740" style="s2">them if they&#39;re trying to build cars now</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.269" end="00:48:06.099" style="s2">then there&#39;s companies who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.740" end="00:48:07.990" style="s2">work with OEMs so you look at like Volvo</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.099" end="00:48:09.490" style="s2">have these drive pilot program that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.990" end="00:48:12.579" style="s2">were planning to make you this year</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.490" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">they&#39;ve pushed it back to 2021 which</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.579" end="00:48:17.020" style="s2">seems to be that date that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:20.380" style="s2">these car manufacturers are saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.020" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">again I think we win like but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.380" end="00:48:22.360" style="s2">mean I feel they solve the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:24.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:26.530" style="s2">the truth is most people that will ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.760" end="00:48:29.230" style="s2">me questions about like does the public</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.530" end="00:48:32.260" style="s2">perception of these systems matter and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.230" end="00:48:36.040" style="s2">in reality public perception is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.260" end="00:48:38.950" style="s2">lagging indicator of quality if you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.040" end="00:48:41.080" style="s2">good quality somehow our society is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.950" end="00:48:43.390" style="s2">fairly efficient at disseminating</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.080" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">information if you have bad quality the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.390" end="00:48:49.090" style="s2">same thing applies step one</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:51.160" style="s2">build a good system do you have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.090" end="00:48:53.420" style="s2">the problem and I think it&#39;s solved</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.160" end="00:48:55.940" style="s2">maybe two or three years</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.420" end="00:48:57.890" style="s2">that beats out anybody really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.940" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">work with OEMs if you believe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.890" end="00:49:03.140" style="s2">2021 and anybody trying to build their</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">own car then there&#39;s this third approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.140" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">the third approach is maybe the way Moe</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:11.450" style="s2">of approach where they&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">self-driving with a building right share</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.450" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">networks</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:17.390" style="s2">the thing about ride-sharing networks is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:20.359" style="s2">you have to operate super unprofitably</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.390" end="00:49:23.540" style="s2">until the minute you solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.359" end="00:49:26.420" style="s2">now if solving the problem were very</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.540" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">very very predictable but we knew due to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.420" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">some kind of you know inexorable law</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:34.010" style="s2">that the problem would be solved by 2020</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:36.920" style="s2">and exactly what sensors in compute</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.010" end="00:49:38.750" style="s2">would be required if we knew that then</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.920" end="00:49:41.930" style="s2">the ride-sharing approach would probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.750" end="00:49:43.790" style="s2">win because if we knew that best fit</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.930" end="00:49:45.650" style="s2">would be easy the world could get</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.790" end="00:49:48.619" style="s2">together multiple trillion dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.650" end="00:49:50.540" style="s2">build out the entire network subsidize</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.619" end="00:49:53.390" style="s2">it do it all with human drivers and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.540" end="00:49:58.480" style="s2">2020 you flip the switch but because of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.390" end="00:50:00.770" style="s2">that uncertainty scene I tend to believe</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.480" end="00:50:03.310" style="s2">about that long</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.770" end="00:50:03.310" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.210" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">salt is important</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">can we get an MTV Cribs</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.109" end="00:50:21.809" style="s2">hey if you know someone at MTV Cribs</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:21.809" style="s2">yeah what which level so</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.000" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really like the levels are</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:31.160" style="s2">stupid I guess I am talking about level</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:34.100" style="s2">4 the levels are really just a liability</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.160" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">question it&#39;s like oh the Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.100" end="00:50:38.330" style="s2">thing where it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:39.830" style="s2">pornography right it&#39;s hard to define</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.330" end="00:50:41.360" style="s2">but you&#39;ll know it when you see it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.830" end="00:50:43.050" style="s2">the same thing kind of what self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.360" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">system is right</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.050" end="00:50:47.580" style="s2">you&#39;ll know it when it&#39;s solved he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:49.880" style="s2">type in a destination it&#39;ll go there and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.580" end="00:50:51.870" style="s2">it&#39;s highly unlikely to make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.880" end="00:50:53.880" style="s2">better than you try it statistically</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.870" end="00:50:56.420" style="s2">better than humans so I guess that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.880" end="00:50:56.420" style="s2">level 4</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:01.140" style="s2">the levels are kind of off</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.580" end="00:51:06.380" style="s2">it&#39;s all about the number two</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.930" end="00:51:06.380" style="s2">significance</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.190" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">after 75</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.750" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">one way road trip</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.840" end="00:51:25.490" style="s2">all right so what car should we buy for</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:28.320" style="s2">next year self-driving car later in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.490" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">sponsored by sponsored by silver car Oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.320" end="00:51:35.460" style="s2">silver car might actually sponsor nope</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:37.650" style="s2">notice that we were definitely on lease</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.460" end="00:51:40.380" style="s2">you&#39;d have to pay me to drive across the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.650" end="00:51:42.060" style="s2">country to Subaru attend again I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.380" end="00:51:45.290" style="s2">anti shelling I don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.060" end="00:51:47.880" style="s2">anything wrong with Subaru WRX as a nice</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.290" end="00:51:51.390" style="s2">no way I&#39;m taking a Lambo to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.880" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">places we went while the Lambo and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.390" end="00:52:01.550" style="s2">snow and ice and stuff say fours are</p>

<p begin="00:52:02.890" end="00:52:06.970" style="s2">we could definitely work definiteiy a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.630" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">different route next year but yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.970" end="00:52:11.130" style="s2">gonna do the same sort of thing drive</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:11.130" style="s2">across the country</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.430" end="00:52:15.480" style="s2">that&#39;s sponsored I mean no no no I</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.410" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">predict I predict a big things for combo</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.480" end="00:52:21.559" style="s2">look at how much has changed me here one</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:21.559" style="s2">year ago we had</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.820" end="00:52:27.510" style="s2">barely even to be honest I think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.150" end="00:52:30.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t start to get people until January</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.510" end="00:52:33.400" style="s2">we had open pilot 0.1 was really</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.790" end="00:52:36.180" style="s2">unusable it would crash every couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.400" end="00:52:41.650" style="s2">minutes like just software would crash</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.180" end="00:52:43.360" style="s2">the neo was was was janky they were kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.650" end="00:52:46.270" style="s2">of hard to get her to get that board</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.360" end="00:52:48.220" style="s2">made I used to have to like step or get</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.270" end="00:52:51.730" style="s2">up like by the court and by the cables</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.220" end="00:52:53.830" style="s2">on itself this cable was a hazard what</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:58.140" style="s2">we saw this year we saw a neo driven we</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.830" end="00:52:58.140" style="s2">saw la timer felt the board&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.910" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know across the</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.750" end="00:54:41.370" style="s2">we have to check I&#39;m not really sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.110" end="00:54:43.830" style="s2">whether the front-facing camera can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.370" end="00:54:46.410" style="s2">you or not it&#39;s gonna be you pops we</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.780" end="00:54:55.670" style="s2">camera yeah slam on the brakes</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:00.520" style="s2">well as hard as it can so we would</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">decelerate with 0.3 G of breaking and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.520" end="00:55:05.819" style="s2">then I would press the brakes even</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:05.819" style="s2">harder get up to 1g</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.220" end="00:55:12.170" style="s2">breaking is almost always safer than</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.500" end="00:55:14.510" style="s2">swerving breaking is almost always the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.170" end="00:55:18.500" style="s2">right choice much for a really confident</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.510" end="00:55:20.900" style="s2">miss or well like he&#39;s just swerving</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.500" end="00:55:22.040" style="s2">like around like our car that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.900" end="00:55:24.670" style="s2">is not going to move is fine but</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.040" end="00:55:27.110" style="s2">swerving around deer in the breaks you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.670" end="00:55:30.140" style="s2">sort of try to predict the deers motion</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.110" end="00:55:31.310" style="s2">you end up hitting him yeah without</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.140" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">animals braking is the right choice</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.310" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.770" end="00:55:43.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a black cat he can&#39;t stop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.720" end="00:55:44.910" style="s2">why then we hit the black cat hoping</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.410" end="00:55:50.300" style="s2">pilot won&#39;t slam on the brakes for a cat</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.910" end="00:55:50.300" style="s2">sorry John neither would you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.049" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.870" end="00:56:02.580" style="s2">so I mean what you really wanna do is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.750" end="00:56:04.440" style="s2">like if minimum wage laws increase do</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.580" end="00:56:06.930" style="s2">you see in areas where minimum wage laws</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.440" end="00:56:09.150" style="s2">are kind of high like in Europe or in</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.930" end="00:56:11.220" style="s2">California they&#39;ll see that McDonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.150" end="00:56:14.130" style="s2">has replaced a lot of the ordering with</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.220" end="00:56:16.800" style="s2">those computer screens right so minimum</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.130" end="00:56:19.890" style="s2">increased minimum wage will expedite the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.800" end="00:56:21.509" style="s2">replacement of humans with machines</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.890" end="00:56:24.950" style="s2">why are their employees of fast food</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.509" end="00:56:26.910" style="s2">restaurants probably cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.950" end="00:56:29.070" style="s2">some of those things are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.910" end="00:56:32.730" style="s2">anything where you have to like use your</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.070" end="00:56:37.940" style="s2">hand and complex ways robotics isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.730" end="00:56:37.940" style="s2">quite there use such as complet</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.200" end="00:56:44.750" style="s2">multitasked yeah well it&#39;s hard to like</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.740" end="00:56:46.789" style="s2">it&#39;s also much harder to train a robot</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.750" end="00:56:50.119" style="s2">than to train a person</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.789" end="00:56:52.099" style="s2">I&#39;m error recovery is tricky you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.119" end="00:56:53.509" style="s2">probably do it no and you don&#39;t whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.099" end="00:56:55.160" style="s2">you&#39;d also have to look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.509" end="00:56:57.739" style="s2">breakdown of operating fast-food</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.160" end="00:56:59.880" style="s2">franchises how much of the cost is human</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.739" end="00:57:02.520" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.880" end="00:57:05.630" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.520" end="00:57:08.490" style="s2">yeah well yeah so that&#39;s the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.630" end="00:57:11.730" style="s2">you can you can slam and steer now again</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.490" end="00:57:13.560" style="s2">your car still has traction you have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.730" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">ask the question of you know started</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.560" end="00:57:16.590" style="s2">racing a little bit you have to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:17.190" style="s2">question of where you want to use your</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.590" end="00:57:18.660" style="s2">grip</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.190" end="00:57:19.830" style="s2">do you want to use your grip to brake</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.660" end="00:57:22.770" style="s2">and steer or do you want to use your</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.830" end="00:57:25.860" style="s2">grip to try to do both both is almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.770" end="00:57:28.050" style="s2">always the worst choice right because</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.860" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">they are getting less braking like sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.050" end="00:57:31.320" style="s2">you can brake and steer but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:34.320" style="s2">getting less braking if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.320" end="00:57:36.920" style="s2">steal now using some of your friction in</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.320" end="00:57:36.920" style="s2">order to steam</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.090" end="00:57:52.859" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.819" end="00:57:54.719" style="s2">yeah well that depends on your traction</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.859" end="00:57:55.499" style="s2">control system the one in this car is</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.719" end="00:57:57.989" style="s2">really good</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.499" end="00:57:59.910" style="s2">I had a Nissan 350z I used to ride</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.989" end="00:58:02.849" style="s2">around Rochester that traction control</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.910" end="00:58:06.900" style="s2">system was terrible obviously to that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.849" end="00:58:08.519" style="s2">early 2000 it was a 2008 and it would</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.900" end="00:58:11.099" style="s2">get which it would increase the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.519" end="00:58:13.019" style="s2">oscillations and wouldn&#39;t dampen who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.099" end="00:58:15.499" style="s2">really poorly done this one is this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.019" end="00:58:15.499" style="s2">so much better</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.770" end="00:58:21.430" style="s2">see I mean yeah bad ones do that good</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.410" end="00:58:23.140" style="s2">ones ones don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.430" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">I love something related to the Festiva</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.140" end="00:58:27.060" style="s2">thing it&#39;s so crazy that like they get a</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.679" end="01:15:16.659" style="s2">when you look at a CPU die and when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.710" end="01:15:19.370" style="s2">look at how many so so so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.659" end="01:15:21.140" style="s2">multiplied accumulates right multiply</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.370" end="01:15:25.100" style="s2">two numbers and like accumulates that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.140" end="01:15:26.540" style="s2">the basic kind of DSP operation that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.100" end="01:15:30.590" style="s2">need for a matrix multiplication which</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.540" end="01:15:32.659" style="s2">is what neural networks are you look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.590" end="01:15:34.040" style="s2">the CPUs die and you realize really only</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.659" end="01:15:35.870" style="s2">like two or three percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.040" end="01:15:38.989" style="s2">transistors are dedicated to doing this</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.870" end="01:15:41.239" style="s2">so there&#39;s clearly a room for a 30%</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.989" end="01:15:43.210" style="s2">improvement right at the same process</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.239" end="01:15:46.489" style="s2">size in the same power</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.210" end="01:15:49.640" style="s2">so using CPUs for neural network sucks</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.489" end="01:15:52.400" style="s2">or bad idea when we look at a GPUs die</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.640" end="01:15:56.030" style="s2">you see that like sixty percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.400" end="01:15:58.160" style="s2">GPU already has the transistors kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.030" end="01:16:01.940" style="s2">where you want</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.160" end="01:16:04.200" style="s2">now you can do things like pipelining</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.940" end="01:16:05.580" style="s2">veteran dedicated hardware than you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.200" end="01:16:09.270" style="s2">on GPU</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.580" end="01:16:12.660" style="s2">but it&#39;s not gonna be a 10x improvement</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.270" end="01:16:14.040" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a two or three exit the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.660" end="01:16:15.330" style="s2">truth is that&#39;s the kind of improvement</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.040" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">you could get some soft breath</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.330" end="01:16:22.170" style="s2">so I&#39;m bearish I&#39;m dedicated they had</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.280" end="01:16:22.890" style="s2">chipsets and I&#39;m bullish on GPU DSPs and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.170" end="01:16:25.299" style="s2">things that are a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.890" end="01:16:26.949" style="s2">general-purpose</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.299" end="01:16:29.090" style="s2">because yeah because a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.949" end="01:16:31.340" style="s2">transistors for anything</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.090" end="01:16:34.600" style="s2">for the purpose you would use them</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.340" end="01:16:34.600" style="s2">Florida dedicated chips in any way</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.939" end="01:16:39.480" style="s2">honestly I really want to stick with</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:40.980" style="s2">smartphone hardware for as long as I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.480" end="01:16:43.530" style="s2">well next year&#39;s thing to be based</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.980" end="01:16:46.250" style="s2">around a smartphone maybe see see how</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.530" end="01:16:46.250" style="s2">things shake up this here</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.739" end="01:16:53.940" style="s2">oh that&#39;s not so we&#39;re never gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.369" end="01:16:55.560" style="s2">policy in the back</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.940" end="01:16:57.470" style="s2">you&#39;re like cruising waiting opening</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.560" end="01:17:00.410" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.470" end="01:17:02.280" style="s2">and like at some point it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.410" end="01:17:04.110" style="s2">matter right</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.280" end="01:17:06.060" style="s2">also the people think that there are</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.110" end="01:17:08.160" style="s2">regulatory barriers to level 4 there</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.060" end="01:17:10.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t some states you can already put</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.160" end="01:17:13.030" style="s2">your car on the road</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.000" end="01:17:14.380" style="s2">no people it&#39;s just fine I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.030" end="01:17:15.670" style="s2">liability question right obviously</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.380" end="01:17:17.860" style="s2">you&#39;re liable then for what that car</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.670" end="01:17:20.980" style="s2">does there&#39;s no driver in the car detect</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.860" end="01:17:23.410" style="s2">liability there&#39;s very little advantage</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.980" end="01:17:25.360" style="s2">to do against state by state</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.410" end="01:17:28.180" style="s2">there might be an advantage to doing it</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.360" end="01:17:34.470" style="s2">Road type by row type but then that kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.180" end="01:17:38.410" style="s2">of isn&#39;t level for its level three you</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.470" end="01:17:39.930" style="s2">banned low quality users we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.410" end="01:17:43.930" style="s2">discriminate whether their community</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.930" end="01:17:46.930" style="s2">repetition Boulder yeah well yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.930" end="01:17:51.820" style="s2">guess fine right funny really funny you</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.930" end="01:17:55.060" style="s2">gotta be fun really calm and don&#39;t rid</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.820" end="01:17:58.960" style="s2">of that crap this isn&#39;t even anti</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.060" end="01:18:01.630" style="s2">shelling so many sucks I don&#39;t know just</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.960" end="01:18:03.410" style="s2">like kind of it you know what not even</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.630" end="01:18:05.610" style="s2">gonna be nice to something</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.410" end="01:18:08.070" style="s2">I&#39;m not allowed to discuss my settlement</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.610" end="01:18:09.620" style="s2">meeting but I am allowed to discuss the</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.070" end="01:18:14.010" style="s2">meeting we had after the settlement</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.620" end="01:18:15.300" style="s2">where I met with some engineers and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.010" end="01:18:16.440" style="s2">they were gonna be lawyers they wanted</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.300" end="01:18:17.640" style="s2">me to tell me how they did it they</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.440" end="01:18:19.500" style="s2">really wanted me to like do free</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.640" end="01:18:22.650" style="s2">security testing on the PlayStation for</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.500" end="01:18:24.060" style="s2">them happy to talk about it to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.650" end="01:18:25.320" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re engineers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.060" end="01:18:26.469" style="s2">like the guys who built the security</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.320" end="01:18:28.300" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.469" end="01:18:31.239" style="s2">no after you solve a puzzle it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:33.690" style="s2">fun to talk with the guy who wrote the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.239" end="01:18:33.690" style="s2">puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.989" end="01:18:39.450" style="s2">so ya know I went to a room and uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.790" end="01:18:42.180" style="s2">they&#39;re engineers we just don&#39;t we just</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.450" end="01:18:43.770" style="s2">gotta talked about all PlayStation</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.180" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.770" end="01:18:47.869" style="s2">stakes how things could have done</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:49.800" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.869" end="01:18:51.960" style="s2">right on everything</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.800" end="01:18:53.760" style="s2">no lawyers I don&#39;t know and I really</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.960" end="01:18:55.170" style="s2">don&#39;t like lawyers like the lawyer way</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.760" end="01:18:56.940" style="s2">of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.170" end="01:18:58.830" style="s2">the lawyer way of thinking is asking the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.940" end="01:19:00.550" style="s2">question what can&#39;t you do not what can</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.830" end="01:19:03.540" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.550" end="01:19:03.540" style="s2">laughter most</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.750" end="01:19:11.810" style="s2">this is really the last periscope guys</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.500" end="01:19:11.810" style="s2">we don&#39;t be more next year my clean</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.849" end="01:19:19.739" style="s2">the more rejection I feel like this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:23.510" style="s2">the last one yeah tomorrow tomorrow we</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.739" end="01:19:23.510" style="s2">take the letters off of the car</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.019" end="01:19:32.429" style="s2">our tomorrow&#39;s the truth Commodus 37</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.099" end="01:19:36.329" style="s2">just 37 yeah that you saw comma no but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.429" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">mean look grow next year we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.329" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:46.719" style="s2">that&#39;s better yep</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.090" end="01:19:49.480" style="s2">, Maps</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.719" end="01:19:52.780" style="s2">we&#39;re working on him working on him a</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.480" end="01:19:55.239" style="s2">lot on the the upstairs team working on</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.780" end="01:19:58.870" style="s2">localization and mapping we have an</p>

<p begin="01:19:58.870" end="01:20:04.510" style="s2">them they&#39;re accurate to about a meter</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.050" end="01:20:07.630" style="s2">right now we want to get that accuracy</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.510" end="01:20:09.460" style="s2">down to 10 centimeters open-source as</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.630" end="01:20:11.870" style="s2">much as we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.460" end="01:20:13.610" style="s2">so this is my warning to all the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.870" end="01:20:15.270" style="s2">companies out there planning to erect a</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.610" end="01:20:17.430" style="s2">seat by holding a bath</p>

<p begin="01:20:22.889" end="01:20:28.409" style="s2">and building a map with like a dedicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.290" end="01:20:29.159" style="s2">fleet of mapping cars we are going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.409" end="01:20:30.900" style="s2">disrupt it</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.159" end="01:20:33.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t even mean this like an</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.900" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">aggressive way I mean this a taillight</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.110" end="01:20:41.130" style="s2">no don&#39;t be you don&#39;t end up like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:43.320" style="s2">if you can&#39;t figure out a way to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.130" end="01:20:49.110" style="s2">profit off of the mapping operation</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.320" end="01:20:53.929" style="s2">itself you&#39;re going to lose we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.110" end="01:20:56.940" style="s2">profiting that they have some other yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.929" end="01:20:59.969" style="s2">right source of other source of income</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.940" end="01:21:02.610" style="s2">right um I mean it&#39;s possible for things</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.969" end="01:21:04.230" style="s2">like Avery to succeed where at least</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.610" end="01:21:06.929" style="s2">you&#39;re crowdsourcing it even if you are</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.230" end="01:21:10.469" style="s2">paying the users yeah but we believe in</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.929" end="01:21:13.739" style="s2">paying the users the value we add value</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.469" end="01:21:16.909" style="s2">with the dash cam sometimes I think we</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.739" end="01:21:16.909" style="s2">add a lot of value with a pilot</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.060" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">all the updated maps are super data that</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.920" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">super broke that server broke there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:27.010" style="s2">incentive to fix that um what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:28.510" style="s2">doing Maps much more regionally now</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.010" end="01:21:30.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make the maps like</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.510" end="01:21:31.989" style="s2">really good in one region and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.640" end="01:21:35.469" style="s2">get a probably open source like that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.989" end="01:21:36.670" style="s2">region we have lane signs and curves and</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.469" end="01:21:39.180" style="s2">they&#39;ll all be accurate to like 10</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.670" end="01:21:39.180" style="s2">centimeters</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.789" end="01:21:49.019" style="s2">ah I think I mean we think of Schiffer</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.699" end="01:21:50.760" style="s2">the way we think of Schiffer in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.019" end="01:21:53.460" style="s2">coming years Schiffer is like the remote</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.760" end="01:21:56.280" style="s2">control for their car especially if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.460" end="01:21:59.190" style="s2">have any on mountain and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.280" end="01:22:01.290" style="s2">yeah a future we picture is something</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.190" end="01:22:04.370" style="s2">like your friend text you the location</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.290" end="01:22:04.370" style="s2">of the dress</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.719" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">say like forward do shiver to my comedy</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.480" end="01:22:12.940" style="s2">on it&#39;ll show up and wheeze yeah you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.940" end="01:27:51.810" style="s2">on all about like how you train them</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.429" end="01:27:53.340" style="s2">nets are a very powerful idea</p>

<p begin="01:27:57.420" end="01:28:01.440" style="s2">I think we&#39;ll find better ways to train</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.010" end="01:28:03.720" style="s2">them I think better learning is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.440" end="01:28:05.430" style="s2">a huge field fishing learning but we</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.720" end="01:28:08.370" style="s2">still use optimizers like if using</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.430" end="01:28:10.140" style="s2">stochastic gradient descent there is no</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.370" end="01:28:12.720" style="s2">metal learning you talk about momentum</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.140" end="01:28:15.060" style="s2">as meta learning but that&#39;s still very</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.720" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">very crude right what if you could learn</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.060" end="01:28:18.840" style="s2">what your future weight updates would</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:21.670" style="s2">would look like you can build predictive</p>

<p begin="01:39:03.050" end="01:39:09.280" style="s2">feel like the interior and the ride</p>

<p begin="01:39:22.630" end="01:39:27.699" style="s2">like the acceleration I really like the</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.790" end="01:39:28.330" style="s2">responsiveness you know what kills me we</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.699" end="01:39:30.730" style="s2">rent it out</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.330" end="01:39:33.489" style="s2">we rented a Chevy Volt and they</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.730" end="01:39:37.000" style="s2">literally delay the acceleration to try</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.489" end="01:39:39.040" style="s2">to mimic a gasoline car you have so much</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.000" end="01:39:41.489" style="s2">more power available to you in that</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.040" end="01:39:44.140" style="s2">motor you deliberately make it black</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.489" end="01:39:46.690" style="s2">it&#39;s disgusting I mean it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.140" end="01:39:48.699" style="s2">explanation I have if that explanation</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.690" end="01:39:50.350" style="s2">is wrong I would love to know but that</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.699" end="01:39:51.850" style="s2">is certainly what it feels like but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.350" end="01:39:53.679" style="s2">they certainly have this thing electric</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.850" end="01:39:56.770" style="s2">cars called creep right right does they</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.679" end="01:40:00.820" style="s2">get turned on give it to em City right</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.770" end="01:40:03.670" style="s2">yeah dead zone let&#39;s tell them what we</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.820" end="01:40:13.660" style="s2">really think about them we love you</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.670" end="01:40:17.429" style="s2">scobie&#39;s even if you can&#39;t go peas our</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.660" end="01:40:17.429" style="s2">belly bag probably like</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.630" end="01:40:31.050" style="s2">No okay good now if you&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.590" end="01:40:32.730" style="s2">safely the truth is good safe driving</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.050" end="01:40:35.120" style="s2">all cars can kind of be treated as a</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.730" end="01:40:35.120" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.059" end="01:40:40.179" style="s2">our limits are steering torque limits</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.860" end="01:40:42.400" style="s2">are breaking them it&#39;s our acceleration</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.179" end="01:40:45.510" style="s2">limits are well within what any</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.400" end="01:40:45.510" style="s2">production car begin</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.470" end="01:40:59.190" style="s2">leave them in exit 2</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.290" end="01:41:05.170" style="s2">it&#39;s exit 2 in the new stage it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.560" end="01:41:08.550" style="s2">the exits are going that way that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.170" end="01:41:08.550" style="s2">I say standard for that</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.330" end="01:41:14.730" style="s2">I guess they restart this thing we saw</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.720" end="01:41:15.990" style="s2">that though anywhere else no we did I</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.730" end="01:41:17.610" style="s2">think they only restart when they change</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.990" end="01:41:19.350" style="s2">the name of the fireman no no they</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.610" end="01:41:20.790" style="s2">definitely restart to stay indefinitely</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.350" end="01:41:22.590" style="s2">we start this tape the only question is</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.790" end="01:41:24.570" style="s2">are they going up are they going down I</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.590" end="01:41:29.880" style="s2">guess they start going up again well</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.570" end="01:41:31.920" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re quite high 500 we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.880" end="01:41:34.470" style="s2">enough attention to see if that was true</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.920" end="01:41:36.300" style="s2">all throughout the states but yeah they</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.470" end="01:41:38.040" style="s2">do run into an interesting problem where</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.300" end="01:41:40.590" style="s2">if like you have one that&#39;s descending</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.040" end="01:41:42.690" style="s2">one the day seven you have to exit tubes</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.590" end="01:41:48.450" style="s2">actually pretty close to each others</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.690" end="01:41:51.450" style="s2">just in different states interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.450" end="01:41:53.220" style="s2">state coordination I bet you members of</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.450" end="01:41:54.710" style="s2">state legislatures have spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.220" end="01:41:57.880" style="s2">time discussing</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.710" end="01:41:57.880" style="s2">well these are all federal</p>
