<p begin="00:00:04.069" end="00:00:19.370" style="s2">periscope three people we have one</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.399" end="00:00:28.610" style="s2">person we have one person two people the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.370" end="00:00:31.130" style="s2">Tesla says all right so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.610" end="00:00:33.740" style="s2">should kind of go through this all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.130" end="00:00:36.830" style="s2">because this is kind of a lot of what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.740" end="00:00:39.470" style="s2">see is wrong with how modern companies</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.830" end="00:00:43.900" style="s2">communicate I&#39;m so changing the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.470" end="00:00:46.550" style="s2">with with AV that&#39;s all great this guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.900" end="00:00:50.530" style="s2">then you have a big a big a big</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.550" end="00:00:58.850" style="s2">statement cautionary note on</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.530" end="00:01:00.470" style="s2">forward-looking statements basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.850" end="00:01:03.320" style="s2">it&#39;s saying like we can&#39;t predict the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.470" end="00:01:08.299" style="s2">future right so this is this is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.320" end="00:01:11.389" style="s2">thing one no right this is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.299" end="00:01:12.979" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have to be a thing I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.389" end="00:01:14.299" style="s2">sure what kind of world we live in where</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.979" end="00:01:19.689" style="s2">it&#39;s like you have to make a claim that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.299" end="00:01:19.689" style="s2">we cannot predict them but let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.229" end="00:01:23.899" style="s2">GM&#39;s world you know I&#39;m not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.340" end="00:01:25.069" style="s2">able to do this that well because I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.899" end="00:01:27.740" style="s2">just I was just talking about it with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.069" end="00:01:33.469" style="s2">Vivian and like why something like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.740" end="00:01:34.759" style="s2">is absurd so you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.469" end="00:01:37.689" style="s2">something like the trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.759" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">socialism and libertarianism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.689" end="00:01:42.590" style="s2">arguments to be made on both sides right</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.420" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">if you have like a trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.590" end="00:01:48.020" style="s2">cameras and lidar there&#39;s arguments to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.639" style="s2">be made on both sides and you could have</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.020" end="00:01:50.990" style="s2">a camera you could have a company that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.639" end="00:01:52.189" style="s2">committed to cameras are committed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.990" end="00:01:55.490" style="s2">light our committed to socialism</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.189" end="00:01:59.060" style="s2">committed to libertarianism but in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.490" end="00:02:00.709" style="s2">for that to like make any sense you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.060" end="00:02:02.270" style="s2">to have like a reasonable not like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.709" end="00:02:03.859" style="s2">like a really stupid straw man you would</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.270" end="00:02:05.779" style="s2">need I&#39;m gonna go reasonable you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.859" end="00:02:08.030" style="s2">thing that you are in order for you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.779" end="00:02:09.500" style="s2">be saying anything you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.030" end="00:02:11.600" style="s2">to reasonably imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.500" end="00:02:14.600" style="s2">somebody&#39;s saying the opposite right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.600" end="00:02:18.620" style="s2">let&#39;s look at these things zero crashes</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.600" end="00:02:20.600" style="s2">zero emission zero congestion so good</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.620" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">could you imagine somebody coming out in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.600" end="00:02:26.630" style="s2">favor of crashes good good boy could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:30.590" style="s2">imagine some company coming out saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.630" end="00:02:32.330" style="s2">well yeah like that&#39;s not a everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.590" end="00:02:33.530" style="s2">in engineering and this is Yuma shows</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.330" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">you that these people aren&#39;t engineers</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.530" end="00:02:38.690" style="s2">they don&#39;t think like engineers is about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">trade-offs right if you&#39;re designing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.690" end="00:02:44.810" style="s2">microprocessor you make a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">between say speed and power or you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.810" end="00:02:49.580" style="s2">make trade-offs between like reliability</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:52.010" style="s2">and cost engineering is all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.580" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">trade-offs I&#39;m not sure what this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.010" end="00:02:57.530" style="s2">right everybody who wants there to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">zero crashes but to say like gee I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.530" end="00:03:03.140" style="s2">worldview like this is actually a unique</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:07.400" style="s2">and distinctive worldview it&#39;s not this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:09.560" style="s2">says nothing zero emissions zero</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.400" end="00:03:11.330" style="s2">congestion nobody wants those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.560" end="00:03:14.390" style="s2">right even you might have some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.330" end="00:03:16.370" style="s2">who may not care about emissions but but</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.390" end="00:03:18.320" style="s2">they&#39;re not opposed to zero it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.370" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">something that like everybody knows is</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.320" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">better this is not this is saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.410" end="00:03:28.880" style="s2">nothing we are redefining the future of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">personal mobility right so you then go</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.880" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">through all of these things and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.590" end="00:03:34.670" style="s2">they&#39;re not these are all different</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">companies you talk about electric</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.670" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">vehicles maybe you have like Tesla&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:39.230" style="s2">leader you talk about autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:40.700" style="s2">vehicles maybe have way mostly there you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.230" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">talk about shared mobility maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.700" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">have Ober is the leader I&#39;m not okay but</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:50.360" style="s2">I read about it so these sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.769" end="00:03:52.220" style="s2">yeah committed to the future of strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.360" end="00:03:55.070" style="s2">cores the foundation for investing in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.220" end="00:03:58.459" style="s2">the future electrification um so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.070" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">another interesting thing that I noted</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.459" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">in here where they talk about Eevee is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">the foundation for autonomous vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:13.670" style="s2">up why because it supports our zero</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:16.640" style="s2">emissions future again your companies</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.670" end="00:04:17.959" style="s2">are not being led by engineers and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.640" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">is why you will lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.959" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">um you know or they say like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:28.350" style="s2">AV without Evie I mean of course there</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">is right look WAY Moe&#39;s doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.350" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">way most Pacifica they&#39;re hybrids but</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">autonomous vehicles are very different</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">from electric vehicles because if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:41.820" style="s2">had one autonomous vehicle it would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">incredibly useful just having you in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:46.890" style="s2">autonomous vehicle is useful having you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">in one electric vehicle is not that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.890" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">useful because you need infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:52.740" style="s2">to support it so sometimes I think to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:54.510" style="s2">say things very quickly like you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:04:57.570" style="s2">Evie is a shared infrastructure problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.510" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">but it is you don&#39;t need infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.570" end="00:05:00.780" style="s2">to support autonomous vehicles and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">important to notice all the people out</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.780" end="00:05:09.660" style="s2">there talking about like V to V and V to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:11.670" style="s2">I you actually need you you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.660" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">electric vehicles of course the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.670" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">thing that you need is is charging</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:16.950" style="s2">stations so unless you have quick</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:18.990" style="s2">charging stations like even if you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.950" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">a car that&#39;s capable of charging in five</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.990" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">when you look at how many megawatts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">power you&#39;d have to pump through the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:30.750" style="s2">thing but this isn&#39;t gonna be that long</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s see Lea my AV strategy right</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.750" end="00:05:35.850" style="s2">uh you know traffic fatalities are</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:40.290" style="s2">caused by human error everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.850" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">that parking okay we believe all a V&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:45.750" style="s2">must be V&#39;s on I have no idea why that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:48.510" style="s2">like are you making an argument here or</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.750" end="00:05:49.890" style="s2">these just like statements independent</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.510" end="00:05:53.430" style="s2">you know what else does this like TED</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.890" end="00:05:56.340" style="s2">Talks you ever see that like and when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.430" end="00:06:06.510" style="s2">press this button words will appear on</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.340" end="00:06:16.590" style="s2">the screen so let&#39;s see if they get into</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.510" end="00:06:23.040" style="s2">the technology Batman look at that lines</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.590" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">will go up bad lines will go down but</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.040" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">most lines will go up Oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.849" end="00:06:40.409" style="s2">okay first mover escape velocity your</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:43.659" style="s2">transportation service again um the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.409" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">transportation of the service I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.659" end="00:06:49.750" style="s2">really sure why autonomous vehicles make</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:51.729" style="s2">transportation as a service cheaper but</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.750" end="00:06:56.259" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure there is some truly</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.729" end="00:06:58.659" style="s2">critical threshold for it&#39;s the reason a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.259" end="00:07:00.879" style="s2">lot more people for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.659" end="00:07:02.530" style="s2">using uber would be cheaper than then</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.879" end="00:07:04.840" style="s2">car ownership but they&#39;re not making a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.530" end="00:07:06.789" style="s2">rational evaluation about this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.840" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">not making like a rational decision</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.789" end="00:07:10.509" style="s2">because most purchases are irrational</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">does a huge advertising business which</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.509" end="00:07:20.530" style="s2">support this um so they&#39;re still talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:22.780" style="s2">about how they&#39;re gonna do any of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.530" end="00:07:23.650" style="s2">safety is the gating metric yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.780" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">sure sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.650" end="00:07:29.650" style="s2">GM is uniquely positioned in the IRT as</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:32.620" style="s2">I say the word uniqueness in this in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.650" end="00:07:35.319" style="s2">this presentation oh okay so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.620" end="00:07:35.789" style="s2">execution um talent is the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.319" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.789" end="00:07:41.020" style="s2">so so when you brag about talent you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:47.319" style="s2">brag about how you&#39;ve recruited people</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.020" end="00:07:51.699" style="s2">from uber and Google boo at Google our</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.319" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">competitors in this space how do you win</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.699" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">if you are bragging about it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:07:58.029" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways you could you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:01.240" style="s2">still win but you need you need</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.029" end="00:08:03.370" style="s2">something else right um and I&#39;ll explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.240" end="00:08:06.490" style="s2">a concept in in in poker called called</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.370" end="00:08:12.340" style="s2">domination and domination basically are</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.490" end="00:08:15.880" style="s2">look like if your hand is ace king this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.340" end="00:08:17.979" style="s2">is a pretty good hand to have unless</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.880" end="00:08:25.300" style="s2">somebody else at the table has baseness</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.979" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">alright this is Texas Hold&#39;em if seventy</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:30.630" style="s2">nine wow people are into this man okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:32.950" style="s2">so so listen if flop comes over right</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.630" end="00:08:34.450" style="s2">let&#39;s say let&#39;s say so so figured you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.950" end="00:08:35.950" style="s2">have a go-go player one sitting here</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.450" end="00:08:39.579" style="s2">with an ace and your player two sitting</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.950" end="00:08:41.469" style="s2">here with a scam right um if the flop</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.579" end="00:08:42.500" style="s2">comes over and there&#39;s an ace on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.469" end="00:08:45.790" style="s2">flop let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.500" end="00:08:49.700" style="s2">something like ace seven six right</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.790" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">player 2 thinks through in a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">position to aces but they&#39;re really not</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">because player 1 has has three aces</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:59.570" style="s2">right let&#39;s even say it it&#39;s Kings at</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">six right player two still believes that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.570" end="00:09:04.610" style="s2">they are in a good position</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:06.770" style="s2">even though player 1 is right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.610" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">player 3 is of course sitting at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.770" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">table with you know eight nine eight</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:15.140" style="s2">nine maybe there are suited connectors</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:19.310" style="s2">right player three is in a better</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.140" end="00:09:20.900" style="s2">position than player two right because</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.310" end="00:09:22.960" style="s2">think about how many outs player 2 has</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.900" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">versus how many outs player three has</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.960" end="00:09:29.780" style="s2">even if they came up the only real way</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:31.460" style="s2">player 2 wins this not with another ace</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.780" end="00:09:36.650" style="s2">right another ace player 3 is three of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.460" end="00:09:39.170" style="s2">kind to two pair but even if another</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.650" end="00:09:40.820" style="s2">king comes up that&#39;s the the only way</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.170" end="00:09:43.430" style="s2">player 2 can win as if a king comes up</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.820" end="00:09:45.620" style="s2">right versus player three which could</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.430" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2">win of either a a 10 or 5 cuts I write a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.620" end="00:09:53.480" style="s2">lot their strengths minister it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:55.670" style="s2">be so you do not want to be player 2 and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.480" end="00:10:02.870" style="s2">I&#39;ll mark you why Cruz is player 2 right</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.670" end="00:10:04.510" style="s2">now all components need to be six I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">developed for a successful launch right</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.510" end="00:10:14.030" style="s2">the problem is the exact same slide</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">exists at lame-o but way mo has more of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.030" end="00:10:21.410" style="s2">these boxes filled in you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:21.890" style="s2">really hoping like like why am I doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.410" end="00:10:23.660" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.890" end="00:10:26.450" style="s2">I&#39;m really hoping some investors will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.660" end="00:10:29.270" style="s2">able to hopefully like start to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.450" end="00:10:32.660" style="s2">critically evaluate what this space</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.270" end="00:10:34.790" style="s2">looks like and realized why if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.660" end="00:10:37.940" style="s2">the Ace King if you&#39;re saying I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.790" end="00:10:44.750" style="s2">to build what way mo is building how are</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.940" end="00:10:48.310" style="s2">you going to beat way mo so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.750" end="00:10:51.320" style="s2">silver bullet for AV technology I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.310" end="00:10:53.690" style="s2">really that&#39;s at least a statement</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.320" end="00:10:54.889" style="s2">that&#39;s at least a statement where</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.690" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">something&#39;s being said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.889" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">but their compote is an engineer this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:00.859" style="s2">a section right he is he is an engineer</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">you can tell that he&#39;s thinking like an</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.859" end="00:11:08.209" style="s2">engineer because he&#39;s making statements</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:10.339" style="s2">that have another like you you can argue</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.209" end="00:11:12.859" style="s2">the other side right now I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.339" end="00:11:15.079" style="s2">your side is wrong but you are wrong by</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.859" end="00:11:16.699" style="s2">default if there is no other side or</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.079" end="00:11:18.829" style="s2">you&#39;re not even wrong you&#39;re just saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.699" end="00:11:21.439" style="s2">nothing and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.829" end="00:11:24.169" style="s2">everybody should use when they evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.439" end="00:11:26.239" style="s2">anything in the world right like think</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.169" end="00:11:31.669" style="s2">about the other position and whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.239" end="00:11:33.739" style="s2">it&#39;s a viable position right if people</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.669" end="00:11:38.689" style="s2">stopped like like likley please start</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.739" end="00:11:40.129" style="s2">evaluating what is being said right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.689" end="00:11:41.419" style="s2">now you&#39;ll think about the other side</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.129" end="00:11:43.220" style="s2">and don&#39;t attribute Mouse to the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.419" end="00:11:44.809" style="s2">side if there is another side right but</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.220" end="00:11:47.959" style="s2">if there is no this type realize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.809" end="00:11:52.489" style="s2">saying nothing cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.959" end="00:11:53.720" style="s2">so no silver bullet for a check for any</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.489" end="00:11:55.309" style="s2">technology I mean maybe there is right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.720" end="00:11:57.319" style="s2">there was a silver bullet for a girl</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.309" end="00:12:00.019" style="s2">playing I mean maybe now I&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.319" end="00:12:03.019" style="s2">I&#39;ll do a little bit of contrasting this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.019" end="00:12:04.819" style="s2">with what comma believes um so there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.019" end="00:12:06.949" style="s2">a silver bullet for go playing right if</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.819" end="00:12:08.629" style="s2">you can you can kind of think of all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.949" end="00:12:10.189" style="s2">same stuff if you are trying to build a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.629" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">go agent you can imagine a company</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.189" end="00:12:13.759" style="s2">trying to build a go agent um you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.439" style="s2">they&#39;re like well okay so we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.759" end="00:12:18.199" style="s2">some sort of some awesome some endgame</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.439" end="00:12:20.929" style="s2">study some some opening moves study some</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.199" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">jokes Seki study you right and the truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.929" end="00:12:23.839" style="s2">is that none of this matter at all I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:24.559" style="s2">mean in fact so much didn&#39;t matter at</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.839" end="00:12:26.209" style="s2">all that you didn&#39;t even need the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.559" end="00:12:29.529" style="s2">historical data you just needed to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.209" end="00:12:31.369" style="s2">one maybe a silver bullet your magical</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.529" end="00:12:33.949" style="s2">reinforcement learning algorithm and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.369" end="00:12:36.019" style="s2">alphago zero so this is a this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.949" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">is a state and maybe it wasn&#39;t even made</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.019" end="00:12:40.519" style="s2">this way maybe it wasn&#39;t even made as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:42.049" style="s2">statement that could have another side</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.519" end="00:12:43.610" style="s2">argue but I will argue the other side</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.049" end="00:12:46.850" style="s2">and I will argue that the silver bullet</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.610" end="00:12:48.649" style="s2">for maybe technology is reinforcement</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.850" end="00:12:51.799" style="s2">learning is is sophisticated machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.649" end="00:12:53.629" style="s2">learning because we if you we live in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.799" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">the alphago&#39;s 0 world that changed the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.629" end="00:13:00.070" style="s2">world um deep simulation capability</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.070" end="00:13:04.540" style="s2">does Cruz think their simulator is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.810" end="00:13:05.560" style="s2">better than huevos when was this thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.540" end="00:13:08.709" style="s2">called car crafter it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.560" end="00:13:09.759" style="s2">sophisticated simulator um best</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.709" end="00:13:11.110" style="s2">simulator in the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.759" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">great simulator wish I had access to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.110" end="00:13:14.709" style="s2">right just cruise think they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:19.000" style="s2">simulators better than weightless right</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.709" end="00:13:20.069" style="s2">um HD map they can route it who&#39;s miss</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.000" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">mafic company in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.069" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">what are you use Maps well you use you</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:25.480" style="s2">use one of three everybody pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">uses one of three you&#39;re either using</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.480" end="00:13:28.930" style="s2">Google Maps ways or Apple Maps and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not using Apple maps cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.930" end="00:13:31.569" style="s2">your first choice you&#39;re using Apple</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:33.579" style="s2">house cuz it came to your iPhone um</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.569" end="00:13:35.050" style="s2">Google Maps and ways are actually owned</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.579" end="00:13:36.730" style="s2">by the same company called Google which</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.050" end="00:13:38.680" style="s2">is also my alphabet which is the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.730" end="00:13:41.019" style="s2">company that also owns way mode right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.680" end="00:13:43.410" style="s2">so who is the best HD mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.019" end="00:13:49.779" style="s2">routing company in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.410" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">Google proprietary AV sensors okay so so</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.779" end="00:13:54.550" style="s2">now you&#39;re telling me you&#39;re gonna build</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:56.069" style="s2">custom light so so so so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.550" end="00:14:00.670" style="s2">about the three things we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.069" end="00:14:02.730" style="s2">simulation mapping and light swipe these</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.670" end="00:14:05.290" style="s2">on the right that&#39;s really that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.730" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">because this is this is like a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.290" end="00:14:08.500" style="s2">for maybe company right maybe I should</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:11.459" style="s2">have kept the poker hands on the board</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.500" end="00:14:17.560" style="s2">because that really is the analogy um</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.459" end="00:14:23.570" style="s2">you know your simulation mapping</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.560" end="00:14:27.200" style="s2">and so this is one path to self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.570" end="00:14:28.970" style="s2">cars um it might be the right path I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.200" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">not arguing like like like whether it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:16.540" style="s2">maybe this is the you know traditional</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.710" end="00:16:19.450" style="s2">right um now there&#39;s another stack the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.540" end="00:16:22.360" style="s2">other stack is the amount stack and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.450" end="00:16:30.490" style="s2">is kind of where comma lies and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">testing lies so if you think about big</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.490" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">data and machine now you can of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:41.410" style="s2">like the same argument for for comma and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.790" style="s2">Tesla between between Google Cruz are</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.410" end="00:16:45.160" style="s2">you talking about I tell actually both</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.790" end="00:16:47.710" style="s2">the advantages here um but we</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.160" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">acknowledge this fact right and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:54.370" style="s2">is Tesla has a disadvantage Tesla has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">substantial disadvantage and Tesla&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.370" end="00:17:00.700" style="s2">disadvantages the following proprietor I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:03.490" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to spell that word so say</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.700" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a less and they also had easy use</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.490" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">right so if you believe the following</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:10.690" style="s2">two things about Tesla if you believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:13.450" style="s2">that Tesla&#39;s never go into licensed</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.690" end="00:17:16.120" style="s2">autopilot technology probably pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.450" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">likely um then you can talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.120" end="00:17:19.480" style="s2">know this is working okay for comma and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:22.360" style="s2">you can also believe that Tesla will</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.480" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">never build non electrical um and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.360" end="00:17:27.190" style="s2">thing here is autonomous is going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.420" style="s2">happen before electric because of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.190" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">network effect that I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.420" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.810" end="00:17:34.830" style="s2">about how we can&#39;t have the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.760" end="00:17:36.690" style="s2">here because I mean you know my zero</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.830" end="00:17:38.820" style="s2">emissions I&#39;m a fan of zero emissions</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.690" end="00:17:46.290" style="s2">too but you know it&#39;s not my worldview</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.820" end="00:17:48.330" style="s2">right so let&#39;s go back to the this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.290" end="00:17:53.390" style="s2">really the main point I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.330" end="00:17:53.390" style="s2">right like how are you going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.870" end="00:17:58.590" style="s2">justice Google Google understands their</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.210" end="00:17:59.940" style="s2">execution problem like at least they</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.590" end="00:18:01.170" style="s2">understand what their own mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.940" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">they can bring it out of a car company</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.170" end="00:18:05.730" style="s2">CEO they brought me on that guy you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">you watching the robot summon is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.730" end="00:18:12.270" style="s2">right he&#39;s right he understands where</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:13.680" style="s2">Google&#39;s previous failings are now if I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.270" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">were label of course but I would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.680" end="00:18:18.120" style="s2">doing is I would open that the Pacifica</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:20.100" style="s2">platform all right now to people right</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.120" end="00:18:37.260" style="s2">just just just do it man just ship it</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.650" end="00:19:57.390" style="s2">you can talk about the traditional stack</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.420" end="00:20:00.420" style="s2">or the ml stack right um which one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.390" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">these wins is it yet to be discovered</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.420" end="00:20:04.860" style="s2">fact about the world</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.140" end="00:20:22.710" style="s2">I mean to be fair way Moe&#39;s got the Aces</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.470" end="00:20:24.390" style="s2">and we got the the nine-eight of course</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.690" end="00:21:52.670" style="s2">difficult to run on it oh yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.490" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">physical build Nate&#39;s talking in town</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:58.620" style="s2">sounds good Hey look man in town</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:00.150" style="s2">you guys keep building faster processors</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.620" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">and we&#39;ll keep building slower operating</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.150" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">systems so yeah I mean what what are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.220" end="00:22:10.410" style="s2">what are our advantages over Tesla you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">see like the equipment is if way mo wins</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.410" end="00:22:19.590" style="s2">and beats crews they beat crews if Tesla</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:22.410" style="s2">Widow really launches their service a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.590" end="00:22:25.020" style="s2">year before crews has a service ready to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.410" end="00:22:26.520" style="s2">launch they&#39;d have to be the dumbest</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.020" end="00:22:28.560" style="s2">people in history to not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.520" end="00:22:31.230" style="s2">scale that up and to not be able to like</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.560" end="00:22:32.520" style="s2">come on that&#39;s an easy problem compared</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.230" end="00:22:36.060" style="s2">to like the technical engineering</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.520" end="00:22:41.550" style="s2">probably software right if Tesla wins</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.060" end="00:22:43.250" style="s2">and thoroughly wins we went to we went</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.550" end="00:22:46.740" style="s2">to in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.250" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2">iOS is never going to have 95 percent</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.740" end="00:22:51.150" style="s2">market share because iPhones are too</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:52.680" style="s2">expensive and they&#39;re only supported</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.150" end="00:22:55.410" style="s2">well they&#39;re supported by one company</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.680" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">and they guess there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.410" end="00:22:58.950" style="s2">corresponding infrastructure problem and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:00.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no fundamental reason that Apple</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.950" end="00:23:02.460" style="s2">won&#39;t build things that might look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.210" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">Android phones right which is why what</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.460" end="00:23:06.330" style="s2">you see in the iOS and so why is comma</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.130" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">different from way mo because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:09.210" style="s2">trying to completely different approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">whether this approach or this approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.210" end="00:23:13.260" style="s2">wins remains to be seen this is a fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:15.900" style="s2">yet to be discovered about the world and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.260" end="00:23:19.740" style="s2">whether Tesla or comma wins I argue that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.900" end="00:23:23.310" style="s2">there&#39;s no income losses even if Tesla</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.740" end="00:23:25.770" style="s2">crushes it even if Tesla in fact there</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">Tesla autopilot like you know by the end</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.770" end="00:23:30.090" style="s2">of this year is level 3 thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:31.740" style="s2">the existence proof right thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.090" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">telling me that I know I can build</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.740" end="00:23:35.340" style="s2">something that good right even if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:36.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know how it works just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.340" end="00:23:38.220" style="s2">know it makes it a little bit easier you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.840" end="00:23:40.110" style="s2">kind of think okay well I know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:41.310" style="s2">works I&#39;m sure I can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.110" end="00:23:42.900" style="s2">do that all right you see this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.310" end="00:23:44.430" style="s2">science all the time you see that things</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.900" end="00:23:47.370" style="s2">get discovered really really close to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.430" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">each other so yeah if Tesla wins , wins</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.370" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">if Weibo wins</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.559" end="00:23:56.299" style="s2">I just don&#39;t really see it right I was</p>
