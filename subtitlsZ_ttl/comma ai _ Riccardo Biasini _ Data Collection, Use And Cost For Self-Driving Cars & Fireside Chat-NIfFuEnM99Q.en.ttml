<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">level one well is what we can buy today</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">pretty much every new car that we buy is</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:01.109" style="s2">considered level one the human is fully</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">in control of the car and the car</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:05.580" style="s2">provides some driver of system features</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:07.320" style="s2">so for example it can provide adaptive</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">detects that for example you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">strapped and you are departing the lane</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">but the point is you are fully in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">control of the car and you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">interacting with the car the next level</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">is called able to probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">notable example of level 2 system is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">test auto pilot and here the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">behavior of the car is completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">different the car is now fully in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">control of driving and the driver when</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">the system is activated system watches</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">that the car is actually doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s different we go from car</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">driving to the front from the driver</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.439" style="s2">being fully in control to the car being</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">control and the driver assisting the car</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.439" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">the next step is is level trip I the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">marked the transition to level 3 we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">it like a vertical line because here the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">departing change like the main</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">difference is that the liability goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.830" style="s2">from being from the driver from level 1</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:14.410" style="s2">level 2 no matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.830" end="00:02:17.080" style="s2">happens the driver is responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.410" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">driving from level 3 and above the car</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.080" end="00:02:22.450" style="s2">is actually takes the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:25.270" style="s2">whenever they sell driving features are</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.450" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">active so what level 3 allows the driver</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.270" end="00:02:29.020" style="s2">to do is allows the driver to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">distracted does not require the driver</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.020" end="00:02:34.990" style="s2">to be ready to take over immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:37.780" style="s2">it works a limited environment and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.990" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">always guarantees a few seconds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.780" end="00:02:41.230" style="s2">safety operation even when the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.730" style="s2">detects like a situation that cannot</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.230" end="00:02:44.650" style="s2">handle so you imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.730" end="00:02:46.900" style="s2">driving you are like reading a book or</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.650" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">reading your email the car detects</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.900" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">something that cannot handle then is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:55.030" style="s2">gonna beep at you and it&#39;s gonna still</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.910" end="00:02:56.740" style="s2">perform safe operation for maybe 5 to 8</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.030" end="00:02:59.410" style="s2">seconds that&#39;s what it&#39;s considered like</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.740" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">a good transition time and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.410" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">to take control</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:06.040" style="s2">the next step is level 4 I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.920" style="s2">good a good example like of level 4 car</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.040" end="00:03:10.570" style="s2">C is what we see in from deployed from</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.920" end="00:03:11.610" style="s2">way more like there are many other</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.570" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.610" end="00:03:19.000" style="s2">zooks or crew is GM they&#39;re all working</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:21.100" style="s2">on level 4 so what level 4 is well if</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.000" end="00:03:22.510" style="s2">taking the driver out of the loop like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.100" end="00:03:24.880" style="s2">let&#39;s take the driver completely out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.510" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">the car and let&#39;s have like a driverless</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.880" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">vehicle working in limited environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:35.080" style="s2">the next example the next level is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:37.810" style="s2">called level 5 level 5 is devolution of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:38.860" style="s2">level 4 is likely before but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.810" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">working in with the environment is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.860" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">supposed to work everywhere at any time</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">without a human so it needs to work at</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:50.440" style="s2">least as good as human everywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">personally believe that it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.440" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">I the two levels that are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">where people are working on are either</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:57.610" style="s2">level 2 or level 4 and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">ones that we should pay close close</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.610" end="00:04:03.820" style="s2">attention in the evolution of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:06.070" style="s2">technology so what why do I say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.820" end="00:04:07.600" style="s2">I like level 2 and level 4 are the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.070" end="00:04:10.630" style="s2">important one well let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.600" end="00:04:12.670" style="s2">number so let&#39;s look at how many cars</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:14.500" style="s2">like what are the distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.670" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">levels on the cars today on the market</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.500" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">in United States it is 7.2 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:22.300" style="s2">cars deployed like that we see on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">road today a level zero so they have no</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.300" end="00:04:25.449" style="s2">assistance if you look around pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">much like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.449" end="00:04:32.500" style="s2">one one in seven like six out of seven</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:35.650" style="s2">cars that you see I have no assistance</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.500" end="00:04:37.900" style="s2">at all then there is about like 12% of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.650" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">cars that have level one so they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.900" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">limited assistance pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">new cars going to this category and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">there is about like a 0.2 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:51.340" style="s2">cars that are considered level 2 I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:53.669" style="s2">say the 0 2 percent is like in large</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.340" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">portion made by Tessa auto pilot and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.669" end="00:05:01.300" style="s2">like less less extent from like crew GM</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:06.699" style="s2">and few other example that are popping</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.300" end="00:05:08.979" style="s2">out from from automakers so what why do</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.699" end="00:05:11.409" style="s2">I say that for example like level 3 is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.979" end="00:05:13.630" style="s2">not so interesting and I don&#39;t see level</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.409" end="00:05:17.050" style="s2">3 being the next evolution like the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.630" end="00:05:20.289" style="s2">step to us like a driverless future</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:22.419" style="s2">well because level 3 by definition needs</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.289" end="00:05:24.310" style="s2">to guarantee few seconds automated</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.419" end="00:05:27.669" style="s2">driving we anything counter situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.310" end="00:05:30.130" style="s2">that you cannot handle doing that is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.669" end="00:05:33.009" style="s2">easy at all imagine that the system like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.130" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">it&#39;s driving a highway at 70 miles per</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.009" end="00:05:35.620" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">like maybe 775 and it encounter a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.620" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">situation that does not how to handle</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">well doing safe operation for</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:43.289" style="s2">five-second means that you travel pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">much like more than a football field</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.289" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">doing doing and so yeah keep the car</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:52.810" style="s2">doing something safe it&#39;s pretty much as</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">other solving for level four even if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.810" end="00:05:55.990" style="s2">only have to guarantee those those few</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:05:58.539" style="s2">seconds when the current counter</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.990" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">situation that you cannot handle well</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.539" end="00:06:02.680" style="s2">you can say well yeah but it&#39;s true what</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.240" end="00:06:05.319" style="s2">you&#39;re saying but there is one car that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.680" end="00:06:07.870" style="s2">actually shipped on the market the test</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.319" end="00:06:12.039" style="s2">level 3 and it&#39;s true it&#39;s called a e8</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.870" end="00:06:14.979" style="s2">is the Audi a8 it that it did not ship</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.039" end="00:06:17.590" style="s2">us for regulatory reasons but let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.979" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">at the limitation of such system so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.590" end="00:06:21.219" style="s2">need to be on a multi-lane you order you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">need to be you have to have bar in</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.219" end="00:06:25.960" style="s2">between lanes so pretty much like on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">high-speed highway you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.960" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">structure along the edge to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:31.389" style="s2">that there are no pedestrians your speed</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:33.550" style="s2">needs to be lower than 37 miles per hour</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.389" end="00:06:35.529" style="s2">and the speed of the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.550" end="00:06:36.999" style="s2">vehicles is also low</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.529" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.999" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">this is almost impossible situation to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.689" style="s2">meet and it&#39;s not what level Terry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:46.089" style="s2">supposed to be is just like an extension</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.689" end="00:06:47.860" style="s2">of level two if something goes wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.089" end="00:06:50.019" style="s2">this situation nothing bad can really</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.860" end="00:06:54.999" style="s2">happen and so yes the car can take like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.019" end="00:06:57.279" style="s2">liability for the situation it does not</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.999" end="00:06:58.809" style="s2">scale to situation like requiring faster</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.279" end="00:07:03.009" style="s2">reaction time if you&#39;re driving highway</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.809" end="00:07:05.469" style="s2">at high speed you you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.009" end="00:07:10.029" style="s2">handle the situation and probably you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.469" end="00:07:11.079" style="s2">need like level four technology so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.029" end="00:07:11.829" style="s2">about there before level so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.079" end="00:07:14.409" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.829" end="00:07:18.219" style="s2">technical challenge there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.409" end="00:07:20.199" style="s2">companies working on it but what woody</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.219" end="00:07:22.329" style="s2">is live at four what does level four try</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.199" end="00:07:24.219" style="s2">to solve that well let&#39;s think about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.329" end="00:07:27.699" style="s2">which is the definition of likely before</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.219" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">so like we have level four car so how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.699" end="00:07:30.279" style="s2">they work</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" end="00:07:32.619" style="s2">well the idea is that they allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.279" end="00:07:36.099" style="s2">go from point A to point B without</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.619" end="00:07:38.589" style="s2">requiring you to drive and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.099" end="00:07:41.889" style="s2">about it these already exist like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.589" end="00:07:43.899" style="s2">taxi there uber I can I can use public</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.889" end="00:07:46.569" style="s2">transportation so they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.899" end="00:07:48.429" style="s2">replace a service that already exists</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.569" end="00:07:49.689" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be more practical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.429" end="00:07:51.429" style="s2">not gonna be more practical the rubber</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.689" end="00:07:52.389" style="s2">is not gonna be more practical in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.429" end="00:07:53.409" style="s2">certain cases in the public</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.389" end="00:07:54.909" style="s2">transportation if you live in Manhattan</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.409" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">you want to go from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.909" end="00:07:58.659" style="s2">probably taking the metro is the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.610" style="s2">way to do it so what&#39;s the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.659" end="00:08:02.019" style="s2">living for well the Vantage is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.610" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">that they are going to cost less why</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.019" end="00:08:05.889" style="s2">because the idea is to remove the driver</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.919" style="s2">and to remove the cost of the driver</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.889" end="00:08:13.839" style="s2">which I personally have some some doubts</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.919" end="00:08:15.969" style="s2">by when you pay dry you will drive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.839" end="00:08:19.989" style="s2">not a big portion of your fare that goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.969" end="00:08:21.489" style="s2">to the driver the big majority pays for</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.989" end="00:08:27.429" style="s2">the car maintenance their insurer gas</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.489" end="00:08:29.469" style="s2">and the fees to Ober so level four by</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.429" end="00:08:31.379" style="s2">definition since it&#39;s not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.469" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">drive anywhere anytime</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.379" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">does not compete with Kenosha P is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:37.899" style="s2">meant when the car ownership but this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.909" style="s2">idea that whenever four succeed the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.899" end="00:08:42.419" style="s2">people we stop owning cars so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.909" end="00:08:46.059" style="s2">not what level four is going to give us</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.419" end="00:08:50.930" style="s2">and it was like very unclear how long</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.059" end="00:08:53.330" style="s2">such a service will take to be better of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.930" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">uber lyft public transportation in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.330" end="00:09:02.900" style="s2">of cost and practicality so what about</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:04.610" style="s2">level five like I said I when I show the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.900" end="00:09:07.130" style="s2">slide before about the levels I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.610" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">show any example of companies working on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.130" end="00:09:10.460" style="s2">level five because literally nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:12.530" style="s2">working right now on level five it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.460" end="00:09:14.630" style="s2">very our problem those are two famous</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.530" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">quotes that I usually put in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.630" end="00:09:19.640" style="s2">presentation one is from Iran in 2016 he</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:21.170" style="s2">said that in about two years someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.640" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">which is the function that is supposed</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.460" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">in about two years so 2018 the car was</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.410" end="00:09:38.360" style="s2">able to have this function working from</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.660" end="00:09:54.950" style="s2">was like the ex chief of the cell</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.950" end="00:10:00.200" style="s2">way more and it was respecting that his</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.200" end="00:10:06.380" style="s2">driver license by the time that he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">going to be 16 that was in 2015 his son</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.380" end="00:10:12.410" style="s2">was 12 now I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">than than 16 years old and I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.410" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">sure he got his driver license why why</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually like our to to solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">before for level five and nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:24.590" style="s2">working on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:28.190" style="s2">well it&#39;s very it&#39;s very challenging</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.590" end="00:10:30.650" style="s2">problem you have to solve for situations</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.190" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">that are very hard to train a system for</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.650" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">a new man are very good at it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">because they actually use like things</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:43.070" style="s2">that they have learned outside driving</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.970" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">the first time that I drove a car myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.070" end="00:10:50.900" style="s2">I did okay how come if I never drove a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:53.720" style="s2">car well I did okay because I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.900" end="00:10:56.030" style="s2">actually I was actually transferring the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.720" end="00:11:00.530" style="s2">learning that I did outside</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.030" end="00:11:04.190" style="s2">driving to to driving itself so how much</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.530" end="00:11:05.660" style="s2">of of driving is actually you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.190" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">skills that have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.660" end="00:11:09.560" style="s2">driving it&#39;s possible that to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:11.480" style="s2">replace the driver entirely in any</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.560" end="00:11:12.620" style="s2">situation you might need some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.480" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">like artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.620" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">systems being developed first and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.699" style="s2">this is this is something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:23.529" style="s2">definitely gonna take a while and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.699" end="00:11:26.300" style="s2">don&#39;t see it being like in a closer eye</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.529" end="00:11:27.970" style="s2">so while it will chew that well so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.300" end="00:11:30.319" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about I will show is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.970" end="00:11:33.470" style="s2">people spend five percent of the awake</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.319" end="00:11:36.529" style="s2">time driving and while you drive you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.470" end="00:11:37.970" style="s2">pretty much take and one action of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.529" end="00:11:39.649" style="s2">compacting the gas core I think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.970" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">brake or correcting the steer pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.649" end="00:11:43.939" style="s2">much every second so if you dry for</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.660" end="00:11:46.639" style="s2">about like 20 hours like three hours so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.939" end="00:11:48.170" style="s2">straight that&#39;s about 10,000 single</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.639" end="00:11:51.639" style="s2">intervention that you have to make to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.170" end="00:11:54.110" style="s2">your car and that&#39;s actively stressful</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.639" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">another thing that is worth noticing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.110" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">that there have been last year to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:01.550" style="s2">seven fatal accidents in the u.s. that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:05.209" style="s2">an increase of 15 percent from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.550" end="00:12:07.639" style="s2">minimum reach in 2014 this is like quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.209" end="00:12:10.579" style="s2">interesting because an unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.639" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">because for many decades fatal accidents</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.579" end="00:12:15.500" style="s2">in US have been going down the reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:17.689" style="s2">why has been going up since 2014 is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.500" end="00:12:21.339" style="s2">people are more distracted while driving</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.689" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">they look more therefore and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.339" end="00:12:26.779" style="s2">unfortunately this made more fatal</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:28.730" style="s2">accidents and so there is really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.779" end="00:12:30.259" style="s2">need of making sure that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.730" end="00:12:38.750" style="s2">system monitoring the driver paying</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.259" end="00:12:41.509" style="s2">attention so another very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.750" end="00:12:42.920" style="s2">thing to know is and this is great if</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.509" end="00:12:44.269" style="s2">there&#39;s a level 1 cache on today so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.920" end="00:12:47.930" style="s2">pretty much every New Castle today</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.269" end="00:12:50.569" style="s2">already have the hardware to be a level</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.930" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">2 system to constitute to our level 2</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.569" end="00:12:53.509" style="s2">system like if you think about every one</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">cars since they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.509" end="00:12:56.449" style="s2">maintaining distance for the car in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:57.709" style="s2">front of you are able to steer you back</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.449" end="00:12:59.870" style="s2">in the lane if you are about to depart</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.709" end="00:13:02.509" style="s2">the lane it means that they had ways of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.870" end="00:13:05.870" style="s2">controlling the gas the brake and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.509" end="00:13:07.309" style="s2">steer and so those those actuator can</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.870" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">actually be controlled in a better way</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.309" end="00:13:12.350" style="s2">not only to provide level 1 features but</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:13.880" style="s2">actually level features the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.350" end="00:13:16.459" style="s2">cars that we see on the market today</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.880" end="00:13:17.300" style="s2">have only level 1 features and not level</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.459" end="00:13:20.060" style="s2">2</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.300" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">piñon is because of cars are developed</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.060" end="00:13:23.660" style="s2">with a very long development process</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:25.339" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible to make over-the-air</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.660" end="00:13:26.180" style="s2">update in pretty much like every car on</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.339" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">the market today</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.180" end="00:13:33.890" style="s2">except for Tesla and the car the car</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">like the arguer that makes your chassis</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.890" end="00:13:38.899" style="s2">like your actuators is very integrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:40.640" style="s2">with the arguer that makes your</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.899" end="00:13:42.589" style="s2">computing and the software that comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.640" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">with the car and if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.589" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">lifespan of a car average lifespan of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:49.640" style="s2">car is 15 years think about how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:51.769" style="s2">like computing and computers have</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.640" end="00:13:53.959" style="s2">changed in 15 years so I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.769" end="00:13:56.630" style="s2">there is this need to decouple the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.959" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">armour of the cars like what was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.630" end="00:14:01.130" style="s2">chasm was your actuators and was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:03.110" style="s2">what makes the hour before you can from</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.130" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2">your computing hardware which is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">actually makes your your</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:14.300" style="s2">driver-assistance features so well in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:16.339" style="s2">order to the sky whatever to is we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.300" end="00:14:18.649" style="s2">just look at the video this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.339" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">our system that we developed at comedy I</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.649" end="00:14:24.350" style="s2">if you can see the system itself like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.010" end="00:14:27.140" style="s2">they are where is mounted on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.350" end="00:14:30.020" style="s2">windshield it connects with the can</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.140" end="00:14:31.940" style="s2">which is the communication system off of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.020" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">the car and this is retrofitting a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.940" end="00:14:37.700" style="s2">level-one car which is a 2016 conceal so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:39.950" style="s2">how does a level-two system works well</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.700" end="00:14:42.589" style="s2">so the idea is that you press a button</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.950" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">you engage and then the car handles</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.589" end="00:14:46.610" style="s2">driving for you you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.970" end="00:14:48.529" style="s2">attention but the car will keep in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.610" end="00:14:50.630" style="s2">lane will slow down will accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.529" end="00:14:52.130" style="s2">depending on traffic conditions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.630" end="00:14:56.540" style="s2">other information that they can gather</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.130" end="00:14:59.480" style="s2">from the environment so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.540" end="00:15:01.160" style="s2">different way of driving of course as</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.480" end="00:15:03.260" style="s2">the system gets better it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.160" end="00:15:05.480" style="s2">important that the driver keeps paying</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.260" end="00:15:06.829" style="s2">attention and so every level to system</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.480" end="00:15:08.510" style="s2">as the level to system gets better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.829" end="00:15:10.970" style="s2">very important to monitor the diver and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.510" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">so in our system this is done by a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:14.899" style="s2">camera that is also watching the driver</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:17.000" style="s2">so there are two cameras one looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.899" end="00:15:23.000" style="s2">the road and one watching the driver so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.000" end="00:15:26.779" style="s2">how does driver monitoring works so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.000" end="00:15:27.460" style="s2">idea is that the camera is watching you</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.779" end="00:15:29.980" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.460" end="00:15:31.630" style="s2">if you for example while driving you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.980" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">being distracted so you&#39;re looking away</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.630" end="00:15:35.380" style="s2">from the Honda or for example you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:37.089" style="s2">falling asleep or anything the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.380" end="00:15:38.620" style="s2">detects that you are not looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.089" end="00:15:40.420" style="s2">straight then the system is gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.620" end="00:15:42.130" style="s2">to alert you it&#39;s going to start to beep</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.420" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">at you and then eventually if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.130" end="00:15:45.850" style="s2">take control the system goes into a mode</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna force you to disengage</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.850" end="00:15:51.660" style="s2">the automated feature and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:51.660" style="s2">slowly bring down the car to a safe stop</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.290" end="00:15:58.540" style="s2">so how does like self-driving car works</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.100" end="00:16:02.140" style="s2">like before introducing and talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.540" end="00:16:04.510" style="s2">about data let&#39;s spend a few few words</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.140" end="00:16:07.779" style="s2">about how an architecture or some</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.510" end="00:16:12.520" style="s2">driving car is well you might have seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.779" end="00:16:15.010" style="s2">this before it&#39;s a very standard kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.520" end="00:16:16.900" style="s2">like layout of the system working in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.010" end="00:16:22.360" style="s2">in a self-driving car but more in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.900" end="00:16:24.760" style="s2">general in manual bollix systems so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:27.640" style="s2">have an initial like your input comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.760" end="00:16:30.310" style="s2">from your sensors you use sensors to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.640" end="00:16:33.510" style="s2">sense the world instead of in cars the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.310" end="00:16:36.279" style="s2">sensor typically cameras liders rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.510" end="00:16:41.230" style="s2">ultrasonic sensors and all the sensor</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.279" end="00:16:44.100" style="s2">that you use to perceive the state of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.230" end="00:16:48.910" style="s2">the car itself like accelerometers</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.100" end="00:16:51.190" style="s2">gyroscopes and like magnetometer GPS to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:53.890" style="s2">understand your positions and so once</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.190" end="00:16:56.020" style="s2">you have the data form from the sensor</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.890" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">what you use them for well two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.020" end="00:17:01.330" style="s2">one is you localize yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:03.220" style="s2">localize yourself in in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.330" end="00:17:06.429" style="s2">reference this is very important because</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.220" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">well if you if you are working towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.429" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">like a system with a car like drives</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">itself it needs to be aware of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:18.250" style="s2">position to better Drive you why the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">system is active and it also uses the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.250" end="00:17:23.860" style="s2">input from the sensor to make a semantic</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:27.850" style="s2">representation of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.860" end="00:17:30.580" style="s2">you go from a dense sensor output for</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.850" end="00:17:33.490" style="s2">example for cameras you have these like</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.580" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">million of pixels in RGB format so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.490" end="00:17:38.980" style="s2">very dense it&#39;s very it&#39;s very high</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:40.179" style="s2">dimensional output to something that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.980" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">compress</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.179" end="00:17:44.919" style="s2">and you extract information that then</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:47.320" style="s2">you need that people know how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.919" end="00:17:50.860" style="s2">interpret and then you need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.320" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">going with your flow of operation so in</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.860" end="00:17:55.230" style="s2">to make some example in still driving</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">cars so usually the the perception layer</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.230" end="00:17:59.889" style="s2">determines where lane lines are where</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:02.200" style="s2">cars are and we all the values obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.889" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">on the road are so then you use this</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.200" end="00:18:07.869" style="s2">input to your next block which is called</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:10.090" style="s2">planning so once I know we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.869" end="00:18:12.039" style="s2">obstacle ours I understand my</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:14.590" style="s2">environment in a semantic way then I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.039" end="00:18:18.789" style="s2">plan for it I can generate a trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.590" end="00:18:22.419" style="s2">that I want the car to take once once I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.789" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">have the trajectory I actually have one</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.419" end="00:18:26.679" style="s2">last block which is called controls and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.159" end="00:18:28.389" style="s2">if the block the heart weighs the car</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.679" end="00:18:33.730" style="s2">physically activates the car to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.389" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">sure that the car follows your plan good</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.730" end="00:18:37.779" style="s2">news about the current state of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:39.249" style="s2">self-driving cars and sensor</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.779" end="00:18:42.039" style="s2">localization this is already at</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.249" end="00:18:43.570" style="s2">superhuman level like you can put as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.039" end="00:18:45.399" style="s2">many camera and as many sensor you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.570" end="00:18:48.669" style="s2">around the car you can have at any given</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.399" end="00:18:50.619" style="s2">instant perfectly under 60 view of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.669" end="00:18:51.879" style="s2">surrounding human of course have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.619" end="00:18:54.429" style="s2">their head and they you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.879" end="00:18:57.580" style="s2">sacrifice some field of view while they</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.429" end="00:18:58.840" style="s2">are looking around in selling cars this</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.580" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">is not necessary you can put as many</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.840" end="00:19:05.379" style="s2">sensors as you want and the localization</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:08.710" style="s2">is also super human I mean like for</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.379" end="00:19:12.100" style="s2">example like last year we drove around a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.710" end="00:19:15.309" style="s2">closed track without using any any</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.100" end="00:19:18.009" style="s2">vision input just by using our GPS and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.309" end="00:19:20.669" style="s2">doing a sensor fusion with with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.009" end="00:19:22.869" style="s2">sensor on the car like accelerometer and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.669" end="00:19:24.879" style="s2">gyroscope and we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.869" end="00:19:27.580" style="s2">continuously loop around the track</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.879" end="00:19:30.539" style="s2">without having any sensor and we add</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.580" end="00:19:34.119" style="s2">like I would say probably a precision of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.539" end="00:19:36.399" style="s2">less than one meter like less than three</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.119" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">feet in place in understanding where the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.399" end="00:19:39.159" style="s2">car using what the reference this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:41.769" style="s2">already superhuman like human of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.159" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">don&#39;t understand where they are in world</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.769" end="00:19:47.409" style="s2">reference which such accuracy controls</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:50.619" style="s2">are good enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.409" end="00:19:53.830" style="s2">they are definitely better than human</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.619" end="00:19:54.100" style="s2">when they work in their specific domain</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.830" end="00:19:55.990" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.100" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">operation where they have been developed</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.990" end="00:20:00.970" style="s2">for they don&#39;t work or like they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:02.830" style="s2">little bit trickier to have them work as</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.970" end="00:20:04.690" style="s2">good as human when the condition</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.830" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">suddenly changed so imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.690" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">driving and all a sudden you eat a bump</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">or your steering gets misaligned well</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">then you have to have a Largo a to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:16.360" style="s2">understand that for you driving straight</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:20.260" style="s2">means applying a little steering on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.360" end="00:20:21.730" style="s2">side well so this is you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.260" end="00:20:23.980" style="s2">the situation that you need to handle</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.730" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">and and you know the situation is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.980" end="00:20:28.840" style="s2">trickier and I think human can do these</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:31.890" style="s2">currently better than machines so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.840" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2">adapting to sudden change of your model</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.890" end="00:20:35.980" style="s2">but I I think what Russ I could</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.750" end="00:20:36.970" style="s2">definitely like pros and cons with</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.980" end="00:20:38.830" style="s2">respect to human and they are good</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.970" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">enough it&#39;s now resorting back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.830" end="00:20:44.230" style="s2">driving cars the thing that are like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">highly subhuman human do better than</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.230" end="00:20:47.620" style="s2">machines is a sense of fusion and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:49.240" style="s2">perception implanting suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.620" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">perception like understanding the</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:55.059" style="s2">human are better these typical examples</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.169" end="00:20:56.980" style="s2">there is a long tail of events where</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.059" end="00:20:59.620" style="s2">shell driving car have a little bit hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.980" end="00:21:02.380" style="s2">time handling them so imagine like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.620" end="00:21:04.659" style="s2">see a plastic bag tumbling on the road</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.380" end="00:21:07.059" style="s2">well so that I mean car might recognize</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.659" end="00:21:08.770" style="s2">that there is like an obstacle but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.059" end="00:21:09.970" style="s2">you have to decide is this something</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.770" end="00:21:11.770" style="s2">that I can eat or is this something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.970" end="00:21:13.270" style="s2">I should break for and this decision</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.770" end="00:21:16.530" style="s2">becomes very important if you&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.270" end="00:21:19.659" style="s2">at 65 70 miles per hour down the highway</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.530" end="00:21:21.640" style="s2">planning is also is also very hard the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.659" end="00:21:22.809" style="s2">way that human things like planned their</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.640" end="00:21:24.940" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.809" end="00:21:27.730" style="s2">I personally believe as I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.940" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">before it has more to do with skills</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.730" end="00:21:31.630" style="s2">that not necessarily people have learned</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">from from driving but things that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.630" end="00:21:36.100" style="s2">just understand they have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">like intuition about the physics of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.100" end="00:21:40.840" style="s2">world they just apply and they generate</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:46.090" style="s2">those trajectory and it&#39;s very are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.840" end="00:21:47.740" style="s2">creating algorithms at the base so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.090" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">a better approach which is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.740" end="00:21:55.299" style="s2">torturing at , is putting together and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2">try to solve at once sensor fusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.299" end="00:21:59.350" style="s2">perception planning all some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:22:01.750" style="s2">like more like an end-to-end approach</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.350" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">and I think this is gonna scale better</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.750" end="00:22:07.380" style="s2">than trying to separate these two blocks</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:09.049" style="s2">so what are they</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.380" end="00:22:13.320" style="s2">useful for well that are useful for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.049" end="00:22:15.030" style="s2">improving those those two blocks because</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.320" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">they do need machine learning a machine</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.030" end="00:22:21.150" style="s2">learning can work with with data so</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:25.350" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about data why are they</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.150" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">important in in cell driving cars well</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.350" end="00:22:29.549" style="s2">of course first first thing is to train</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.140" style="s2">your network so you have you collect</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.549" end="00:22:33.630" style="s2">your data you collect your data from</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.140" end="00:22:36.270" style="s2">your devices from your fleet and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.630" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">based on the behavior or the correct</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.270" end="00:22:41.010" style="s2">behavior that the car took on the road</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:45.720" style="s2">you try to train your network that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.010" end="00:22:48.929" style="s2">understand how to drive as they got from</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.720" end="00:22:50.610" style="s2">the example of driving another thing why</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.929" end="00:22:52.590" style="s2">data is important is that you can use</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.610" end="00:22:55.890" style="s2">data to build your own HD Maps this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.590" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">an example of our of the maps that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.890" end="00:23:00.870" style="s2">started to build based on our data you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">can in this case we generated a cloud</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.870" end="00:23:05.909" style="s2">point data set that for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:08.419" style="s2">described the very poor Aging in the Bay</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.909" end="00:23:11.730" style="s2">Area and this is important because</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.419" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">having these informations helps you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.730" end="00:23:17.549" style="s2">localizing very precisely in water</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:19.380" style="s2">reference when when you&#39;re driving data</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.549" end="00:23:21.390" style="s2">is also useful to simulate Andy bargain</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.380" end="00:23:24.390" style="s2">when you can let back data from from</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.390" end="00:23:29.070" style="s2">your fleet you can you can use this data</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.390" end="00:23:30.809" style="s2">to see what happened and you can resume</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.070" end="00:23:34.049" style="s2">elate the data you can you can use</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.809" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">messages are one of our debugging tool</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.049" end="00:23:41.220" style="s2">and you can actually a play part of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">code on the data that you collected to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.220" end="00:23:47.850" style="s2">see how for example some changes of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:49.530" style="s2">code will affect the part of the data</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.850" end="00:23:52.679" style="s2">part of the output it was that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.530" end="00:23:54.360" style="s2">actually collected and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.679" end="00:23:55.860" style="s2">you wanted to collect it in case of cell</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.360" end="00:23:58.230" style="s2">driving cars adventure if you offer a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.860" end="00:24:00.330" style="s2">service to your users at the product</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.230" end="00:24:02.010" style="s2">that we sell is called the chameleon is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.330" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">the device that I will show that I shown</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.010" end="00:24:07.470" style="s2">before in the video and it also work as</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:09.179" style="s2">a smart dash camera so you have cameras</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.470" end="00:24:12.150" style="s2">you can collect data to the cameras and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.179" end="00:24:15.179" style="s2">of course like the user can have access</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.150" end="00:24:17.549" style="s2">to their own data and we built our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.179" end="00:24:18.169" style="s2">like Explorer so if you are like a comm</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.549" end="00:24:20.929" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.169" end="00:24:23.720" style="s2">user then you can go on explore the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.929" end="00:24:27.769" style="s2">common CI and review your drive and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.720" end="00:24:30.049" style="s2">everything that happened so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.769" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s important to talk about is also</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.049" end="00:24:34.999" style="s2">the cost about data collection because</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:37.009" style="s2">we talked about the benefits and someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.999" end="00:24:39.889" style="s2">might have the idea or like the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.009" end="00:24:41.480" style="s2">impression that more data is better well</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.889" end="00:24:43.759" style="s2">you have to consider also that there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.480" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">costs associated to data and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.759" end="00:24:48.289" style="s2">always true that more later is better I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:50.509" style="s2">think good a good plot is the one on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.289" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">right which separates between companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.509" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">that have a like a product in the field</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">and they can collect their data through</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.690" end="00:25:01.399" style="s2">the product that they saw the versus</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:03.019" style="s2">companies that actually have to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.399" end="00:25:06.289" style="s2">their own fleet and they you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.019" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">in order to collect data I mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.289" end="00:25:11.330" style="s2">if you think about how much it has like</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:13.129" style="s2">a how much like individual profit maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.330" end="00:25:17.179" style="s2">Tesla can make on each car and you work</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.129" end="00:25:19.249" style="s2">out the math I believe that Tesla makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.179" end="00:25:20.539" style="s2">money for each mile that they collect</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.249" end="00:25:23.539" style="s2">because it means that they stole more</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.539" end="00:25:26.090" style="s2">cars and I would say like same way is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.539" end="00:25:29.090" style="s2">true for us the more miles we collect it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.090" end="00:25:30.980" style="s2">means the more devices we have solved</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.090" end="00:25:33.169" style="s2">this is definitely not true for</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.980" end="00:25:36.200" style="s2">companies that are working on level 4</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.169" end="00:25:38.539" style="s2">they have to make their own cars they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.200" end="00:25:41.809" style="s2">have to make their own devices and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.539" end="00:25:44.269" style="s2">have to pay drivers at least one in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.809" end="00:25:46.429" style="s2">cases even to that at any given time</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.269" end="00:25:49.159" style="s2">that I scare around and you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.429" end="00:25:50.539" style="s2">basically for their salary and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.159" end="00:25:53.389" style="s2">think about the matter how much you pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.539" end="00:25:56.179" style="s2">each driver but it costs to level four</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.389" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">companies about I like estimate these</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.179" end="00:26:00.830" style="s2">are my estimates I estimate that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:03.350" style="s2">pay about 2.5 dollars about two point</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.830" end="00:26:05.899" style="s2">five dollars per miles if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.350" end="00:26:08.389" style="s2">companies like way more connect pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.899" end="00:26:11.739" style="s2">much the same amount of miles that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.389" end="00:26:14.529" style="s2">collect I believe it&#39;s around several</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.739" end="00:26:17.049" style="s2">tens tens of thousands of miles each day</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.529" end="00:26:19.460" style="s2">well if they paid two point five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.049" end="00:26:21.769" style="s2">x let&#39;s say totally thousand miles</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.460" end="00:26:24.649" style="s2">there&#39;s about 70 thousand dollars per</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.769" end="00:26:27.980" style="s2">day that throughout here that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.649" end="00:26:31.159" style="s2">about like 21 million dollars and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.980" end="00:26:32.179" style="s2">it&#39;s the budget you used to have deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.159" end="00:26:35.059" style="s2">pockets</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.179" end="00:26:36.499" style="s2">if you are owning like 11 for Fleet then</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.059" end="00:26:39.769" style="s2">you are collecting data through your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.499" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">fleet another thing that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.769" end="00:26:43.909" style="s2">consider is like connectivity in Casta</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:46.190" style="s2">you have these devices that collect your</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.909" end="00:26:47.960" style="s2">data how do you get data back well if</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.190" end="00:26:49.639" style="s2">you own your fleet this might be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:54.230" style="s2">little easier because the car gets back</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.639" end="00:26:56.869" style="s2">and you you basically can can stream</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.230" end="00:26:59.570" style="s2">back the data using like physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.869" end="00:27:01.909" style="s2">connection but for our distributed</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.570" end="00:27:03.559" style="s2">devices yeah we can use Wi-Fi but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.909" end="00:27:05.299" style="s2">very convenient for users if can</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.559" end="00:27:07.369" style="s2">actually upload their data through</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.299" end="00:27:09.499" style="s2">cellular connection so a connection is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.369" end="00:27:12.590" style="s2">cost and so these must be considered</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.499" end="00:27:17.230" style="s2">when you when you when you stream back</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.590" end="00:27:19.879" style="s2">data to to your database data center</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.230" end="00:27:25.490" style="s2">other thing that has cost if you use</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.879" end="00:27:28.039" style="s2">data for bit for training in machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.490" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">learning you have to label them and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.039" end="00:27:33.110" style="s2">label is something that is generally</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.860" end="00:27:35.330" style="s2">done by humans so you have to teach</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.110" end="00:27:39.529" style="s2">what&#39;s right to your neural network and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.330" end="00:27:41.779" style="s2">so you do these by having like usually</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.529" end="00:27:45.499" style="s2">done by having like humans like taking a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.779" end="00:27:47.509" style="s2">picture and telling and like taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.499" end="00:27:49.340" style="s2">notes wearing the picture of things are</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.509" end="00:27:51.619" style="s2">what everything in the picture is in</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:57.619" style="s2">this case where cars are where orders</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.619" end="00:28:00.379" style="s2">lane lines buildings etc will come move</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.619" end="00:28:03.019" style="s2">completely away from human labeling and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.379" end="00:28:07.490" style="s2">we try to do everything automated so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.019" end="00:28:11.139" style="s2">use neural networks to label data that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.490" end="00:28:11.139" style="s2">we used to train other neural network</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.470" end="00:28:18.470" style="s2">another thing that if it&#39;s like that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.409" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">pay for is of course processing training</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.470" end="00:28:22.490" style="s2">and data transfer if you have your data</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:25.970" style="s2">stored on the cloud and you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.490" end="00:28:28.190" style="s2">the Descent you do spend on data like</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.970" end="00:28:30.950" style="s2">processing your data you spend</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.190" end="00:28:35.149" style="s2">electricity to train your data because</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.950" end="00:28:36.590" style="s2">they run on GPUs and you do Spanos data</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.149" end="00:28:37.789" style="s2">for data transfer if you go if you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.590" end="00:28:39.799" style="s2">you audit on the cloud you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.789" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">transfer your data to something like an</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.799" end="00:28:46.220" style="s2">eventual if you want to train luckily</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:47.929" style="s2">and this also has a cost and probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.220" end="00:28:51.740" style="s2">the most important thing is the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.929" end="00:28:55.009" style="s2">storage the data one thing that a camera</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.740" end="00:28:58.609" style="s2">we quickly realized is as the number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.009" end="00:29:00.830" style="s2">users that we have keeps growing we saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.609" end="00:29:03.379" style="s2">that I really like steep increase in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.830" end="00:29:05.629" style="s2">storage cost if you think about it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.379" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">if you assume that the number of users</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.629" end="00:29:11.690" style="s2">that you have it&#39;s sort of like growing</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.940" end="00:29:14.869" style="s2">linearly over over time well think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:19.340" style="s2">how much storing their data indefinitely</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.869" end="00:29:22.190" style="s2">is going to cost you I mean generally if</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.340" end="00:29:25.759" style="s2">your function of user increase is called</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.190" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">f of X where X is your time well they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.759" end="00:29:32.210" style="s2">can&#39;t the cost of storing their data is</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:34.700" style="s2">the integral of of f of X because you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.210" end="00:29:37.159" style="s2">have to store their data all date a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.700" end="00:29:39.769" style="s2">data over time and so no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.159" end="00:29:41.359" style="s2">your business model is in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.769" end="00:29:44.269" style="s2">the driving cars where data are</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.359" end="00:29:47.240" style="s2">particularly expensive because in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.269" end="00:29:50.299" style="s2">case every hour of driving is between</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.240" end="00:29:53.720" style="s2">five and ten gigabytes in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.299" end="00:29:55.999" style="s2">level-4 car so I would not be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.720" end="00:29:58.129" style="s2">if every hour of data it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.999" end="00:30:01.190" style="s2">hundreds of gigabytes well you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.129" end="00:30:04.369" style="s2">quickly start to skyrocket your your</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.190" end="00:30:06.950" style="s2">cost of storage if you don&#39;t act on it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.369" end="00:30:13.369" style="s2">and you don&#39;t start like to delete all</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.950" end="00:30:18.769" style="s2">data as your user base actually grows so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.369" end="00:30:21.619" style="s2">some some tips about that data storage</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.769" end="00:30:24.679" style="s2">and use of data I think unless you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.619" end="00:30:27.080" style="s2">as I said before like a lot of lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.679" end="00:30:29.480" style="s2">money people are invested money on you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.080" end="00:30:32.509" style="s2">and you can build your own fleet and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.480" end="00:30:34.070" style="s2">can you can afford of paying tens of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.509" end="00:30:34.639" style="s2">billions of dollars per year in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.070" end="00:30:38.749" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.639" end="00:30:41.779" style="s2">think about making a sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.749" end="00:30:45.049" style="s2">business model around collecting data</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.779" end="00:30:47.389" style="s2">early on in your stage so in case of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.049" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">comma the first product that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.389" end="00:30:52.660" style="s2">released with a dash cam app you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:55.240" style="s2">download from the App Store or from</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.660" end="00:30:57.280" style="s2">from the Google store Google Play you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.240" end="00:31:01.420" style="s2">could not load our app which was called</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.280" end="00:31:03.910" style="s2">shiver and it&#39;s a dashcam and through</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.420" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">the tap we were collecting data the app</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.910" end="00:31:09.720" style="s2">was free but at least we didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:12.400" style="s2">pay for for every day that we collected</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.720" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2">the second product that we released is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.400" end="00:31:16.420" style="s2">was generator</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:19.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a nobody to dangle it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.420" end="00:31:21.700" style="s2">panda and this is the first time that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.240" end="00:31:26.680" style="s2">started to make a profit with a product</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:29.950" style="s2">so by syncing your app with the kanri</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.680" end="00:31:34.510" style="s2">they&#39;re not only we add back vision like</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.950" end="00:31:36.550" style="s2">camera data from from from the car from</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.510" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">your phone but also we were able to sync</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.550" end="00:31:43.480" style="s2">the data with your can with all the data</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:44.830" style="s2">that was running onto your communication</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.480" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">area network which is the protocol of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.830" end="00:31:49.270" style="s2">communication of your car and this was</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.710" style="s2">great because we could like seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.270" end="00:31:52.330" style="s2">the cow everything that was being</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.710" end="00:31:54.070" style="s2">recorded from the sensor of the car</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:31:57.160" style="s2">together with the video data coming from</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.070" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">your phone and then we evoluted into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.160" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">product that you are currently selling</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.660" style="s2">which is called the chameleon it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:02.890" style="s2">smart dashcam</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.660" end="00:32:05.320" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you can install on</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.890" end="00:32:07.510" style="s2">the wishes of your car by default it</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.320" end="00:32:09.240" style="s2">provides a passive driver assistance</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.510" end="00:32:11.470" style="s2">features and with passive I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.240" end="00:32:14.230" style="s2">warnings so in the text if you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.470" end="00:32:15.970" style="s2">instructed it warns you if you are about</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.230" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">to collide and then of course it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:20.980" style="s2">provides all the functionality of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:23.470" style="s2">dashcam but at the same time is also a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.980" end="00:32:26.710" style="s2">completely open development platform</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.470" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">which can be coupled with our open</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.710" end="00:32:31.480" style="s2">source software which is called open</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:33.610" style="s2">pilot and so it does support open pilot</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.480" end="00:32:35.350" style="s2">and open pilot is the software that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.610" end="00:32:39.790" style="s2">show you before in the video that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.350" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">actually like drive your car I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.790" end="00:32:44.560" style="s2">think that you you might want to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.650" end="00:32:46.810" style="s2">consider about about data is I think if</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.560" end="00:32:50.530" style="s2">the cloud services is worth it like is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.810" end="00:32:52.510" style="s2">it worth storing storing your data on on</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.530" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">the cloud is definitely a good starting</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.510" end="00:32:58.510" style="s2">point which is where like we started as</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:33:01.900" style="s2">comma we we started to upload all our</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.510" end="00:33:03.340" style="s2">data on the cloud also cloud services</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.900" end="00:33:05.530" style="s2">like companies that provide cloud</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.340" end="00:33:05.970" style="s2">services are very good in giving you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.530" end="00:33:09.900" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.970" end="00:33:11.700" style="s2">sort of like intro grant where basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.900" end="00:33:13.860" style="s2">you basically use their service for free</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.700" end="00:33:15.900" style="s2">up to certain amount of expenses and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.860" end="00:33:18.330" style="s2">this is a great starting point but then</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.900" end="00:33:19.830" style="s2">as your user grows if you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.330" end="00:33:21.930" style="s2">have like a back-up plan or a way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.830" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">continue your cost you&#39;ll find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.930" end="00:33:26.700" style="s2">once you run out of the free money</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:29.610" style="s2">provided by the cloud service that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.700" end="00:33:32.040" style="s2">are going to spend after that a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.610" end="00:33:34.470" style="s2">high monthly cost because as I said your</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.040" end="00:33:36.450" style="s2">user grow is growing quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.470" end="00:33:37.350" style="s2">consider that keeping your data on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.450" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">cloud is actually a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.350" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">especially if you use your data for</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:43.650" style="s2">training and you want to stop like using</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:46.650" style="s2">for structure to transfer that around</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.650" end="00:33:47.700" style="s2">maybe actually transfer it luckily it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.650" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">a good solution and we definitely</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.700" end="00:33:50.700" style="s2">thought it was a good solution for us we</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">did the math</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.700" end="00:33:57.900" style="s2">buying our hard drives allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:33:59.640" style="s2">repay the cost of the cloud in about two</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.900" end="00:34:01.980" style="s2">months of course we don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.640" end="00:34:05.090" style="s2">redundancy that we have on the cloud but</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.980" end="00:34:08.220" style="s2">at the same time as I said before our</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.090" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">users keeps going and so for us there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.220" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">no much value in today&#39;s data there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:16.740" style="s2">more value in the ability of collecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:18.750" style="s2">new data select and upload only the data</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.740" end="00:34:20.550" style="s2">that you need currently a camera we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.750" end="00:34:22.650" style="s2">uploading all the data from users but</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:24.870" style="s2">will soon start to think about well</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.650" end="00:34:26.780" style="s2">maybe not all the data so relevant</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.870" end="00:34:29.850" style="s2">most of the data about driving is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.780" end="00:34:32.220" style="s2">somewhat boring it&#39;s about driving</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.850" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">straight on the highway and after you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.220" end="00:34:37.050" style="s2">have enough date of these maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.970" style="s2">don&#39;t need any more data and instead you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.050" end="00:34:40.770" style="s2">can select your own data based on</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.970" end="00:34:43.980" style="s2">certain criteria that you define at any</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.770" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">given time it could be for example any</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.980" end="00:34:48.270" style="s2">time that the user intervene any time</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:50.820" style="s2">that the user corrected the action of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.270" end="00:34:52.590" style="s2">your system is very interesting data</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.820" end="00:34:54.630" style="s2">because it means that somewhat your</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.590" end="00:34:57.300" style="s2">system failed to do something right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.630" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s useful data or maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.300" end="00:35:04.470" style="s2">turns or maybe adverse climate</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:06.750" style="s2">conditions etc and ultimately disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.470" end="00:35:09.030" style="s2">for some psychological reasons they</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.750" end="00:35:10.770" style="s2">companies tend to keep around data that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.030" end="00:35:14.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t use my recommendation is</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.770" end="00:35:16.920" style="s2">discarded in you de news as you progress</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.040" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">in your hardware you&#39;ll have legacy data</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.920" end="00:35:20.109" style="s2">legacy</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:22.990" style="s2">means data that you are not using it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.109" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">incompatible with newer data and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.990" end="00:35:26.289" style="s2">instead of keeping it around and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.220" style="s2">thinking maybe I will find a use of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.289" end="00:35:28.869" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.220" end="00:35:31.089" style="s2">think about that you are paying a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.869" end="00:35:33.430" style="s2">constantly a monthly fee for them and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.089" end="00:35:34.900" style="s2">maybe like a better idea is is discard</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.430" end="00:35:36.339" style="s2">data that you don&#39;t use don&#39;t keep that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:42.089" style="s2">around if you don&#39;t have a good use for</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.339" end="00:35:42.089" style="s2">them at any given time thank you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:48.470" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.060" end="00:36:05.550" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:32.780" style="s2">yeah definitely I think level level five</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:34.670" style="s2">cars anything the reason I need to call</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.780" end="00:36:36.500" style="s2">them level six I think level five car so</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.670" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">we actually be very similar to what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.500" end="00:36:39.650" style="s2">you described when they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.630" style="s2">applied I think a lot of it will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.650" end="00:36:45.500" style="s2">around like entertaining it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.630" end="00:36:48.740" style="s2">much like flying like the idea of giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.500" end="00:36:50.359" style="s2">entertainment to the driver I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.740" end="00:36:52.910" style="s2">start to see maybe I mean we see a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.359" end="00:36:55.609" style="s2">little bit of these like in cats when</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.910" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">you take a taxi you have some taxi you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.609" end="00:37:00.980" style="s2">have like like you can watch a video in</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">front of you and I definitely see this</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.980" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">way more like passenger center like</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">those like level five vehicles being</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:09.980" style="s2">deployed in this way I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.380" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s gonna be interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.980" end="00:37:13.700" style="s2">the first deployment of level four is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.380" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">probably gonna be retrofitting existing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.700" end="00:37:18.260" style="s2">cars building new cars is very hard</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">getting like the good reliability Zarda</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.260" end="00:37:22.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s a lot easier to retrofit</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:25.790" style="s2">existing existing models with with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.790" end="00:37:28.550" style="s2">other and there and the sensor that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.790" end="00:37:30.470" style="s2">need but then out like the technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.550" end="00:37:32.390" style="s2">progressed and I do believe that cars</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.470" end="00:37:35.619" style="s2">are going to be optimized around the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.390" end="00:37:41.260" style="s2">customer experience definitely I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.619" end="00:37:41.260" style="s2">we&#39;re out of time okay thank you</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.270" end="00:37:52.310" style="s2">chat so today over the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.330" end="00:37:53.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve been listening to experts talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.310" end="00:37:56.590" style="s2">about machine learning AI</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.690" end="00:37:58.850" style="s2">and applications to different industries</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.590" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">and I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed the sessions</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.850" end="00:38:03.170" style="s2">for the last few days now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:05.540" style="s2">kind of deep dive into autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.170" end="00:38:08.300" style="s2">vehicles um the hype and the impact in</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.540" end="00:38:09.800" style="s2">the industry and so I&#39;m going to let</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.300" end="00:38:12.410" style="s2">would you like to introduce yourself</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.810" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">come in 2016 and I&#39;m chief systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.590" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">architect and prior to come I worked at</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:30.590" style="s2">Tesla on the autopilot system and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">on the development of electric power</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.590" end="00:38:35.240" style="s2">trains and before that I worked on</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:37.060" style="s2">researching electric vehicles at the IU</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.240" end="00:38:42.380" style="s2">State University</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.060" end="00:38:44.390" style="s2">so autonomous vehicles and and automated</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.380" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">vehicles let&#39;s talk about let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.390" end="00:38:47.510" style="s2">out with definitions just level set and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.220" style="s2">I&#39;m sure some of y&#39;all were at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.510" end="00:38:52.610" style="s2">session this morning but for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.220" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">newcomers yeah I think a good way as I</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.610" end="00:38:56.300" style="s2">mentioned we have any presentation for</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:57.530" style="s2">the people that we rank here for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.300" end="00:39:00.700" style="s2">presentation it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.530" end="00:39:03.890" style="s2">distinguish between levels of automation</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.700" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">the sae defines the five different</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.890" end="00:39:12.080" style="s2">levels level 1 2 3 4 and 5 and level 1</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:13.880" style="s2">is pretty much like the car some assist</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.080" end="00:39:16.760" style="s2">the driver so the driver drives all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.880" end="00:39:19.550" style="s2">time but the car make makes intervention</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.760" end="00:39:22.250" style="s2">and makes driving safer and easier in</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.550" end="00:39:23.810" style="s2">level 2 because the car is full in</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.250" end="00:39:26.630" style="s2">control of driving and the driver</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.810" end="00:39:29.600" style="s2">actually assists the car and an example</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.630" end="00:39:32.990" style="s2">is Tesla Tesla vehicle GM supercruise</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.600" end="00:39:36.230" style="s2">and what we develop a comet the eye and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.990" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">then from level 3 and above the driver</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.230" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">is not responsible anymore</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:41.810" style="s2">the car is responsible for for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:43.400" style="s2">driving actions so the driver is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.810" end="00:39:46.520" style="s2">required to pay attention at all time</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.400" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">with level 3 the driver is only required</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.520" end="00:39:50.120" style="s2">to take control of the car after a few</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:51.380" style="s2">seconds of safe operation of the vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.120" end="00:39:54.350" style="s2">when the vehicle encounters a situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.380" end="00:39:56.780" style="s2">that cannot handle and then for 11 4 &amp; 5</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.350" end="00:39:59.750" style="s2">is driver is completely driverless</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.780" end="00:40:02.840" style="s2">vehicle and in level 4 is limited</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.750" end="00:40:05.510" style="s2">environment in level 5 is full full</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.840" end="00:40:07.430" style="s2">automation in unlimited environments so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.510" end="00:40:17.480" style="s2">basically making a robot that can drive</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.430" end="00:40:19.580" style="s2">as good as a human when when are they</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.480" end="00:40:21.700" style="s2">coming into the market yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.580" end="00:40:24.470" style="s2">a good question and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.700" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">certain certain levels of automation</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.470" end="00:40:30.650" style="s2">already here level level 1 is what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:31.790" style="s2">buy today if you buy a new car and in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.650" end="00:40:34.100" style="s2">you&#39;re on the new to your author like</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.790" end="00:40:36.860" style="s2">the most popular cars have 11:1</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.100" end="00:40:39.330" style="s2">automation a few cars on the market and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.860" end="00:40:42.260" style="s2">represent about the 0.2 percent</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.330" end="00:40:47.220" style="s2">the fleet today in us are level two</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.260" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2">mainly our test autopilot and then there</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.220" end="00:40:55.020" style="s2">is no like release the car in u.s. that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:57.780" style="s2">is like level 3 or above and so when</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.020" end="00:41:00.090" style="s2">when are those car comings when I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.780" end="00:41:01.590" style="s2">say first we should we should try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.090" end="00:41:03.840" style="s2">increase the number of cars on sublevel</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.590" end="00:41:05.670" style="s2">2 how do we make the existing cars like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.840" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">smarter how do we how do we make the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.670" end="00:41:09.510" style="s2">fleet how do we change the fleet</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:12.030" style="s2">incremental ii and i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.510" end="00:41:14.190" style="s2">natural like way that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.030" end="00:41:17.670" style="s2">change is cars are gonna transition from</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.190" end="00:41:19.710" style="s2">level 1 to level 2 and then when level 4</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.670" end="00:41:21.210" style="s2">level 3 4 &amp; 5 are gonna be applied well</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.710" end="00:41:23.430" style="s2">I would say like I would said before in</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.210" end="00:41:24.930" style="s2">the presentation I think one interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.430" end="00:41:27.120" style="s2">level that we should be paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.930" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">to is level 4 level 3 does not make much</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.120" end="00:41:30.600" style="s2">sense because solving for level 3 is</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:33.480" style="s2">pretty much as I have a solving for</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.600" end="00:41:36.660" style="s2">level 4 guaranteeing this certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.480" end="00:41:38.340" style="s2">of time of safe operation it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.660" end="00:41:40.680" style="s2">not simple task and solving for that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.340" end="00:41:42.750" style="s2">as our in my opinion solving for level 4</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.680" end="00:41:44.220" style="s2">so what what we are going to see at</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.750" end="00:41:46.110" style="s2">certain points is the deployment of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.220" end="00:41:49.560" style="s2">fleets that work in limited environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.110" end="00:41:51.330" style="s2">and with driverless vehicles that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.560" end="00:41:54.620" style="s2">bring you to point A to point B so</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.330" end="00:41:59.250" style="s2">hopefully we are going to see that in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.620" end="00:42:02.790" style="s2">the near future but these level 4 does</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.250" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">not compete with level 2 level 4 what</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.790" end="00:42:08.790" style="s2">level 4 aims to is the replacement of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:11.580" style="s2">existing services such as uber such as</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.790" end="00:42:14.100" style="s2">Poli transportation is just meant to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.580" end="00:42:19.700" style="s2">make those services cheaper by removing</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.100" end="00:42:22.620" style="s2">the driver from from the loop conference</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.700" end="00:42:24.270" style="s2">I work in the automotive aftermarket and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.620" end="00:42:26.310" style="s2">one of the things I do is I watch the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.270" end="00:42:28.620" style="s2">car park and watch how it&#39;s changing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.310" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">and how it&#39;s gonna be changing the next</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.620" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2">15 20 years to keep my company</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:37.560" style="s2">competitive so when I thought so od BC</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:39.300" style="s2">connectors oh we need two connectors</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.560" end="00:42:41.070" style="s2">those are the little you stick something</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.300" end="00:42:46.140" style="s2">under your dash used a lot for some</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.070" end="00:42:47.819" style="s2">basic diagnostic functions that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.140" end="00:42:49.859" style="s2">it&#39;s not smart enough that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.819" end="00:42:53.190" style="s2">connected and the right way to make it</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.859" end="00:42:56.220" style="s2">make my dumb car into a level 2 car no</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.190" end="00:42:59.130" style="s2">yeah so what we do at karma and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.220" end="00:43:01.319" style="s2">taking existing car so so proving that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.130" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">level 2 technology can be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.319" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">existing cars you can take any new cars</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:07.950" style="s2">to tell level 1 capability and we prove</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">the individual that I showed you a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.950" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">representation that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:15.510" style="s2">turn it into a level 2 car because a car</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:18.809" style="s2">that are new and comes out today have</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.510" end="00:43:20.220" style="s2">already backed waiters and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.809" end="00:43:22.980" style="s2">communicating of controlling that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.220" end="00:43:26.190" style="s2">waiters such as gas brake and steering</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.980" end="00:43:28.500" style="s2">in a way that you can actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.190" end="00:43:30.180" style="s2">car driving itself if it is marked</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.500" end="00:43:34.289" style="s2">enough it has the right software and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">then I compute so yeah I mean like if</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.289" end="00:43:41.519" style="s2">you the way that you interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:43.829" style="s2">car is tapping into the can system of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.519" end="00:43:46.710" style="s2">the car and it can be done through video</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.829" end="00:43:51.480" style="s2">pores or it can be done from any under</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.710" end="00:43:56.910" style="s2">and present in the car the technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.480" end="00:43:58.980" style="s2">needed to really hit the level 2016 well</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.910" end="00:44:00.599" style="s2">you eat the you need to do you need</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.980" end="00:44:02.549" style="s2">actuators you need they are the weather</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.599" end="00:44:05.430" style="s2">comes with the car be ready to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.549" end="00:44:09.349" style="s2">upgraded basically so you need pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.430" end="00:44:13.529" style="s2">much like a new car so from 2016 above</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.349" end="00:44:15.089" style="s2">but really in 2019 almost an in your car</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.529" end="00:44:16.769" style="s2">could be could be retrofitted way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.089" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">meet a level 2 in theory does anybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.769" end="00:44:22.710" style="s2">want to guess what percentage of the car</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:28.740" style="s2">park is 2016 and above anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.710" end="00:44:32.430" style="s2">brave you&#39;re pretty close it&#39;s 20% so</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.740" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">that also means that right now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.430" end="00:44:36.750" style="s2">lot of dumb cars on the road that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:38.819" style="s2">be able to have the full benefit of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.750" end="00:44:40.859" style="s2">know some aftermarket accessories</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.819" end="00:44:43.259" style="s2">there&#39;s still some programming you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.859" end="00:44:46.920" style="s2">do through there&#39;s lots of obd2 port</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.259" end="00:44:48.599" style="s2">platforms so for the novice car person</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.920" end="00:44:51.480" style="s2">who knows just enough Python to get in</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.599" end="00:44:53.609" style="s2">trouble and github x&#39; that can help you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.480" end="00:44:55.980" style="s2">get there but it doesn&#39;t take it quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.609" end="00:44:58.440" style="s2">to where it&#39;s the driver assist and have</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.980" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">the functionality to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.440" end="00:45:02.069" style="s2">if you want the car to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:03.660" style="s2">driving itself you need you need</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.069" end="00:45:08.130" style="s2">basically access to to that to eight</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.660" end="00:45:10.650" style="s2">hours so the age of the vehicles is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.130" end="00:45:12.150" style="s2">another thing that age of the car park</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.650" end="00:45:13.109" style="s2">has been something interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.150" end="00:45:14.579" style="s2">people in the aftermarket have been</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.109" end="00:45:16.650" style="s2">watching because people are holding on</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.579" end="00:45:19.020" style="s2">to cars way longer</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.650" end="00:45:22.589" style="s2">in 1996 the average age of the car who</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.020" end="00:45:24.119" style="s2">is eight point five years and you had</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.589" end="00:45:26.700" style="s2">you had it on the slide earlier just in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.119" end="00:45:29.730" style="s2">the the current age according to IHS of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.700" end="00:45:32.220" style="s2">an average car in America is eleven</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.730" end="00:45:35.460" style="s2">point seven years and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.220" end="00:45:38.369" style="s2">predicting to increase even when there</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.460" end="00:45:41.010" style="s2">have been movements like the cars cash</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.369" end="00:45:42.839" style="s2">for cars that only took six hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.010" end="00:45:46.440" style="s2">seventy thousand old cars off the roads</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.839" end="00:45:47.400" style="s2">so yep there&#39;s one challenge I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.440" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have is getting around</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.400" end="00:45:53.190" style="s2">those dumb cars well so definitely those</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">cars those cars like are gonna be around</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.190" end="00:45:58.470" style="s2">for a long time and it&#39;s highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">one important fact that is if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.470" end="00:46:02.250" style="s2">average life of car is about like to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:04.740" style="s2">to twelve years and it&#39;s actually like</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.250" end="00:46:07.470" style="s2">increasing over time there is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.740" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">this need of the coupling the hardware</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.470" end="00:46:11.880" style="s2">of the comes with the car so the car</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:14.760" style="s2">itself like the chassis actuators those</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.880" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">are not meant to last maybe fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.760" end="00:46:19.349" style="s2">years or more from the part from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:20.520" style="s2">brain of the car that should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.349" end="00:46:22.650" style="s2">something that instead we should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.520" end="00:46:23.730" style="s2">treating as consumer electronics should</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.650" end="00:46:25.619" style="s2">be something that we should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.730" end="00:46:29.279" style="s2">replace update and I&#39;m not talking just</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.619" end="00:46:32.549" style="s2">about software updates or software</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.279" end="00:46:34.109" style="s2">updates which none of the car that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.549" end="00:46:37.170" style="s2">today except for Tesla is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.109" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">doing it but I&#39;m also talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.170" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">being able to replace the computing</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:43.410" style="s2">hardware in the last fifteen years if</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.170" style="s2">you think about cars fifteen years ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.410" end="00:46:49.020" style="s2">and you think about cars today you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.170" end="00:46:50.849" style="s2">I I don&#39;t think it the perception of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.020" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">change of this car has been like so big</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.849" end="00:46:54.779" style="s2">like still has four wheels they cost</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:57.960" style="s2">pretty much about the same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.779" end="00:47:00.839" style="s2">money and they serve pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.960" end="00:47:04.349" style="s2">same purpose what&#39;s changed is the cost</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.839" end="00:47:06.059" style="s2">of computing particular like GPUs they</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.349" end="00:47:08.819" style="s2">reduce the cost of computing in the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.059" end="00:47:11.140" style="s2">fifteen years by Toyota of magnitude so</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.819" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">if ten thousand times cheaper has</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.140" end="00:47:15.190" style="s2">buying GPU so having the same computer</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">today that it was 15 years ago and so if</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.190" end="00:47:18.970" style="s2">you think about it well why I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">about cars that you buy today and think</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.970" end="00:47:24.190" style="s2">about them in 15 years from now how</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:26.140" style="s2">outdated they will feel an analogy that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.190" end="00:47:28.660" style="s2">I make it&#39;s like you are buying a house</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.140" end="00:47:29.590" style="s2">and you are not allowed to replace the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.660" end="00:47:32.170" style="s2">washing machine</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.590" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">that&#39;s how cars are going to feel when</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.170" end="00:47:36.100" style="s2">you buy them now and they are not</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.640" end="00:47:38.830" style="s2">structuring the capital in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.100" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">way so this is what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.830" end="00:47:45.100" style="s2">solve , we try to make a feasible key</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.820" end="00:47:47.140" style="s2">that can work with your existing car and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.100" end="00:47:48.550" style="s2">you treat it as a consumer electronic</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.140" end="00:47:50.260" style="s2">you treat that device that you install</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.550" end="00:47:52.270" style="s2">on the windshield connects with the can</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.260" end="00:47:54.340" style="s2">system of your car with something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.270" end="00:47:56.170" style="s2">after maybe every two years when a new</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.340" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">system comes out you can replace it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.170" end="00:48:00.460" style="s2">there is there is really no reason why</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:03.490" style="s2">you should replace the old car to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.460" end="00:48:05.050" style="s2">better driver system features and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.490" end="00:48:07.480" style="s2">also what we&#39;re seeing partnerships</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.050" end="00:48:08.950" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing large autumn automobile</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.480" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">manufacturers partner with different</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.950" end="00:48:12.250" style="s2">technology company to start treating the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.990" end="00:48:15.970" style="s2">technology in the car more like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.250" end="00:48:17.650" style="s2">consumer electronic and that way you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.970" end="00:48:18.970" style="s2">have that upgrade ability and as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.650" end="00:48:21.700" style="s2">mentioned before Tesla&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.970" end="00:48:23.860" style="s2">who does over-the-air update so it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.700" end="00:48:26.680" style="s2">require some you know handling and care</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.860" end="00:48:28.300" style="s2">to get the data updated but change in</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.680" end="00:48:31.000" style="s2">perspective like that is going to help</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.300" end="00:48:33.550" style="s2">treating it like the development cycle</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.000" end="00:48:35.110" style="s2">for electronics I think will help keep</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.550" end="00:48:36.910" style="s2">you happier when you have your eleven</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.110" end="00:48:42.630" style="s2">point seven year old car in a few years</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.910" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">yep let&#39;s see so issues with driverless</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.630" end="00:48:50.920" style="s2">you talked this morning about data</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:55.060" style="s2">collection is there how did how data</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.920" end="00:48:57.550" style="s2">collection using your tools so is that a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.060" end="00:49:00.250" style="s2">limitation still for three and four the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.550" end="00:49:02.890" style="s2">higher-end cars and commercial are there</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.250" end="00:49:04.750" style="s2">pictures available if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.890" end="00:49:07.510" style="s2">I mean commercial vehicles comes up to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.750" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">that was very yep lots of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.510" end="00:49:11.230" style="s2">magazine covers with being a fully</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:14.230" style="s2">electric 18 wheelers how close are we to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.230" end="00:49:15.430" style="s2">their well okay so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.230" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">distinction needs to be made between</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.430" end="00:49:21.730" style="s2">data collection that is made through</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:23.110" style="s2">like devices and product that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.730" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">current results so if you work on level</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.110" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">two like for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">Tesla tells us the ability of collecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:30.010" style="s2">everyday 4 million miles like they have</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:33.609" style="s2">enough car that everyday they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.010" end="00:49:35.799" style="s2">collect 4 million Minds a comma we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.609" end="00:49:38.890" style="s2">we are about thirty thousand miles per</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.799" end="00:49:40.839" style="s2">day that we can collect and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.890" end="00:49:42.700" style="s2">have a product that you actually sell it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.839" end="00:49:46.059" style="s2">becomes a lot easier to collect the data</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.700" end="00:49:47.619" style="s2">and you can actually be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.059" end="00:49:48.130" style="s2">spoiled by the amount of data that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.619" end="00:49:50.260" style="s2">can collect</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.130" end="00:49:51.730" style="s2">you can select you can decide which data</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.260" end="00:49:53.410" style="s2">to upload that you don&#39;t need to upload</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.730" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">all the data definitely test is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.410" end="00:49:58.569" style="s2">uploading four million lines of data</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:50:00.010" style="s2">every day so if you work on like level</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.569" end="00:50:04.180" style="s2">tree evolve on something that has not</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.010" end="00:50:06.609" style="s2">been released yet to the public then you</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.180" end="00:50:08.230" style="s2">cannot collect this data from from</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.609" end="00:50:10.630" style="s2">people from your device that are out in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.230" end="00:50:14.200" style="s2">the field but it&#39;s also important to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.630" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">distinguish between which type of data</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.200" end="00:50:18.039" style="s2">you can collect from people just driving</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.130" style="s2">a car which type of data you actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.039" end="00:50:23.140" style="s2">need from the car that you prepare that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.130" end="00:50:27.339" style="s2">are driving themselves so think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.140" end="00:50:30.190" style="s2">like a fleet of driving car like level 4</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.339" end="00:50:32.950" style="s2">well like if you are trying to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.190" end="00:50:36.460" style="s2">drive on data you can you can gather</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.950" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">this data from simply like people</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.460" end="00:50:39.339" style="s2">driving around they don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">driving with your own car you need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.339" end="00:50:42.970" style="s2">make sure that they have enough sensor</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:44.859" style="s2">and the sensor representative off of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.970" end="00:50:47.230" style="s2">car that you plant eventually to Elise</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.859" end="00:50:48.759" style="s2">for your for your final system but you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.230" end="00:50:50.140" style="s2">can distinguish between your fleet that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.759" end="00:50:51.660" style="s2">you use for testing to test your</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.140" end="00:50:54.609" style="s2">algorithm it that are driving themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.660" end="00:50:56.380" style="s2">versus the fleet that you just used for</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.609" end="00:50:58.049" style="s2">data collection so even if you are like</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.380" end="00:51:00.250" style="s2">working level for example in tracking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.049" end="00:51:01.750" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to have like self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.250" end="00:51:03.339" style="s2">tracking on the old in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.750" end="00:51:05.589" style="s2">to collect data from tracking you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.339" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">like retrofit existing tracking with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.589" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">right sensors and learn how to drive</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:13.059" style="s2">from manual from people that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.430" end="00:51:14.799" style="s2">actually driving just to stocks so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.059" end="00:51:17.230" style="s2">I think doing that distinction could</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.799" end="00:51:20.170" style="s2">help like getting into like the segment</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.230" end="00:51:23.799" style="s2">where it&#39;s a little are them to be like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.170" end="00:51:26.380" style="s2">big big networks and there&#39;s we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.799" end="00:51:28.440" style="s2">automation go into agriculture first and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.380" end="00:51:31.170" style="s2">see having a large area you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.440" end="00:51:32.760" style="s2">good opportunity for development know</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.170" end="00:51:36.030" style="s2">some software stuff is so needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.760" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">worked out yes right to repair culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.030" end="00:51:43.620" style="s2">is a great example of automation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:46.070" style="s2">easier than driving because the safety</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.620" end="00:51:48.570" style="s2">aspect of it is not is not like Samantha</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.070" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good example yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.570" end="00:51:56.910" style="s2">automation works and then we talked for</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:58.020" style="s2">the last few days about having the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.910" end="00:52:00.600" style="s2">kind of sample set</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.020" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2">how different are the videos and how</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.600" end="00:52:03.840" style="s2">applicable are the models from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:05.370" style="s2">different driving style so people in New</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.840" end="00:52:08.070" style="s2">York Drive very different than people</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.370" end="00:52:12.180" style="s2">here places like Georgia we have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.070" end="00:52:16.710" style="s2">long commute like Houston so what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.180" end="00:52:19.560" style="s2">their prioritization yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.710" end="00:52:21.810" style="s2">question so for level two like for what</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.560" end="00:52:23.310" style="s2">we do I mean with more variety we get</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.810" end="00:52:25.380" style="s2">from data the better we try to be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.310" end="00:52:27.170" style="s2">system is somewhat works decently in</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.380" end="00:52:29.850" style="s2">pretty much like every driving condition</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.170" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">if you try to build something like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.850" end="00:52:34.620" style="s2">fleet of level 4 vehicles I think you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:37.800" style="s2">should focus on your first application</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.620" end="00:52:39.420" style="s2">so if your first application is a system</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.800" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">that is going to service people like in</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.420" end="00:52:43.380" style="s2">a suburban place where like speed is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:47.490" style="s2">limited maybe like to 30 miles per 30 5</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.380" end="00:52:49.890" style="s2">miles per hour and like there is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.490" end="00:52:51.540" style="s2">like huge traffic then maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.890" end="00:52:53.580" style="s2">like focus on collecting data from those</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.540" end="00:52:56.250" style="s2">aisles because those represent your</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.580" end="00:52:58.860" style="s2">first like go to market application and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.250" end="00:53:01.740" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t try to some sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.860" end="00:53:04.110" style="s2">mixing with data that&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.740" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">environment that are outside the scope</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.110" end="00:53:09.210" style="s2">of the first release of your product so</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.630" end="00:53:10.410" style="s2">it really depends I would say like if</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.210" end="00:53:13.500" style="s2">you&#39;re focusing a level for now don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.410" end="00:53:15.090" style="s2">trying to get data from New York try to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.500" end="00:53:16.620" style="s2">try to focus on where where you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.090" end="00:53:18.540" style="s2">have your first application and it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.620" end="00:53:20.340" style="s2">going to be New York and we&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.540" end="00:53:22.740" style="s2">talked about the applicability of car</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.340" end="00:53:25.290" style="s2">videos being used for like larger Class</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.740" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">eight vehicles you know camera it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.290" end="00:53:30.420" style="s2">going to look different even for your</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:31.830" style="s2">modeling so that&#39;s a good thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.420" end="00:53:33.810" style="s2">a lot of data out there and micro</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.830" end="00:53:35.730" style="s2">processors have gotten cheap super</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.810" end="00:53:36.500" style="s2">although your cloud storage bill might</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.730" end="00:53:40.790" style="s2">go up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.500" end="00:53:45.050" style="s2">yes definitely like due to the sensors</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.790" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve super each output like a cameras</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.050" end="00:53:46.760" style="s2">like you think about the stream of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.119" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.760" end="00:53:52.069" style="s2">it&#39;s like mega mega mega pixels and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.119" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">think about how much data that is sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.069" end="00:53:56.300" style="s2">you can compress your video but still</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:54:00.170" style="s2">like we are talking about i mean in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.300" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">case like our device collects pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.170" end="00:54:05.630" style="s2">much between 5 and gigabytes of data per</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.200" end="00:54:06.680" style="s2">hour if you talk about like level 4 you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.630" end="00:54:09.500" style="s2">are probably talking about like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.680" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">gigabyte per hour collected by your</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.500" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">system and so yes I mean like processing</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:18.770" style="s2">this data becomes like feasible now on</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:19.910" style="s2">like real time but at the same time if</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.770" end="00:54:22.099" style="s2">you&#39;re storing this data you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.910" end="00:54:24.680" style="s2">think about how expensive is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.099" end="00:54:26.930" style="s2">your your storage bill when you are like</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.680" end="00:54:31.130" style="s2">uploading all these data to your to your</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:33.410" style="s2">servers you know how can you know if</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.130" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in in working with you</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.410" end="00:54:38.869" style="s2">know autonomous vehicles and car tech</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:40.670" style="s2">the the problem presents a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.869" end="00:54:43.579" style="s2">opportunity for developing new models</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.670" end="00:54:45.170" style="s2">for we saw some models for that the our</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.579" end="00:54:48.190" style="s2">CNN with picture refinement and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.170" end="00:54:50.810" style="s2">different ways to classify images so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.190" end="00:54:53.630" style="s2">you&#39;re closer to it so you know how are</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.810" end="00:54:55.010" style="s2">different ways to get in to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.630" end="00:54:57.530" style="s2">or the other development opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.010" end="00:55:02.030" style="s2">that aren&#39;t necessarily in the card type</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.530" end="00:55:04.670" style="s2">you know yeah well so self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.030" end="00:55:09.079" style="s2">are mainly like a software problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.670" end="00:55:11.540" style="s2">not really a problem that has been some</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.079" end="00:55:13.880" style="s2">sort of like I see solved I and I see it</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.540" end="00:55:15.770" style="s2">like I really frame it as a software as</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.880" end="00:55:18.740" style="s2">a possible problem how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.770" end="00:55:20.780" style="s2">make like a robot that they can drive as</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.740" end="00:55:23.300" style="s2">human or can at least like assist human</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.780" end="00:55:25.970" style="s2">driving so yeah you don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.300" end="00:55:28.250" style="s2">caressed better to be involved you need</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.970" end="00:55:30.380" style="s2">amino free to have like passion for for</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.250" end="00:55:32.710" style="s2">software and that there are like many</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">aspects of it you can you can work on</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.710" end="00:55:36.770" style="s2">machine learning you can work on</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:39.109" style="s2">planning controls that management</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.770" end="00:55:43.069" style="s2">infrastructure there are really really a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.109" end="00:55:45.319" style="s2">lot of aspect about it that people like</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.069" end="00:55:46.609" style="s2">engineers can can get can getting ball</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.319" end="00:55:48.410" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.609" end="00:55:50.810" style="s2">I mean if somebody&#39;s interested into</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.410" end="00:55:54.020" style="s2">into getting more involved about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.810" end="00:55:56.360" style="s2">we have like all our software it&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.020" end="00:55:58.340" style="s2">source like comedy I makes all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.360" end="00:56:01.340" style="s2">software open source it&#39;s called open</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.340" end="00:56:03.350" style="s2">pilot you can go and get add you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.340" end="00:56:05.660" style="s2">read the application you can read the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.350" end="00:56:08.930" style="s2">how our software start works and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.660" end="00:56:11.000" style="s2">software is software that supports the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.930" end="00:56:13.370" style="s2">Arbour that we sell which is called the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.000" end="00:56:16.430" style="s2">comedy khmer on so the other that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.370" end="00:56:18.230" style="s2">sell is a smart dash cam and if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.430" end="00:56:19.880" style="s2">you&#39;re interested into being like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.230" end="00:56:21.530" style="s2">developer and learning more about</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.880" end="00:56:23.530" style="s2">solving car so you can actually put the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.530" end="00:56:26.300" style="s2">two things together and you can have</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.530" end="00:56:27.500" style="s2">like a level to retrofit that cell</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.300" end="00:56:31.100" style="s2">driving car which is the one that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.500" end="00:56:33.560" style="s2">showed in the video and everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.100" end="00:56:35.810" style="s2">imagine the the adjacent industries and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.560" end="00:56:38.360" style="s2">even the service industries as people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.810" end="00:56:41.240" style="s2">mobility patterns and habits changed</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.360" end="00:56:42.770" style="s2">they&#39;ve already changed first with lift</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.240" end="00:56:46.310" style="s2">and now you can get anything delivered</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.770" end="00:56:47.930" style="s2">to your house so that opens up as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.310" end="00:56:52.150" style="s2">talking fleet slates have come up a few</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.930" end="00:56:54.380" style="s2">times either how could your business be</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.150" end="00:56:57.800" style="s2">changed by it is there some different</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.380" end="00:56:59.990" style="s2">model that we&#39;re seeing you know be</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.800" end="00:57:01.580" style="s2">thinking of this when thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.990" end="00:57:04.190" style="s2">tongue which I&#39;m sure everybody has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.580" end="00:57:06.680" style="s2">thinking of it to be it the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.190" end="00:57:09.320" style="s2">autonomous vehicles to your business but</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.680" end="00:57:11.710" style="s2">fleets and adjacent services are</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.320" end="00:57:13.910" style="s2">interesting the utilization rate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.710" end="00:57:15.560" style="s2">yeah definitely they want one good thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.910" end="00:57:17.630" style="s2">about the Thomas vague like driverless</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.560" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">vehicle is that they respected like</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.630" end="00:57:21.530" style="s2">utility sure it is gonna be much higher</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:22.970" style="s2">than any of the car existing which we</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.530" end="00:57:26.210" style="s2">really think about like the trucking</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.970" end="00:57:29.120" style="s2">industry the trucking industry when when</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.210" end="00:57:29.570" style="s2">we are gonna see 11 4 trucks on their</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.120" end="00:57:31.160" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.570" end="00:57:32.690" style="s2">well tracking is going to become like</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.160" end="00:57:33.980" style="s2">radically different because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.690" end="00:57:35.930" style="s2">gonna be any more constrained by the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.980" end="00:57:38.270" style="s2">maximum I think it&#39;s eight hours like</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.930" end="00:57:40.250" style="s2">maximum continues driving from from</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.270" end="00:57:42.020" style="s2">driver so you can have those trucks like</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.250" end="00:57:44.900" style="s2">driving pretty much like no staff but</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.020" end="00:57:48.470" style="s2">for for as long as it takes to go from</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.900" end="00:57:51.290" style="s2">point A to point B and so yeah certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.470" end="00:57:53.120" style="s2">industries and I really look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.290" end="00:57:55.130" style="s2">tracking industries are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.120" end="00:57:57.620" style="s2">radically changed by a for example you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.130" end="00:58:00.820" style="s2">to musicians right other things are</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.620" end="00:58:01.900" style="s2">gonna change I would expect like</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.820" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">the first application I&#39;ll add before</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.900" end="00:58:08.500" style="s2">being I there is gonna be a company that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">owns the fleet like I do really see</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.500" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">especially because at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:12.070" style="s2">there is gonna be a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:13.810" style="s2">iterations like on they are on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.070" end="00:58:16.150" style="s2">services of the maintenance there are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.810" end="00:58:18.100" style="s2">lot of like unknowns and so I do see</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.150" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">making sense that there is gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.100" end="00:58:24.250" style="s2">a company that owns the fleet as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:26.320" style="s2">a little as opposed to what we see today</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.250" end="00:58:29.080" style="s2">with uber drivers where it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.320" end="00:58:31.030" style="s2">distributed single drivers that own</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.080" end="00:58:33.640" style="s2">their car and contribute to the fleet</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.030" end="00:58:35.920" style="s2">instead I rather see those fleet being</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.640" end="00:58:37.950" style="s2">directly managed and central is the by</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.920" end="00:58:41.350" style="s2">the company that provides the service</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.950" end="00:58:44.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s upgrading is a bigger deal with</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.350" end="00:58:47.320" style="s2">the these smarter cars getting software</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.710" end="00:58:49.570" style="s2">updates and good have to happen fleet</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.320" end="00:58:51.460" style="s2">management makes more sense and that can</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.570" end="00:58:54.220" style="s2">make a lot of sense in that context yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.460" end="00:58:56.680" style="s2">exactly what I was mentioning like there</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.220" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">is this need of being like closely</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.680" end="00:59:00.670" style="s2">connected with your fleet being able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:02.680" style="s2">upgrade your car so and especially like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.670" end="00:59:03.820" style="s2">at the beginning so definitely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.680" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">gonna be like the first implementation</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.820" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be like our own fleet does</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:12.940" style="s2">anybody know the utilization rate for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:14.410" style="s2">consumer car unless you&#39;re like an uber</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.940" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">driver because that&#39;s or you know in</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.410" end="00:59:18.730" style="s2">your car yeah I&#39;ve heard you end up not</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:21.100" style="s2">using your car its parts around 90</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.730" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">percent of the time whereas you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.100" end="00:59:27.130" style="s2">of flip that model with an autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:28.570" style="s2">vehicle in delivery services you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.130" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">have like at last mile issues you</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.570" end="00:59:32.320" style="s2">actually might need to have a human</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">doing some interaction but again you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.320" end="00:59:35.800" style="s2">know looking for ways you can interact</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.240" end="00:59:38.830" style="s2">with this new vendor industry that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.800" end="00:59:40.030" style="s2">that is something if there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.830" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">driver in the car how would your</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.030" end="00:59:44.500" style="s2">business work with them and serve them</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:48.610" style="s2">so would that change anything any aspect</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.500" end="00:59:55.360" style="s2">of what you&#39;re doing now let&#39;s see how</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.610" end="00:59:57.700" style="s2">about consumer adoption of babies well</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.360" end="00:59:59.620" style="s2">so okay if we talk about level two it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.700" end="01:00:01.810" style="s2">really something there it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.620" end="01:00:04.150" style="s2">convey so you just I just have an idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.810" end="01:00:07.720" style="s2">like how many of you have been in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.150" end="01:00:11.260" style="s2">level to sell driving car like raise</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.720" end="01:00:12.510" style="s2">your hand if you have been why I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.260" end="01:00:15.090" style="s2">say it&#39;s like temperature</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.510" end="01:00:18.540" style="s2">10% of you have been like in 11 - well</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.090" end="01:00:22.290" style="s2">consider that there are 0.2% of cars 11</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.540" end="01:00:23.820" style="s2">- on the road today so 10% yeah you this</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.290" end="01:00:26.609" style="s2">audience definitely got a good exposure</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.820" end="01:00:28.230" style="s2">to them and it&#39;s something that you need</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.609" end="01:00:31.109" style="s2">to experience you need to realize how</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.230" end="01:00:34.530" style="s2">better your driving can be and how safe</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.109" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">it can be because you are basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.530" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">relieved by the stress of constantly</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">having to interact with your car making</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:42.570" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re keeping the proper</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:44.310" style="s2">distance with the car ahead of you also</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.570" end="01:00:45.869" style="s2">a car drives itself as a much shorter</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.310" end="01:00:47.220" style="s2">reaction time because like you have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.869" end="01:00:48.869" style="s2">computer like watching the road and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.220" end="01:00:50.430" style="s2">taking actions and then at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.869" end="01:00:52.350" style="s2">you have a monitoring system it</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.430" end="01:00:55.500" style="s2">constantly reminds that you have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.350" end="01:00:57.750" style="s2">attention and I mean it&#39;s debated there</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.500" end="01:00:59.790" style="s2">are certain I mean there are voices that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.750" end="01:01:01.380" style="s2">say this is actually going to be harder</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.790" end="01:01:03.210" style="s2">to manage from the driver because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.380" end="01:01:05.609" style="s2">gonna push people to get more distracted</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.210" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve been driving these systems I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.609" end="01:01:09.240" style="s2">been developing this system and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:11.910" style="s2">everybody that I talk to that has been</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.240" end="01:01:13.950" style="s2">like an elaborate systems as a political</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.910" end="01:01:16.109" style="s2">opinion about how level-2 can actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.950" end="01:01:17.850" style="s2">like improve people&#39;s people striving so</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.109" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">I think it&#39;s something like the man will</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.850" end="01:01:22.440" style="s2">grow as the offer will grow as more and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.300" style="s2">more cars we pushed or three would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.440" end="01:01:25.950" style="s2">will be keeping level two systems I</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.300" end="01:01:29.490" style="s2">think the acceptance rate is going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.950" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">grow as a consequence I would say for</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.490" end="01:01:35.250" style="s2">eleventh for I I think it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:35.850" style="s2">literally like a question of costs as I</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.250" end="01:01:38.520" style="s2">said before</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.850" end="01:01:40.020" style="s2">11400 really exists and you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.520" end="01:01:41.550" style="s2">be driven from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.020" end="01:01:44.460" style="s2">without having to drive it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.550" end="01:01:46.470" style="s2">matter of can I offer something that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.460" end="01:01:48.990" style="s2">like practical can bring it up from</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.470" end="01:01:52.500" style="s2">point A to point B we eventually same</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.990" end="01:01:54.780" style="s2">amount or less time and the same cost or</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.500" end="01:01:57.750" style="s2">less if that&#39;s true then acceptance rate</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.780" end="01:02:00.090" style="s2">or like level four it&#39;s gonna be is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.750" end="01:02:02.730" style="s2">gonna be mad it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.090" end="01:02:04.500" style="s2">happen otherwise they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.730" end="01:02:06.420" style="s2">succeed and it&#39;s not populace that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.500" end="01:02:09.780" style="s2">gonna be the case definitely I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.420" end="01:02:11.850" style="s2">it being the case for quite a bit so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.780" end="01:02:13.859" style="s2">National Highway Transportation Safety</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.850" end="01:02:15.330" style="s2">Administration has been a proponent of</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.859" end="01:02:17.369" style="s2">some of these these driver assist</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.330" end="01:02:21.000" style="s2">because they save lives like the safer</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.369" end="01:02:23.070" style="s2">you can make cars I think that helps me</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.000" end="01:02:23.820" style="s2">work through acceptance of like letting</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.070" end="01:02:25.530" style="s2">my</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:35.070" style="s2">happen when people are not paying</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.120" end="01:02:37.620" style="s2">attention so I think that&#39;s gonna help</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.070" end="01:02:39.330" style="s2">be at least a driver for it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.620" end="01:02:42.330" style="s2">definitely a messaging what he needs to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.330" end="01:02:44.100" style="s2">do definitely I did the safety aspect is</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.330" end="01:02:45.570" style="s2">very important I think there is a huge</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.100" end="01:02:47.550" style="s2">opportunity for level truth to make a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.570" end="01:02:51.180" style="s2">car safer that the starting point is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.550" end="01:02:53.100" style="s2">greater like Fattal accidents are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.180" end="01:02:56.970" style="s2">number one cause of death among young</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.100" end="01:02:58.590" style="s2">people between age 16 and 24 and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.970" end="01:03:01.650" style="s2">represent about like two percent because</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.590" end="01:03:03.450" style="s2">of death worldwide so there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.650" end="01:03:07.110" style="s2">a big opportunity there to make a car</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.450" end="01:03:10.380" style="s2">safer and smarter regarding 11-4 there</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.110" end="01:03:12.570" style="s2">is a little bit like nah I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.380" end="01:03:14.280" style="s2">like unfair comparison when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.570" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">about safety related to level four</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.280" end="01:03:19.890" style="s2">because what what one of the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:21.930" style="s2">is being said when when you people like</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.890" end="01:03:24.270" style="s2">talked about that before is oh well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.930" end="01:03:28.230" style="s2">gonna be a lot safer but again you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.270" end="01:03:29.700" style="s2">have to compare 11 4 with like you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.230" end="01:03:31.620" style="s2">driving the car you have to compare</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.700" end="01:03:34.140" style="s2">level 4 with the services it&#39;s level Pro</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.620" end="01:03:36.990" style="s2">compete with which is public</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.140" end="01:03:39.570" style="s2">transportation which is the driver which</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.990" end="01:03:41.940" style="s2">if you take aware I would say it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.570" end="01:03:43.800" style="s2">like another of magnitude safer then you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.940" end="01:03:45.690" style="s2">drive your car if anything because is</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.800" end="01:03:47.370" style="s2">offering your service and is paying more</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.690" end="01:03:50.460" style="s2">attention that if you weren&#39;t in the car</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.370" end="01:03:51.990" style="s2">so when you talk about safety for level</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.460" end="01:03:53.640" style="s2">4 you need to contesta lies it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.990" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">comparable to a poll which I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.640" end="01:03:58.800" style="s2">it done like very often while in level 2</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:04.680" style="s2">well you need to be better than people</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.800" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">to have in the car after is earlier yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.680" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">great question I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.140" end="01:04:18.310" style="s2">see any potential for complacency on if</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.120" end="01:04:21.190" style="s2">you&#39;re at level two for too long before</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.310" end="01:04:23.710" style="s2">technology hits level four does the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.190" end="01:04:25.590" style="s2">average driver out there that&#39;s tweeting</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.710" end="01:04:27.940" style="s2">looking at Facebook on their computers</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.590" end="01:04:29.620" style="s2">become complacent and get distracted you</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.940" end="01:04:31.900" style="s2">see accident rates going higher than you</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.620" end="01:04:34.030" style="s2">anticipate it&#39;s currently level two</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.900" end="01:04:35.530" style="s2">drivers they know they&#39;re in a test law</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.030" end="01:04:38.860" style="s2">they know they&#39;re supposed to be in</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.530" end="01:04:40.750" style="s2">acting so they&#39;re participating more if</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.860" end="01:04:44.410" style="s2">the lag between level two and level four</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.750" end="01:04:46.330" style="s2">is years do you see that people will</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.410" end="01:04:48.580" style="s2">trust too much in the increase in</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.330" end="01:04:51.190" style="s2">accident rates no I think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.580" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">going the other way around I think like</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:54.700" style="s2">people that get into level two cars</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:56.350" style="s2">today are more confused about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.700" end="01:04:57.700" style="s2">technology probably are not completely</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.350" end="01:05:01.150" style="s2">aware of the technology one thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.700" end="01:05:03.010" style="s2">I wish Tesla was doing that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.150" end="01:05:05.230" style="s2">and actually we do is driver monitoring</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.010" end="01:05:06.700" style="s2">so how do we actually be monitor that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.230" end="01:05:09.160" style="s2">the driver is paying attention that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.700" end="01:05:11.260" style="s2">good way to like educate on this part</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.160" end="01:05:13.030" style="s2">about what&#39;s the proper behavior to take</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.260" end="01:05:15.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re on a level 2 car you have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.030" end="01:05:17.890" style="s2">pay attention and yeah I mean if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.880" end="01:05:20.410" style="s2">have like camera watching the driver Jen</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.890" end="01:05:21.730" style="s2">does that once with supercruise there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.410" end="01:05:24.970" style="s2">like a video camera an infrared camera</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.730" end="01:05:26.740" style="s2">that looks at you and can tell you if</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.970" end="01:05:28.360" style="s2">you start and we do the same thing and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.740" end="01:05:29.770" style="s2">think this is very important so as we</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.360" end="01:05:31.870" style="s2">move forward I think there will be as</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.770" end="01:05:34.780" style="s2">the acceptance and understanding of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.870" end="01:05:35.950" style="s2">leverage system is I think like drivers</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.780" end="01:05:41.440" style="s2">and users will be better educated</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.950" end="01:05:43.330" style="s2">because they understand what so no I</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.440" end="01:05:45.280" style="s2">don&#39;t I I expect that over time things</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.330" end="01:05:46.630" style="s2">are actually gonna get things people are</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.280" end="01:05:48.550" style="s2">gonna be better educated than they</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.630" end="01:05:49.570" style="s2">currently are and not to be punitive</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.550" end="01:05:52.060" style="s2">that I think the other thing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.570" end="01:05:53.590" style="s2">naturally comes from that as the drivers</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.060" end="01:05:55.030" style="s2">are monitors you know that would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.590" end="01:05:57.790" style="s2">introduced as evidence in a court case</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.030" end="01:05:59.290" style="s2">at some point so I think knowing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.790" end="01:06:01.450" style="s2">you have a camera on you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.290" end="01:06:03.940" style="s2">also will affect you know your</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.450" end="01:06:07.210" style="s2">interaction with it not just you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.940" end="01:06:10.030" style="s2">fall asleep on the 405 hopefully well I</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.210" end="01:06:11.410" style="s2">mean yeah I mean it really depends like</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.030" end="01:06:13.480" style="s2">I&#39;m currently done we don&#39;t collect</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.410" end="01:06:14.890" style="s2">people&#39;s people&#39;s face unless they</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.480" end="01:06:16.510" style="s2">consent to and they Yelp I was like</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.890" end="01:06:19.050" style="s2">training driver monitoring models</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.510" end="01:06:21.810" style="s2">somebody needs to actively</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.050" end="01:06:24.180" style="s2">santé to be able to for us to record</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.810" end="01:06:26.850" style="s2">their data otherwise we just provide the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.180" end="01:06:34.650" style="s2">feature but we now record the data but</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.850" end="01:06:37.290" style="s2">yes definitely yes okay so I hope I can</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.650" end="01:06:41.160" style="s2">ask this question properly but if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.290" end="01:06:42.750" style="s2">Ford and what how will I be adopting all</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.160" end="01:06:44.310" style="s2">of this so what will it look like so</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.750" end="01:06:46.410" style="s2">you&#39;re saying today Tesla is the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.310" end="01:06:49.650" style="s2">company that has this software update</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.410" end="01:06:53.220" style="s2">well all cars have that what will Ford</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.650" end="01:06:55.230" style="s2">be doing over the next 10 years what</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.220" end="01:06:57.960" style="s2">will their production look like to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.230" end="01:07:01.670" style="s2">able to start adopting this what do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.960" end="01:07:05.310" style="s2">think I can say because I I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.670" end="01:07:07.350" style="s2">industry so and I&#39;ve seen Toyota&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.310" end="01:07:10.110" style="s2">doing partnerships with uber on both</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.350" end="01:07:13.290" style="s2">autonomous TVs and retrofitting like</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.110" end="01:07:16.410" style="s2">Siena&#39;s so like a regular internal</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.290" end="01:07:17.820" style="s2">combustion engine cars and what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.410" end="01:07:19.530" style="s2">seeing evidence of is they&#39;re hedging</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.820" end="01:07:21.570" style="s2">their bets it might move this way it</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.530" end="01:07:23.790" style="s2">might go way more electric you know is</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.570" end="01:07:27.000" style="s2">the supply chain to support you know a</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.790" end="01:07:29.430" style="s2">more electric car part in place but they</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.000" end="01:07:31.380" style="s2">they have for years although they might</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.430" end="01:07:35.340" style="s2">not be on the road there they are doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.380" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">R&amp;D and and I&#39;m not just saying for Ford</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.340" end="01:07:38.460" style="s2">I&#39;m saying in general for the car</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:40.800" style="s2">manufacturers we&#39;re seeing them partner</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.460" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">there they&#39;ve started forming alliances</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.800" end="01:07:44.850" style="s2">you can start seeing different clusters</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:48.120" style="s2">of ones that are working with others so</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.850" end="01:07:50.610" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they have the full answer</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.120" end="01:07:52.980" style="s2">yet but at least we were level four for</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.610" end="01:07:55.740" style="s2">the different levels of development they</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.980" end="01:07:57.540" style="s2">have been investing money in that so</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.740" end="01:07:58.530" style="s2">yeah then we let us see it like I I</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.540" end="01:08:00.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they are waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.530" end="01:08:03.540" style="s2">officially because I mean if you think</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.510" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">about that like for software Ricola</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.540" end="01:08:06.660" style="s2">they have like let&#39;s say you have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:08.760" style="s2">software glitch and a tap and it have</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.660" end="01:08:10.470" style="s2">been lagging Toyota&#39;s like several times</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.760" end="01:08:12.450" style="s2">I compress right so you have the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.470" end="01:08:15.060" style="s2">software Ricola and the software recall</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.450" end="01:08:16.890" style="s2">you have to recall millions of cars how</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.060" end="01:08:18.839" style="s2">much of a cost is that like quantifies</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.890" end="01:08:20.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s like hundreds of millions if</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.839" end="01:08:22.859" style="s2">you have to recall like millions of cars</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.870" end="01:08:24.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the equivalent of money that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.859" end="01:08:25.830" style="s2">have to spend for software update and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.390" end="01:08:27.450" style="s2">then also like the development cycle</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.830" end="01:08:30.330" style="s2">your learning cycle is much longer right</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.450" end="01:08:32.100" style="s2">so you I mean when you&#39;re at least like</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.330" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">the fact that you can do so over here</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.100" end="01:08:34.219" style="s2">update does</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:36.440" style="s2">mean that what you learn is isn&#39;t safe</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.219" end="01:08:38.569" style="s2">right so you need to work out the safety</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.440" end="01:08:40.519" style="s2">part of your software before you release</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.569" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">it and that part doesn&#39;t change but then</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.519" end="01:08:45.049" style="s2">I would say there is like an extra</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:47.059" style="s2">probably 70% that is just like user</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.049" end="01:08:49.339" style="s2">interface things that are not safety</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.059" end="01:08:50.779" style="s2">critical that if there is a glitch is</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.339" end="01:08:53.389" style="s2">not the end of the war that you can work</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.779" end="01:08:54.859" style="s2">out those making updates over the air so</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.389" end="01:08:57.799" style="s2">how much shorter will the different</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.859" end="01:09:00.650" style="s2">cycle be if you don&#39;t need like to test</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.799" end="01:09:03.170" style="s2">for so many hours the fact that if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.650" end="01:09:05.690" style="s2">click a button the the proper answer on</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.170" end="01:09:06.769" style="s2">UI happens right for example so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.690" end="01:09:07.099" style="s2">need to understand what they&#39;re waiting</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.769" end="01:09:10.609" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.099" end="01:09:13.009" style="s2">but the actual answer is I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.609" end="01:09:15.529" style="s2">this company is very good at making cars</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.009" end="01:09:16.999" style="s2">making reliable cars they have a little</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.529" end="01:09:21.139" style="s2">B to invent themselves if they want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.999" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">be up to date wait we sort of problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.139" end="01:09:24.819" style="s2">it&#39;s an infrastructure problem that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:26.869" style="s2">have to build and it&#39;s something new so</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.819" end="01:09:28.699" style="s2">but there you have to do it if they want</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.869" end="01:09:31.099" style="s2">to be relevant if they want to survive</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.699" end="01:09:32.269" style="s2">they have to get in today so that why</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.099" end="01:09:33.469" style="s2">it&#39;s like there is no way to compete</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.269" end="01:09:35.329" style="s2">with the other companies that actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.469" end="01:09:37.069" style="s2">are making this a possibility there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.329" end="01:09:44.269" style="s2">like there&#39;s a huge cost opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.069" end="01:09:46.309" style="s2">there there&#39;s a lot of value and people</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.269" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">doing what they excel at companies too</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.309" end="01:09:51.019" style="s2">so if you&#39;re awesome at making cars you</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:55.460" style="s2">know partner with people who are awesome</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.019" end="01:09:57.349" style="s2">at the technology problem Karl yeah just</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.460" end="01:09:59.059" style="s2">I want to return back to this the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.349" end="01:10:00.650" style="s2">concept of safety as you move through</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.059" end="01:10:03.409" style="s2">the different levels here you talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.650" end="01:10:06.679" style="s2">extensively about that what are some of</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.409" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">the the AI approaches that are being</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.679" end="01:10:12.729" style="s2">developed to address adversarial type of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:16.219" style="s2">threats to smart vehicles for example I</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.729" end="01:10:18.229" style="s2">you know you can have like obstruction</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.219" end="01:10:19.010" style="s2">of signage for example and trick a</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.229" end="01:10:20.869" style="s2">vehicle</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.010" end="01:10:23.239" style="s2">thinking that oh that&#39;s not a stop sign</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.869" end="01:10:25.639" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna go right by so what are</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.239" end="01:10:28.340" style="s2">some of the solutions in the AI space</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.639" end="01:10:30.229" style="s2">that is being explored to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.340" end="01:10:32.809" style="s2">as you move through those levels yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.229" end="01:10:35.570" style="s2">about time is it that these vehicles are</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.809" end="01:10:39.320" style="s2">getting smarter and not so susceptible</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.570" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">to tricks and adversarial tax definitely</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.320" end="01:10:44.540" style="s2">so I mean like the problem gets a lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:46.790" style="s2">easier the more mice you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.540" end="01:10:49.010" style="s2">collect because you have the choice of</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.790" end="01:10:50.840" style="s2">deciding which which they thought a</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.010" end="01:10:53.330" style="s2">favor so for example like as a show</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.840" end="01:10:55.460" style="s2">during the presentation the large</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.330" end="01:10:57.590" style="s2">majority of data you collect from from</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.460" end="01:10:58.970" style="s2">cars so if you don distinguish the one</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.590" end="01:11:00.230" style="s2">that is good anyone that is did one that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.970" end="01:11:02.030" style="s2">is use from the one is not is like</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.230" end="01:11:04.280" style="s2">boring data it&#39;s like you driving on</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.030" end="01:11:07.070" style="s2">there is not much to learn after certain</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.280" end="01:11:09.140" style="s2">point and so yes you need to favor those</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.070" end="01:11:11.420" style="s2">events that are somewhat events from</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.140" end="01:11:14.150" style="s2">which you can learn so like having a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.420" end="01:11:16.610" style="s2">horror mystery Bhushan of your data that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.150" end="01:11:18.710" style="s2">are represented by by specific events</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.610" end="01:11:20.030" style="s2">from which you can learn and you can do</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.710" end="01:11:22.640" style="s2">that in many ways like one way that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.030" end="01:11:24.530" style="s2">can do it is like mark every</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.640" end="01:11:26.390" style="s2">intervention that the try like if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.530" end="01:11:27.620" style="s2">have your system that is like a level</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.390" end="01:11:29.840" style="s2">two system every time that the user</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.620" end="01:11:31.130" style="s2">intervenes to correct the car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.840" end="01:11:32.660" style="s2">somewhat like a disengagement is</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.130" end="01:11:34.190" style="s2">somewhat like something that they can be</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.660" end="01:11:36.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t do right and so you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.190" end="01:11:39.700" style="s2">collect those event in favor of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.320" end="01:11:41.570" style="s2">events to learn something specific that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.700" end="01:11:43.430" style="s2">well so the first one learning is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.570" end="01:11:44.990" style="s2">little bit yes when first learning well</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.430" end="01:11:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s important if a like a personal</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.990" end="01:11:49.670" style="s2">learning in the sense that you deploy</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.640" end="01:11:53.180" style="s2">something and you use like the user as</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.670" end="01:11:55.610" style="s2">so sort of like your feedback there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.180" end="01:11:57.380" style="s2">some sort of like ethical aspect to it</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.610" end="01:11:59.030" style="s2">that should be you can see that because</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.380" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">you&#39;re using like the user as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.030" end="01:12:03.800" style="s2">like reinforcement loop but in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:05.390" style="s2">sense it&#39;s fair to do it as long as like</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.800" end="01:12:07.130" style="s2">what you released at any given time is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.390" end="01:12:08.420" style="s2">safe no more interesting like you can do</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.130" end="01:12:09.890" style="s2">it for smell owning like completely like</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.420" end="01:12:11.540" style="s2">offline so you can you can train your</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.890" end="01:12:13.730" style="s2">model planner a personal learning so you</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.540" end="01:12:17.000" style="s2">tap you set up like a simulator like we</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.730" end="01:12:18.380" style="s2">doing that come and you make the card</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:20.930" style="s2">learning from from reinforcement</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.380" end="01:12:22.760" style="s2">learning system so you generate the data</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.930" end="01:12:24.560" style="s2">so you you generate situation where you</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.760" end="01:12:27.140" style="s2">put the car in a situation where it</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.560" end="01:12:28.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be and you learn from that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.140" end="01:12:31.370" style="s2">straight it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a simple</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.760" end="01:12:32.390" style="s2">thing but we have like good approaches</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.370" end="01:12:34.010" style="s2">or calm that we that we are</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.390" end="01:12:35.750" style="s2">investigating and we actually like using</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.010" end="01:12:38.050" style="s2">right now on on models that we are</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.750" end="01:12:38.050" style="s2">deploying</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.410" end="01:12:41.410" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.929" end="01:12:48.420" style="s2">so I know you&#39;ve been asked this</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.769" end="01:12:50.219" style="s2">probably a hundred times before and this</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.420" end="01:12:51.479" style="s2">question is not new at all but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.219" end="01:12:53.489" style="s2">interested on your take on it</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.479" end="01:12:55.289" style="s2">so the safety issue if you have a car</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.489" end="01:12:58.199" style="s2">and there are pedestrians and the car</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.289" end="01:12:59.939" style="s2">has to decide if it&#39;s going to crash to</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.199" end="01:13:02.459" style="s2">save the pedestrians or the people in</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.939" end="01:13:04.079" style="s2">the car or maybe a way to crash to save</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.459" end="01:13:06.239" style="s2">the people in the car and the front</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.079" end="01:13:08.760" style="s2">versus the back how would a car make</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.239" end="01:13:11.670" style="s2">that decision great so you&#39;re right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.760" end="01:13:14.939" style="s2">been asked a lot of times about this and</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.670" end="01:13:17.249" style="s2">the answer is IIIi don&#39;t think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.939" end="01:13:20.519" style="s2">very very relevant problem at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.249" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s not at the point where like</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.519" end="01:13:24.420" style="s2">this kind of decision matters and also I</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:25.889" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s very relevant even if</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.420" end="01:13:27.510" style="s2">we were at that point I think the answer</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.889" end="01:13:31.349" style="s2">is very relevant at the point that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.510" end="01:13:33.630" style="s2">may need like a car that is like driving</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.349" end="01:13:36.510" style="s2">safer than a human like the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.630" end="01:13:38.969" style="s2">decisions are really down the point</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.510" end="01:13:40.679" style="s2">where they don&#39;t matter I don&#39;t see such</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.969" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">like I don&#39;t see it even from an ethical</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.679" end="01:13:44.849" style="s2">point of view I don&#39;t see it being like</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:46.380" style="s2">that like let the engineer on the side</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.849" end="01:13:49.800" style="s2">like as long as the overall output</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.380" end="01:13:51.389" style="s2">system is like safer it does not really</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.800" end="01:13:53.280" style="s2">matter like what what would a human do</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.389" end="01:13:54.749" style="s2">right the only reason why we don&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.280" end="01:13:56.939" style="s2">this question to human is because we</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.749" end="01:13:58.739" style="s2">think that it&#39;s happening fasting after</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.939" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">the human doesn&#39;t have to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.739" end="01:14:01.380" style="s2">but so what would a human do let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:02.939" style="s2">you have enough time to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.380" end="01:14:04.739" style="s2">in some case you might have enough time</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.939" end="01:14:08.099" style="s2">to think about this situation what would</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.739" end="01:14:10.050" style="s2">a human do and I would say another</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.099" end="01:14:11.760" style="s2">possible answer is well how to prevent</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.050" end="01:14:13.260" style="s2">this sort of situation beforehand so you</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.760" end="01:14:14.909" style="s2">want we want to be able to minimize as</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.260" end="01:14:16.249" style="s2">much as possible situation where you</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.909" end="01:14:18.989" style="s2">have no good options</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.249" end="01:14:20.610" style="s2">so that would be step one and then step</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.989" end="01:14:22.439" style="s2">two is like I mean like what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.610" end="01:14:24.389" style="s2">I think it&#39;s not a girl question that</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.439" end="01:14:26.070" style="s2">applies to robust I think it&#39;s a legal</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.389" end="01:14:27.900" style="s2">question that like could could apply to</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.070" end="01:14:31.170" style="s2">you man if you want ask the question I</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.900" end="01:14:32.699" style="s2">think I know during startup we drive a I</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.170" end="01:14:35.159" style="s2">did a presentation and that question</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.699" end="01:14:37.170" style="s2">came up there and for their models they</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.159" end="01:14:38.969" style="s2">trained to stop so like even if it</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.170" end="01:14:42.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be an immediate safety</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.969" end="01:14:45.119" style="s2">thing and this is it was in limited</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.809" end="01:14:47.699" style="s2">deployment but it was to take the car</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.119" end="01:14:51.409" style="s2">safely to a stop before they got to</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.699" end="01:14:51.409" style="s2">where it was collision closed</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.179" end="01:15:14.639" style="s2">yes well our complaints is already it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.800" end="01:15:16.949" style="s2">already happened it&#39;s not it&#39;s not full</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.639" end="01:15:18.389" style="s2">automation but like I would say like</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.949" end="01:15:21.810" style="s2">planes are the closest thing to what we</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.389" end="01:15:24.630" style="s2">intend as level to level to driver like</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.810" end="01:15:25.829" style="s2">Suzanne driving cars in agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.630" end="01:15:28.320" style="s2">already happened why do you have these</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.829" end="01:15:32.070" style="s2">like big tractors doing doing the field</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.320" end="01:15:33.869" style="s2">work without human assistance ships I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.070" end="01:15:36.179" style="s2">not an expert in ships but I would say</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.869" end="01:15:37.770" style="s2">that yeah most of the ship work can be</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.179" end="01:15:38.880" style="s2">done without a human constant like</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.770" end="01:15:41.159" style="s2">interacting with it and there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:47.579" style="s2">probably like good warning systems to</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.159" end="01:15:49.320" style="s2">avoid colliding with icebergs and other</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.579" end="01:15:51.900" style="s2">fields like train I&#39;m trained already</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.320" end="01:15:53.730" style="s2">like people automated like me to meet</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.900" end="01:15:56.760" style="s2">metals there are like me it was like um</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.730" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">it was don&#39;t even and like I Drive like</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.760" end="01:16:04.889" style="s2">a Macanese like a person that stays</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:07.610" style="s2">stays in physically looking into it</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.889" end="01:16:12.869" style="s2">being into the into the metal itself and</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.610" end="01:16:14.670" style="s2">into the path so yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.869" end="01:16:17.340" style="s2">already happened I think it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.670" end="01:16:19.380" style="s2">happen and it&#39;s already happen sooner in</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.340" end="01:16:21.900" style="s2">other fields before it&#39;s gonna happen in</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.380" end="01:16:23.849" style="s2">so dragon capsule so I think also</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.900" end="01:16:25.590" style="s2">probably gonna be like the tail of of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.849" end="01:16:27.599" style="s2">these things which is why when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.590" end="01:16:29.310" style="s2">about like level 5 this idea of having</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.599" end="01:16:31.590" style="s2">like a curve it has complete itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.310" end="01:16:34.260" style="s2">without the assistance of a human as</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.590" end="01:16:36.179" style="s2">well as a human boon it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.260" end="01:16:39.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna happen without us</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.179" end="01:16:41.849" style="s2">noticing it it&#39;s gonna be I think at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.000" end="01:16:44.670" style="s2">tail of many how they are filled that</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.849" end="01:16:46.050" style="s2">are gonna be automated first so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.670" end="01:16:48.840" style="s2">gonna know when we&#39;re gonna be close to</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.050" end="01:16:50.639" style="s2">level 5 we will know it if we now we</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.840" end="01:16:52.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know it means that we&#39;re not close</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.639" end="01:16:55.110" style="s2">I think one good thing that comes out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.889" end="01:16:57.599" style="s2">it though is a lot of the technology</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.110" end="01:16:58.570" style="s2">used to detect things and solve problems</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.599" end="01:17:00.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.570" end="01:17:02.470" style="s2">to end up cars can be used for assisted</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.760" end="01:17:04.330" style="s2">technology on other modes of</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.470" end="01:17:06.670" style="s2">transportation so they&#39;ve already had</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.330" end="01:17:08.200" style="s2">kind of independent aids that can help</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.670" end="01:17:10.450" style="s2">you know people navigate who are</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.200" end="01:17:13.480" style="s2">mobility challenged so I think that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.450" end="01:17:15.070" style="s2">one just ninth nice natural consequence</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.480" end="01:17:17.640" style="s2">of the development that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.070" end="01:17:17.640" style="s2">your space</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.780" end="01:17:30.960" style="s2">so obviously you as a company and all</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.050" end="01:17:33.460" style="s2">companies will have tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.960" end="01:17:35.800" style="s2">tremendous incentive to make it an</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.460" end="01:17:38.290" style="s2">accident free environment because one</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.800" end="01:17:41.490" style="s2">accident is going to drive your share</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.290" end="01:17:45.210" style="s2">price down so that will necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.490" end="01:17:48.340" style="s2">limit what your car will allow the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.210" end="01:17:52.090" style="s2">passenger to want to do so if I want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.340" end="01:17:54.070" style="s2">speed in my own car and I&#39;m driving I</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.090" end="01:17:57.430" style="s2">have the full autonomy to do whatever I</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.070" end="01:18:02.980" style="s2">want and I&#39;m taking my full risk when</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.430" end="01:18:07.540" style="s2">the decision is is delegated to the car</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.980" end="01:18:11.500" style="s2">manufacturer they have the the incentive</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.540" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">to minimize accidents at the expense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.500" end="01:18:18.400" style="s2">individual passenger or owner autonomy</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">can you express your opinion on that</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.400" end="01:18:25.120" style="s2">yeah I mean I think like people</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:27.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t speed and I mean say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.120" end="01:18:28.600" style="s2">see why cars like and we are able to go</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.370" end="01:18:30.550" style="s2">up to 100 miles per hour</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.600" end="01:18:32.260" style="s2">like if the max limit is like 70 like</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.550" end="01:18:33.850" style="s2">let&#39;s say 7 let&#39;s say 80 miles per hour</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.260" end="01:18:35.230" style="s2">I can limit the speed of 80 miles per</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.850" end="01:18:36.790" style="s2">hour like the large majority of</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.230" end="01:18:37.900" style="s2">accidents are caused because people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.790" end="01:18:41.380" style="s2">driving in a way they&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.900" end="01:18:43.090" style="s2">drive so limiting the the way that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.380" end="01:18:44.980" style="s2">car is capable of what the carriage</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.090" end="01:18:48.520" style="s2">capable of doing is not a limit to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.980" end="01:18:49.930" style="s2">freedom of like owner of the car to</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.520" end="01:18:53.110" style="s2">drive the car it&#39;s actually like a smart</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.930" end="01:18:54.280" style="s2">thing to do but I want also like comment</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.110" end="01:18:56.830" style="s2">on the first thing that you said which</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.280" end="01:18:58.330" style="s2">is like one accident the for autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.830" end="01:18:59.740" style="s2">vehicle is gonna be very bad and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.330" end="01:19:02.290" style="s2">gonna there is a need to push for</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.740" end="01:19:05.500" style="s2">accident phrase well I mean perfect is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.290" end="01:19:07.030" style="s2">the worst enemy of good right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.500" end="01:19:08.760" style="s2">focus where we are now and let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.030" end="01:19:10.469" style="s2">make things better let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.760" end="01:19:12.660" style="s2">overemphasize of</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.469" end="01:19:14.310" style="s2">yes there&#39;s gonna be accidents but we</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.660" end="01:19:15.570" style="s2">have a lot of accidents now we need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.310" end="01:19:18.180" style="s2">make something that is better than now</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.570" end="01:19:20.460" style="s2">if we if we if we emphasize too much</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.180" end="01:19:21.840" style="s2">like for example we do with planes when</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.460" end="01:19:24.180" style="s2">there is a like a plane accident we</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.840" end="01:19:26.520" style="s2">emphasize it too much then people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.180" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">gonna have this like over a perception</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.520" end="01:19:33.630" style="s2">for what safety is and yeah we need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.960" end="01:19:35.400" style="s2">avoid we to do our best to avoid to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.630" end="01:19:37.199" style="s2">into these like force perception that</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.400" end="01:19:38.850" style="s2">some driving her are not gonna be safe</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.199" end="01:19:41.400" style="s2">because we are worth a lot about one</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.850" end="01:19:43.380" style="s2">accident we have to wait it with actual</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.400" end="01:19:46.680" style="s2">data actual numbers we have to wait it</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.380" end="01:19:49.860" style="s2">with the 37,000 fatalities that happen</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.680" end="01:19:50.760" style="s2">each year in US and so yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.860" end="01:19:52.680" style="s2">think we need to have a database</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.760" end="01:19:54.300" style="s2">approach when when we talk about safety</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.680" end="01:20:02.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s very important that we push for</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.300" end="01:20:04.860" style="s2">that yes so you&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.610" end="01:20:08.550" style="s2">autonomous vehicle is there any</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.860" end="01:20:09.719" style="s2">development that a vehicle is part of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.550" end="01:20:13.469" style="s2">network and they will exchange</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.719" end="01:20:15.330" style="s2">information like intent what a car like</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.469" end="01:20:17.160" style="s2">intent what a car is going to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.330" end="01:20:19.290" style="s2">going to turn alright and then other</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.160" end="01:20:21.630" style="s2">cars no so you&#39;re talking like vehicle</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.290" end="01:20:23.610" style="s2">to vehicle communication exactly I have</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.630" end="01:20:27.120" style="s2">two traffic lights or whatever yes okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.610" end="01:20:29.160" style="s2">so I I think it&#39;s different things I</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.120" end="01:20:30.750" style="s2">think one of them is good one of them is</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.160" end="01:20:31.980" style="s2">now going to happen so what is now going</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.750" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">to happen I think is very good a</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.980" end="01:20:35.699" style="s2">communication the problem with a connect</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:37.860" style="s2">to communication are public I would say</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.699" end="01:20:40.469" style="s2">to one problem is it&#39;s gonna be very</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.860" end="01:20:42.270" style="s2">hard to make every car manufacturer to</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.469" end="01:20:44.940" style="s2">agree on a protocol of communication I</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.270" end="01:20:46.410" style="s2">just don&#39;t see this happening like so</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.940" end="01:20:48.300" style="s2">which type of the ATAG an exchange</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.410" end="01:20:50.760" style="s2">because like you basically need to may</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.300" end="01:20:54.449" style="s2">have many developers agreeing on a</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.760" end="01:20:56.670" style="s2">common standard and also I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.449" end="01:20:57.960" style="s2">being necessary like you understand what</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.670" end="01:20:59.910" style="s2">the other car is doing by observing</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.960" end="01:21:01.260" style="s2">other car you don&#39;t need to know in</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.910" end="01:21:03.150" style="s2">advance of what the other guy is going</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.260" end="01:21:05.310" style="s2">to do and also like how do you trust</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.150" end="01:21:06.660" style="s2">like you are not the developer like if</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.310" end="01:21:08.430" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about they convey</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.660" end="01:21:09.540" style="s2">communication between your cars probably</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.430" end="01:21:11.130" style="s2">you can do something but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.540" end="01:21:13.530" style="s2">going to have a fee that is large enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.130" end="01:21:16.770" style="s2">to be relevant and to be something you</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.530" end="01:21:19.340" style="s2">can rely on so if you have to rely on</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.770" end="01:21:21.369" style="s2">somebody else development of like</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.340" end="01:21:24.340" style="s2">attributes like in</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.369" end="01:21:26.889" style="s2">path accelerations those things that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.340" end="01:21:27.880" style="s2">not even simple to measure and to</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.889" end="01:21:30.010" style="s2">predict in the future</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.880" end="01:21:31.060" style="s2">well imagine trusting not something to</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.010" end="01:21:33.310" style="s2">battle but trusting somebody that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.060" end="01:21:34.869" style="s2">somebody has developed so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.310" end="01:21:36.820" style="s2">even if it was the case I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.869" end="01:21:39.820" style="s2">this being being useful like I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.820" end="01:21:41.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t see one thing that instead I do</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.820" end="01:21:42.940" style="s2">see happening is vehicle to</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.320" end="01:21:45.190" style="s2">infrastructure communication between v2</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.940" end="01:21:46.780" style="s2">ax so v2 action genera like this idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.190" end="01:21:48.520" style="s2">that like the car needs some information</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.780" end="01:21:50.530" style="s2">from the first structure so for example</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.520" end="01:21:52.690" style="s2">like traffic light you want to optimize</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.530" end="01:21:54.520" style="s2">for traffic you want to optimize for</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.690" end="01:21:58.630" style="s2">like going from A to B you want to know</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.520" end="01:22:00.340" style="s2">the state of for example of traffic</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.630" end="01:22:02.380" style="s2">lights and so yeah you can know that but</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.340" end="01:22:04.810" style="s2">that&#39;s different because there is like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.380" end="01:22:07.030" style="s2">manufacturer or that makes the standard</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.810" end="01:22:08.679" style="s2">and then it&#39;s up to the car developers</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.030" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">again to a standard that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.679" end="01:22:12.969" style="s2">have to admit to the Indonesia start to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:15.969" style="s2">comply with so that&#39;s that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.969" end="01:22:17.080" style="s2">bit easier to push under standard and</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.969" end="01:22:19.690" style="s2">also I see it being useful</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.080" end="01:22:24.219" style="s2">I see like yeah I mean knowing in</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.690" end="01:22:25.449" style="s2">advance informations that&#39;s useful and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.219" end="01:22:26.980" style="s2">mean a certain size it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.449" end="01:22:29.290" style="s2">happening like v2 acts like if you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.980" end="01:22:31.420" style="s2">to know like I mean like your GPS</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.290" end="01:22:31.960" style="s2">position like in some senses be two acts</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.420" end="01:22:33.429" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.960" end="01:22:36.310" style="s2">you&#39;re you are you are communicating</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.429" end="01:22:42.090" style="s2">with with satellite so it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.310" end="01:22:48.250" style="s2">evolution of what&#39;s already here yes</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.090" end="01:22:50.650" style="s2">so standards for inter communication</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.250" end="01:22:52.270" style="s2">already exist in the development world</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.650" end="01:22:54.849" style="s2">why do you think it would be different</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.270" end="01:22:57.310" style="s2">for autonomous vehicles like well why do</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.849" end="01:22:58.690" style="s2">you think developers were in create come</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.310" end="01:23:02.469" style="s2">together and create a set of standards</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.690" end="01:23:05.460" style="s2">that they can develop on well because I</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.469" end="01:23:08.920" style="s2">mean fundamentally there is really no so</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.460" end="01:23:12.550" style="s2">I mean the death like a reason I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.920" end="01:23:14.199" style="s2">saying yes you can be standard part of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.550" end="01:23:16.090" style="s2">communication but if there is no I</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.199" end="01:23:18.310" style="s2">really need for that like a real</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.090" end="01:23:19.869" style="s2">advantage there&#39;s another reason for</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.310" end="01:23:21.670" style="s2">that not to happen so it&#39;s two of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.869" end="01:23:24.489" style="s2">course not only one so again on</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.670" end="01:23:26.080" style="s2">something is not the course not being</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.489" end="01:23:27.310" style="s2">useful he&#39;s another obstacles if you put</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.080" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">these two things together that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.310" end="01:23:30.489" style="s2">see is not going to happen for for</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.440" end="01:23:32.269" style="s2">because I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.489" end="01:23:34.400" style="s2">to agree on</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.269" end="01:23:35.929" style="s2">as I&#39;m saying that if there is not to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.400" end="01:23:38.050" style="s2">like a big push for it it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.929" end="01:23:38.050" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.739" end="01:23:43.369" style="s2">yeah I think if you like you people I</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.050" end="01:23:44.659" style="s2">mean the companies should invest not</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.369" end="01:23:46.400" style="s2">like understanding environment</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.659" end="01:23:49.489" style="s2">understanding what other cars are doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.400" end="01:23:50.900" style="s2">but it what are their like players on</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.489" end="01:23:52.849" style="s2">the environment are doing based on what</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.900" end="01:23:55.280" style="s2">you observe from them rather than having</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.849" end="01:23:57.739" style="s2">them telling you what&#39;s like it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.280" end="01:23:59.900" style="s2">happen my work okay for cars but what</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.739" end="01:24:02.510" style="s2">about cyclists what about pedestrians</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.900" end="01:24:05.420" style="s2">and those are like equivalently are the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.510" end="01:24:06.800" style="s2">players on this on on the film like on</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.420" end="01:24:10.579" style="s2">the environment that you have to deal</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.800" end="01:24:12.349" style="s2">with and so yeah even if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.579" end="01:24:15.769" style="s2">could help it&#39;s not something you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.349" end="01:24:18.769" style="s2">rely entirely because not this</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.769" end="01:24:26.780" style="s2">information cannot even come from all</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.769" end="01:24:29.150" style="s2">the players in the environment security</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.780" end="01:24:33.409" style="s2">measures you guys have been taking not</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.150" end="01:24:35.420" style="s2">to hack your software yeah so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.409" end="01:24:38.539" style="s2">like okay so you know when you develop</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.420" end="01:24:39.829" style="s2">systems for for like level two is</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.539" end="01:24:41.659" style="s2">different than when you al when you</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.829" end="01:24:43.400" style="s2">develop like safety systems from level</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.659" end="01:24:46.460" style="s2">two in abhava when we develop system for</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.400" end="01:24:49.280" style="s2">like level two the driver is always</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.460" end="01:24:51.499" style="s2">responsible in the end and so you need</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.280" end="01:24:54.650" style="s2">to make sure that every action that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.499" end="01:24:58.699" style="s2">car takes in autonomy is never gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.650" end="01:25:00.230" style="s2">too abrupt to make the driver are not</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.699" end="01:25:01.639" style="s2">capable of really taking control of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.230" end="01:25:04.789" style="s2">vehicle if they if the car is something</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.639" end="01:25:08.389" style="s2">wrong so by doing this you&#39;re limiting</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.789" end="01:25:09.980" style="s2">for example the amount of like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.389" end="01:25:14.599" style="s2">operational domain of your actuators</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.980" end="01:25:15.800" style="s2">some example like the braking system you</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.599" end="01:25:18.590" style="s2">need to make sure that your braking</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.800" end="01:25:20.630" style="s2">system is never gonna command too much</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.590" end="01:25:22.639" style="s2">braking deceleration because if you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.630" end="01:25:24.019" style="s2">mistakenly braking when you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.639" end="01:25:25.820" style="s2">think you are driving a highway at high</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.019" end="01:25:27.530" style="s2">speed then you can cause an accident so</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.820" end="01:25:29.539" style="s2">the way that you make the system saves</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.530" end="01:25:31.550" style="s2">for level two is you limit your</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.539" end="01:25:34.519" style="s2">operational domain what that translates</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.550" end="01:25:36.739" style="s2">into is you are making a system that by</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.519" end="01:25:38.559" style="s2">design is now going to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.739" end="01:25:42.369" style="s2">100 percent of the mice that you drive</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.559" end="01:25:45.699" style="s2">to give you like some numbers like</p>

<p begin="01:25:45.699" end="01:25:52.059" style="s2">from Statistics some people from the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.369" end="01:25:53.499" style="s2">University of MIT collected a large data</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.059" end="01:25:56.409" style="s2">form from a fleet that they monitored</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.499" end="01:25:58.349" style="s2">and thirdly I think it&#39;s 32 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.409" end="01:26:01.749" style="s2">the miles driven are driven with</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.349" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">autopilot on for us for people to drive</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.749" end="01:26:09.579" style="s2">with open pilot it&#39;s 52 percent we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:12.010" style="s2">working towards the 80 percent maybe 85</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.579" end="01:26:13.599" style="s2">we know we are not like by design of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.010" end="01:26:15.130" style="s2">level system is now gonna get to other</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.599" end="01:26:17.380" style="s2">percent there are certain environment</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.130" end="01:26:19.179" style="s2">where if you have the cooperating in</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.380" end="01:26:20.590" style="s2">autonomy there it&#39;s just not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.179" end="01:26:22.300" style="s2">safe because in order to be able to</p>

<p begin="01:26:22.300" end="01:26:27.639" style="s2">taking actions that you might not be</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.849" end="01:26:29.769" style="s2">able to retake control quick enough for</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.639" end="01:26:31.329" style="s2">example taking like 90 degree turns in</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.769" end="01:26:33.280" style="s2">an environment where there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.329" end="01:26:37.389" style="s2">pedestrian around like this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.280" end="01:26:48.969" style="s2">place where lever to system if you want</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.389" end="01:26:51.999" style="s2">to work environment you need level any</p>

<p begin="01:26:58.360" end="01:27:02.349" style="s2">our key time explore our code see what</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.729" end="01:27:04.959" style="s2">we do and see what is like our approach</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.349" end="01:27:08.880" style="s2">of trying to make the existing fleet of</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.959" end="01:27:08.880" style="s2">cars smarter than what they are now</p>
