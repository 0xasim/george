<p begin="00:34:29.099" end="00:34:36.580" style="s2">complete graph traversal I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.070" end="00:34:39.669" style="s2">like Dijkstra from all the paths naively</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.580" end="00:34:41.800" style="s2">off the top of my head I think okay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.669" end="00:34:43.629" style="s2">the floyd-warshall is is Dijkstra it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.800" end="00:34:47.349" style="s2">like it&#39;s like pre solving Dijkstra</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.629" end="00:34:49.480" style="s2">right so Dijkstra is given two nodes in</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.349" end="00:34:51.350" style="s2">a graph what&#39;s the shortest path between</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.350" end="00:34:56.450" style="s2">so if your graph has three vertices</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.860" end="00:35:03.290" style="s2">nice V Square D or just like n cubed if</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.730" end="00:35:04.580" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of like like just o event</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.580" end="00:35:09.080" style="s2">I think it&#39;s B squared you know social</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.080" end="00:35:14.630" style="s2">events I can think about this a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.460" end="00:35:17.570" style="s2">bit more right so you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.630" end="00:35:22.460" style="s2">basically the shortest path between any</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.570" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">two vertices in a graph and the graph is</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.730" end="00:35:35.210" style="s2">written it before this is the downside</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:46.040" style="s2">if you have an excuse it would like flip</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.570" end="00:35:47.240" style="s2">through Bing algorithms that you bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.040" end="00:35:50.390" style="s2">like you trying concrete and stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.240" end="00:35:51.770" style="s2">you can print stuff out too so you print</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.390" end="00:35:53.810" style="s2">out I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure you&#39;d literally</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.770" end="00:35:55.700" style="s2">have a floyd-warshall implementation</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.810" end="00:35:57.589" style="s2">they are ready to go you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:35:59.980" style="s2">shove it in but yeah okay so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.589" end="00:35:59.980" style="s2">what you do</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.740" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">so Oh God even if you ask me about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.050" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">complexity of Dijkstra I have to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:07.400" style="s2">it through these are not things that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:08.540" style="s2">know off the top of my head but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.400" end="00:36:09.560" style="s2">truth is you don&#39;t want to know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.540" end="00:36:10.820" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.560" end="00:36:15.050" style="s2">you want to be able to think things</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.820" end="00:36:17.960" style="s2">through but you have to have some basic</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.050" end="00:36:19.640" style="s2">so let&#39;s go over a little bit of basics</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.960" end="00:36:23.180" style="s2">do you guys know like what a graph is</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.640" end="00:36:26.210" style="s2">yeah Tomiko he said Oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.180" end="00:36:27.800" style="s2">be cute Oh a beat cubed okay it&#39;s b</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.210" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">cubed all right all right all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.800" end="00:36:32.140" style="s2">had I was close to the order of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:36.260" style="s2">magnitude but for some reason it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.140" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">squared and the number of edges</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.260" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">apparently until</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.340" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">yeah I mean okay you could see kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.290" end="00:36:46.820" style="s2">intuitively why that&#39;s true right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:52.310" style="s2">because I can&#39;t imagine like a complete</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.820" end="00:36:54.590" style="s2">graph taking I can take it true I could</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.310" end="00:36:55.820" style="s2">I can free derived yeah any more any</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.590" end="00:37:02.270" style="s2">more concise questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.820" end="00:37:04.060" style="s2">Marcia Mason no we&#39;re not let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.270" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">derive it let&#39;s figure out why it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.060" end="00:37:09.320" style="s2">so you you remember you have a graph so</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:13.130" style="s2">a graph is what I say a graph you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.320" end="00:37:15.800" style="s2">don&#39;t mean like a times I know so a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.130" end="00:37:17.330" style="s2">graph has like vertices and edges of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.800" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">great you have like like to think of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.330" end="00:37:22.190" style="s2">like a point and then like edges when a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:24.140" style="s2">graph is like a structures when they</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:28.610" style="s2">talk about graph theory it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.140" end="00:37:30.650" style="s2">you know what yeah yeah because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.610" end="00:37:32.270" style="s2">could graph y equals MX plus D but no I</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.650" end="00:37:35.560" style="s2">mean something other than that right all</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.270" end="00:37:35.560" style="s2">right so let&#39;s redirect like Martian</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.930" end="00:37:39.859" style="s2">so first off let&#39;s figure out the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.819" end="00:37:42.259" style="s2">complexity of times two so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.859" end="00:37:43.490" style="s2">grand frightened think about traversing</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.259" end="00:37:45.980" style="s2">your graph as you&#39;re trying to get from</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.490" end="00:37:48.349" style="s2">this think about okay here&#39;s a sample so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.980" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very relevant to spur on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.349" end="00:37:52.069" style="s2">road trip think about each city like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:54.940" style="s2">vertex right</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.069" end="00:37:59.269" style="s2">and each road connecting them as an edge</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.940" end="00:38:01.279" style="s2">and then each edge has has like a cost</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.269" end="00:38:03.470" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a cost to traversing</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.279" end="00:38:05.210" style="s2">that right so you might think of costs</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.470" end="00:38:07.309" style="s2">as like timings right so we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.210" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">the highway from Kansas City which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.309" end="00:38:11.749" style="s2">one vertex to Omaha which is another</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.609" style="s2">vertex and this maybe has a cost of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.749" end="00:38:14.869" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s let&#39;s say 180</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.609" end="00:38:17.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s a hundred eighty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.869" end="00:38:19.880" style="s2">right we could also stop by you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.480" end="00:38:20.630" style="s2">whatever like like rubber or faucet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.880" end="00:38:22.549" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.630" end="00:38:26.509" style="s2">faucets maybe this edge over here right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.549" end="00:38:28.940" style="s2">and maybe it takes you know 300 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.509" end="00:38:31.249" style="s2">to get from faucet to Omaha and then 100</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.940" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">minutes to from Kansas City over you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.249" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">could take this path in the graph for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:40.170" style="s2">total of 400 or you can take this path</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:41.580" style="s2">for 180 right so if you&#39;re routing</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.170" end="00:38:43.080" style="s2">Dijkstra it&#39;s the thing that I just</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.580" end="00:38:46.260" style="s2">should know off the top of my head but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.080" end="00:38:47.820" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s been a while you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.260" end="00:38:51.390" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s the shortest path from</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.820" end="00:38:52.849" style="s2">point A to point B so the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.390" end="00:38:55.450" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.849" end="00:38:55.450" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.110" end="00:39:03.890" style="s2">you think of a star a star works if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.030" end="00:39:07.130" style="s2">have a silver stick for any stars just</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.890" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">Dykstra Dykstra is a star without a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.130" end="00:39:09.980" style="s2">currency from trying to heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:11.230" style="s2">function you can think I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.980" end="00:39:13.930" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.230" end="00:39:16.329" style="s2">an estimate for how close you want write</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.930" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">an estimate so say you got to say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.329" end="00:39:19.960" style="s2">got to false it right and you say there</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:22.450" style="s2">was like a lot of nodes between Fawcett</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.960" end="00:39:24.430" style="s2">and Omaha you wouldn&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.450" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">your distance from Fawcett to Omaha off</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.430" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">the top of your head without actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">traversing a right so the algorithm is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">you started a vertex you expand out all</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:36.730" style="s2">of the intimus right then you go to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.470" style="s2">another vertex and you expand out all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.730" end="00:39:42.700" style="s2">the edges as well you go to another</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.470" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">vertex yeah so you&#39;re going to each</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.700" end="00:39:49.000" style="s2">vertex once and Dijkstra so you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:55.930" style="s2">about the complexity as V and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.000" end="00:39:58.810" style="s2">you&#39;re traversing each edge at most once</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.930" end="00:40:01.089" style="s2">right because the trick is what you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.810" end="00:40:03.250" style="s2">from here to here you don&#39;t have to save</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.089" end="00:40:06.130" style="s2">all the slower intermediate this one day</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.250" end="00:40:10.359" style="s2">passes you only have to save the fastest</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.130" end="00:40:13.180" style="s2">driver so space complexity is one number</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.359" end="00:40:15.160" style="s2">per vertex and the time complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">the number of vertices times a number of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.160" end="00:40:18.849" style="s2">edges all right you can think about why</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.220" style="s2">because the most you&#39;ll ever have to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.849" end="00:40:23.410" style="s2">is traverse each edge ones and visit</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.220" end="00:40:27.540" style="s2">each node in the graph once in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.410" end="00:40:27.540" style="s2">get to and right</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:36.940" style="s2">is VD right so if Floyd Marshall is vq</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.020" end="00:40:38.230" style="s2">that means you&#39;re doing something in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.940" end="00:40:40.950" style="s2">time complexity of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.230" end="00:40:43.990" style="s2">vertices ma cute</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.950" end="00:40:45.220" style="s2">okay you know what I mean yeah okay all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.990" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">right you can see why this is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.220" end="00:40:50.770" style="s2">true because originally I said it was V</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:54.750" style="s2">squared eat but you&#39;re not gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:54.750" style="s2">traverse edges</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.470" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">unless they are shorter because your</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.619" end="00:41:04.050" style="s2">computing every pass right you can think</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:07.020" style="s2">about imagine pre-computing Dijkstra for</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.050" end="00:41:08.819" style="s2">the whole graph right between every</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.020" end="00:41:10.829" style="s2">vertex and every other vertex</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.819" end="00:41:12.569" style="s2">so that&#39;s naively V Square D right</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.829" end="00:41:15.450" style="s2">because if Dijkstra&#39;s Vee will that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.569" end="00:41:18.210" style="s2">one vertex to one other but then one</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.450" end="00:41:20.670" style="s2">vertex to vertex did every vertex is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.210" end="00:41:22.380" style="s2">also V D it doesn&#39;t matter that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.670" end="00:41:24.990" style="s2">one target because it might be the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.380" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">one to explore to be honest there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.990" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">even a space complexity difference you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:30.630" style="s2">have to say if you have to say although</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">just following us there&#39;s my there&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.630" end="00:41:33.780" style="s2">there&#39;s my there&#39;s my computer science</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:36.060" style="s2">lecture for the day right you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.780" end="00:41:37.890" style="s2">end up now you do have to safe weather</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.060" end="00:41:39.569" style="s2">so if you&#39;re doing Dijkstra you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.890" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">end up saving so if you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.569" end="00:41:43.770" style="s2">from point A to point B right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:45.510" style="s2">going to know that path well but at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.770" end="00:41:47.819" style="s2">the intermediates you&#39;re gonna save the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.510" end="00:41:50.579" style="s2">shortest distance from that intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.819" end="00:41:52.890" style="s2">to point A yeah maybe cuz eventually</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.579" end="00:41:55.589" style="s2">eventually one of your intermediates</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.890" end="00:41:58.050" style="s2">will be one hop away from point B and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.589" end="00:42:00.180" style="s2">then you can get a total of total path</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.050" end="00:42:02.910" style="s2">we get them said thank you sis</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.180" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">Neela okay it&#39;s a log V right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.910" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2">thinking about that now watch I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">thinking it had to be less than me right</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.650" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">but but but I don&#39;t see naively why</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.050" end="00:42:19.070" style="s2">so so so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.740" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s another version of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.440" end="00:42:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s me squared to give to I think I</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">took a graph theory course for a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.360" end="00:42:35.170" style="s2">bit yeah you guys all get the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:35.170" style="s2">of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.240" end="00:43:00.260" style="s2">by Mary</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.040" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">okay so you can pick it up maybe that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.540" end="00:43:11.100" style="s2">the now versus out okay you can think</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.660" style="s2">about putting things in a in a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.100" end="00:43:15.510" style="s2">all god I have to write a proof for why</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.660" end="00:43:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not ve but you can think about but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.510" end="00:43:20.930" style="s2">a vague heuristic function to getcha to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.750" end="00:43:20.930" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">and you want to start by your at point a</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.550" end="00:43:29.660" style="s2">right you expand out this edge has a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:32.390" style="s2">weight of 20 this edge has a weight of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.660" end="00:43:33.890" style="s2">10 and such as a way to 5 write it so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.390" end="00:43:35.570" style="s2">the first one you&#39;re gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.890" end="00:43:36.830" style="s2">expand out is the one with a way of 5</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.570" end="00:43:39.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.830" end="00:43:41.780" style="s2">shortest path and then from the way to 5</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.800" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">right if this one has if it only has</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.780" end="00:43:45.410" style="s2">like one edge away from it the weight of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:47.450" style="s2">30 then you&#39;re gonna want to revisit the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.410" end="00:43:50.270" style="s2">one with a weight of 10 right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.450" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">gonna want to keep them sorted you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.270" end="00:43:54.190" style="s2">gonna want to keep them sorted like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:54.190" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:04.300" style="s2">so if that&#39;s the data structure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.300" end="00:44:09.570" style="s2">using you&#39;ll have to prove to me that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.300" end="00:44:09.570" style="s2">like some vertices will never be</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.360" end="00:44:20.120" style="s2">so let&#39;s think of some examples</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.410" end="00:44:20.120" style="s2">this is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.820" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">okay okay so you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.960" end="00:44:27.110" style="s2">Dijkstra from from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:29.120" style="s2">and you have like a really really long</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.110" end="00:44:30.860" style="s2">graph right like say like it&#39;s ten notes</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.120" end="00:44:32.510" style="s2">all right say there&#39;s just literally one</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.860" end="00:44:34.610" style="s2">straight line and you&#39;re just proceeding</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.510" end="00:44:37.550" style="s2">along that you&#39;re obviously gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.610" end="00:44:39.650" style="s2">to visit every vertex but that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.550" end="00:44:42.230" style="s2">complexity is already covered in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.650" end="00:44:45.530" style="s2">edges so that would actually be just go</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.230" end="00:44:47.330" style="s2">of e right because if there&#39;s one vertex</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.530" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">between each right so now let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.330" end="00:44:51.170" style="s2">about the opposite example which is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:53.750" style="s2">completely a complete graph is a graph</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.170" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">where every vertex is connected to every</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.750" end="00:44:59.870" style="s2">other vertex every edge is possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:02.110" style="s2">graph but how many edges are possible on</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.870" end="00:45:02.110" style="s2">the graph</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.180" end="00:45:07.390" style="s2">every vertex is gonna every vertex is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.609" end="00:45:07.390" style="s2">connected to every other vertex</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.390" end="00:45:15.310" style="s2">well what about a complete graph was</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.010" end="00:45:17.859" style="s2">business was one one with one how many</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.310" end="00:45:20.799" style="s2">edges are possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.859" end="00:45:23.619" style="s2">what I would know no one wears the oil I</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.799" end="00:45:26.289" style="s2">have one no right in and assume that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.619" end="00:45:28.209" style="s2">it&#39;s a normal graph so one node one node</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.289" end="00:45:30.519" style="s2">and just one note how many edges can</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.209" end="00:45:33.279" style="s2">know it there are no edges because you</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.519" end="00:45:34.630" style="s2">can&#39;t do that particularly well so now</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.279" end="00:45:41.410" style="s2">you have two notes how many I just can</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.630" end="00:45:43.559" style="s2">have they have dreams 3 3 now you have 4</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.410" end="00:45:43.559" style="s2">nodes</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.470" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">harder</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.320" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s like a sentence it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.390" end="00:45:59.910" style="s2">just and spare - sit down squared - 1 no</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:46:02.490" style="s2">words so let&#39;s let&#39;s look at the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.910" end="00:46:08.589" style="s2">one how many edges does it</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.490" end="00:46:18.069" style="s2">yes first one is three so good 2 1 3 2 1</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.589" end="00:46:27.250" style="s2">right yeah so it&#39;s like you have to read</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.069" end="00:46:34.059" style="s2">minus 1 that word for 5 well no so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.250" end="00:46:36.579" style="s2">4 2 n minus 3 plus 2 plus 1 so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.059" end="00:46:37.000" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s the N minus 1 but expand it</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.579" end="00:46:41.609" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.000" end="00:46:41.609" style="s2">so like n minus 1 times n minus 2 over 2</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.910" end="00:46:48.579" style="s2">is just n minus 1 times a minus 2</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.069" end="00:46:55.419" style="s2">is it fact or okay what&#39;s effective work</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.829" end="00:46:55.419" style="s2">respect Oriole is that you oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.650" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">so when there&#39;s five there&#39;s like four</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.180" end="00:47:05.109" style="s2">plus three plus two</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:05.109" style="s2">5cf where + 3 + 2 + 1 so 5 is</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.060" end="00:47:17.310" style="s2">really what you do is you type zero one</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.520" end="00:47:19.620" style="s2">three six ten into the online</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.310" end="00:47:21.390" style="s2">encyclopedia of integer sequences and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.620" end="00:47:28.290" style="s2">tells you exactly what that is right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.390" end="00:47:34.650" style="s2">times and times n plus one over two yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.290" end="00:47:36.750" style="s2">that sounds my evening right well so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.650" end="00:47:39.350" style="s2">let&#39;s see so so let&#39;s say four five six</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.750" end="00:47:39.350" style="s2">and five was</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.560" end="00:47:48.380" style="s2">oh it is 10% so 5 times 5 minus 1 there</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:51.110" style="s2">you go</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.380" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">magic the magic of Google see this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.110" end="00:47:54.680" style="s2">why nobody ever had to think anymore</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:57.260" style="s2">just google it unless you actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.680" end="00:47:59.870" style="s2">derive that in your house which was good</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.260" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">for you and if you ended if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.870" end="00:48:03.860" style="s2">derived it at your house without paper</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:05.600" style="s2">that done you beat us look like he</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.860" end="00:48:10.190" style="s2">copied pasted it from it was in like</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.600" end="00:48:13.940" style="s2">some logic no no derived it in his head</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.190" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">and then wrote it up in logic will give</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.940" end="00:48:36.620" style="s2">the scope use the benefit of a doubt how</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:38.180" style="s2">long does a real computer science</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.620" end="00:48:41.150" style="s2">lecture oh this is how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.180" end="00:48:42.560" style="s2">you know someone say I surely understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.150" end="00:48:47.840" style="s2">self-driving a reinforcement learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.560" end="00:48:51.230" style="s2">problem supervised door ok topic all</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.840" end="00:48:53.180" style="s2">been to machine learning yeah so ok you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.230" end="00:48:54.020" style="s2">think about it very naively and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.180" end="00:48:56.630" style="s2">obvious it&#39;s a supervised learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.020" end="00:48:59.030" style="s2">problem right so given a picture what</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.630" end="00:49:01.220" style="s2">did the human do in this picture</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.030" end="00:49:02.750" style="s2">so that&#39;s supervised learning because</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.220" end="00:49:04.520" style="s2">you have your X&#39;s which are the pictures</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.750" end="00:49:06.470" style="s2">and your Y&#39;s which are what the human to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.520" end="00:49:07.890" style="s2">hit and you want to learn a function f</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.470" end="00:49:11.460" style="s2">of x equals y</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.890" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">to drive a car if it was that simple our</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.460" end="00:49:19.230" style="s2">car would work way way way better than</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:21.269" style="s2">it does but it&#39;s not that because in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.230" end="00:49:23.039" style="s2">supervised learning like the typical</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.269" end="00:49:24.660" style="s2">scenario the one the academics always</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.039" end="00:49:27.750" style="s2">write out you make this assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.660" end="00:49:30.390" style="s2">your data is iid independent and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.750" end="00:49:33.000" style="s2">identically distributed what this means</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.390" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">is that every data point is independent</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.000" end="00:49:37.859" style="s2">of every other data point you can think</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">of like when this will be true like if I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.859" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">am like sampling without sampling with</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:45.140" style="s2">replacement right like if I have a bingo</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">table right and I pull out one number</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.140" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">and then I put that number back in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.450" end="00:49:51.329" style="s2">table and spin it again and pick out</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:52.650" style="s2">another number right those two events</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.329" end="00:49:54.599" style="s2">are completely independent events are</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.650" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">two coin flips or independent events</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.599" end="00:49:59.910" style="s2">right but if I&#39;m sampling like without</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:02.309" style="s2">replacement if I take that ball out well</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.910" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">then the next event depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.309" end="00:50:05.369" style="s2">happened in the first event we think</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:08.069" style="s2">about drawing cards from a deck of cards</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.369" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">right if I&#39;m holding two aces in my hand</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.069" end="00:50:11.420" style="s2">that affects the probability that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">next card that I&#39;m going to draw is nice</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.420" end="00:50:15.380" style="s2">unless you&#39;re a cheater and you filled</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.710" end="00:50:18.529" style="s2">your deck aces</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.380" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">I&#39;m so that&#39;s what independent means and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.529" end="00:50:24.680" style="s2">identically distributed means that any</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:27.710" style="s2">sample of the data looks like any other</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.680" end="00:50:29.980" style="s2">sample of the data under any statistical</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.710" end="00:50:33.039" style="s2">test as this goes out to infinity right</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.980" end="00:50:35.900" style="s2">so this is again true about like</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.039" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">questions right but on where might this</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.900" end="00:50:40.789" style="s2">not be true if you think about like</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:41.630" style="s2">predicting the next letter in Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.789" end="00:50:43.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.630" end="00:50:46.609" style="s2">your data is not an industry because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.640" end="00:50:49.519" style="s2">the article is about bananas I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.609" end="00:50:51.529" style="s2">word fruit is likely is more likely show</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.519" end="00:50:56.089" style="s2">up right so that&#39;s actually dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.529" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">your context right supervised learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.089" end="00:51:00.019" style="s2">makes these two assumptions independent</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:01.609" style="s2">identically distributed so now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.019" end="00:51:04.670" style="s2">talk about whether these examples</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.609" end="00:51:08.680" style="s2">actually apply to self-driving cars is</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.670" end="00:51:08.680" style="s2">one frame independent of an expert</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.750" end="00:51:14.660" style="s2">if there&#39;s a car in front of me in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.970" end="00:51:15.860" style="s2">frame does that affect the probability</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.660" end="00:51:18.980" style="s2">of there being a car in front of me in</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.860" end="00:51:20.690" style="s2">the hax frame yeah so you violate your</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.980" end="00:51:22.340" style="s2">independence assumption there</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.690" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">how about identically distributed right</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.340" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.349" end="00:51:32.849" style="s2">yeah I mean you have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.019" end="00:51:36.839" style="s2">identically distributed under like what</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.849" end="00:51:39.569" style="s2">model yeah but um so so the real way</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.839" end="00:51:40.979" style="s2">that this stuff is violated is it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.569" end="00:51:42.359" style="s2">you can say okay well I&#39;ll shuffle up</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.979" end="00:51:44.279" style="s2">all the data and they&#39;ll be enough of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.359" end="00:51:46.440" style="s2">and then it&#39;s int and then actually is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.279" end="00:51:49.559" style="s2">iid but the problem is that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.440" end="00:51:51.960" style="s2">happens from the rope on the road you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.559" end="00:51:55.529" style="s2">executing your model like sequentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.960" end="00:51:58.799" style="s2">right and you have your output of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.529" end="00:52:02.910" style="s2">model actually affects what the next</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.799" end="00:52:06.119" style="s2">state looks right if the thing you told</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.910" end="00:52:10.549" style="s2">the car to turn left in the next frame</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.119" end="00:52:10.549" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to be further to the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.420" end="00:52:17.369" style="s2">which is the whole reason that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.499" end="00:52:19.289" style="s2">self-driving cars weren&#39;t honest</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.369" end="00:52:21.809" style="s2">so in the literature this is referred to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.289" end="00:52:23.950" style="s2">as behavioural cloning or cascading</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.809" end="00:52:27.310" style="s2">errors</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.950" end="00:52:32.530" style="s2">and some things a reinforcement learning</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.310" end="00:52:35.650" style="s2">fixes this reinforcement learning fixes</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.530" end="00:52:38.170" style="s2">this B costs so one little bit would fix</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.650" end="00:52:39.790" style="s2">this if we could train it as a minor in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.170" end="00:52:43.810" style="s2">a simulator if you&#39;re actually letting</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.790" end="00:52:48.070" style="s2">the model act then you don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.810" end="00:52:50.380" style="s2">problem but when we&#39;re testing it on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.070" end="00:52:51.820" style="s2">data that you guys sent to us we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.380" end="00:52:53.470" style="s2">let them on lacked because what actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.820" end="00:52:57.210" style="s2">happened is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.470" end="00:52:57.210" style="s2">kind of like the lost theory of contract</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.830" end="00:53:02.170" style="s2">she had Jessica submit dinner</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.130" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">oh can we test the simulator that</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.170" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">perfectly mimics the real world</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:09.990" style="s2">not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.779" end="00:53:14.409" style="s2">a little business but again you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2">testing some we&#39;re not training in</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.409" end="00:53:19.659" style="s2">salmon you could train a simulator to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:21.369" style="s2">build a simulator is kind of like part</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.659" end="00:53:24.959" style="s2">and coding the self-driving car it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.369" end="00:53:24.959" style="s2">graphics instead of vision but still</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.219" end="00:54:00.579" style="s2">yeah therefore the half a semester I</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.109" end="00:54:04.499" style="s2">took this course until it&#39;s gone for my</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.579" end="00:54:04.499" style="s2">market to say hey Kerry</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.430" end="00:54:10.479" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t like it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.160" end="00:54:10.479" style="s2">like it is gonna be real people</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.660" end="00:54:13.779" style="s2">so wiki at that radio who asked you the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.549" end="00:54:15.250" style="s2">question before what does George&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.779" end="00:54:19.809" style="s2">favorite language to program</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.250" end="00:54:22.119" style="s2">- I thought your big rust man Oh God</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.809" end="00:54:23.950" style="s2">just like the shill for nice to show for</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.119" end="00:54:33.789" style="s2">us and then let other people try to code</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.950" end="00:54:35.470" style="s2">in it you know what they say Minh if</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.789" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">you&#39;re good it doesn&#39;t matter how shitty</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.470" end="00:54:40.019" style="s2">your tools are but if you have good</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:40.019" style="s2">tools or even better</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.270" end="00:54:45.830" style="s2">happy add two cups of coffee this</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.640" end="00:54:52.790" style="s2">morning three yeah I drink your coffee</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.830" end="00:54:54.200" style="s2">to help solve the simulator problem okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.790" end="00:54:58.550" style="s2">so what you&#39;re you can read our paper</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.200" end="00:55:01.700" style="s2">I&#39;m learning a driving simulator games</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.550" end="00:55:13.310" style="s2">are kind of the answer just really hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.700" end="00:55:16.570" style="s2">to get to work well you could be right</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.310" end="00:55:19.130" style="s2">next to that tree that&#39;s like your best</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.570" end="00:55:20.870" style="s2">option Amazonia</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.130" end="00:55:22.580" style="s2">oh really in the middle of no we in the</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.580" end="00:55:27.490" style="s2">nowhere here in Nebraska things that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.430" end="00:55:30.660" style="s2">would have seen a sign</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.700" end="00:55:37.940" style="s2">yeah go grab it you out there</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.930" end="00:55:40.190" style="s2">so tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.940" end="00:55:41.299" style="s2">yeah so my talk today is gonna be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.190" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">of complaining about the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.299" end="00:55:46.099" style="s2">realness in the world but I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.420" style="s2">refrain from talking at colleges about</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.099" end="00:55:50.630" style="s2">how college is the greatest game in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.420" end="00:55:53.150" style="s2">day I&#39;ll try I&#39;ll try to refrain but</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.630" end="00:55:55.039" style="s2">guys it really is the Kris Kim mystery</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.150" end="00:55:57.710" style="s2">would you look when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.039" end="00:56:03.910" style="s2">wealth that has been extracted from our</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.710" end="00:56:03.910" style="s2">nation&#39;s youth we&#39;re still in Missouri</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.020" end="00:56:17.130" style="s2">yeah when I was like pretty far down and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:17.130" style="s2">Nebraska I gotta go</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.500" end="00:59:33.440" style="s2">the Nebraska motto is see the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.030" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">I have an interview if you guys want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.030" end="00:59:42.500" style="s2">look it up ND t TV where i shelf for</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.500" end="00:59:48.010" style="s2">blonde I just want a CT app they pulled</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.530" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">my friend to the side and they&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.010" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">swear I get high a lot but I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.770" end="01:00:02.930" style="s2">right the difference attack and defense</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.130" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">insecure right when you attack you</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.930" end="01:00:06.650" style="s2">always win because if you don&#39;t exploit</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:07.579" style="s2">anything nobody knows about you if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.650" end="01:00:10.540" style="s2">do you&#39;re a winner</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.579" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">right will you defend you always loose</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.540" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">because say you fix nine out of the ten</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:17.570" style="s2">exploits you still get grilled for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:20.270" style="s2">one unit so complete</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.570" end="01:00:23.510" style="s2">the problem is I view self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.270" end="01:00:26.110" style="s2">like an attack and I think like if it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.510" end="01:00:29.120" style="s2">makes that turn it&#39;s a success right</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.110" end="01:00:38.900" style="s2">versus the defend which is if it ever</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.120" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">makes a mistake over I think attack is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.900" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">much more exciting way to view the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:43.880" style="s2">right eventually you want to attack and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:45.740" style="s2">then we have some people like</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.880" end="01:00:48.500" style="s2">self-driving cars with no real order to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.740" end="01:00:50.270" style="s2">look at the zero those people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.500" end="01:00:51.950" style="s2">literally sentencing thousands of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.270" end="01:00:53.630" style="s2">to die Africa right if you could build</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.950" end="01:00:55.880" style="s2">something that&#39;s twice as safe as people</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.630" end="01:00:58.070" style="s2">you save 15,000 live but we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.880" end="01:01:04.610" style="s2">even save 15,000 lives until we can save</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.070" end="01:01:13.970" style="s2">30,000 and you kind of stop hearing</p>
