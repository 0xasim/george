<p begin="00:03:50.410" end="00:03:57.820" style="s2">office still be on the torque limit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.030" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">even the height or graph for me I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.820" end="00:04:01.540" style="s2">spin you guys back around as soon as I</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.489" end="00:04:16.409" style="s2">cellphone reception here isn&#39;t the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:29.289" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s why we have a so we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">a fan the fan can run at any time so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.289" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">should keep it pretty cool pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:46.030" style="s2">though I hear this will make special</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:51.789" style="s2">frequencies you can transmit on alright</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.030" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">this is probably good let&#39;s engage here</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.789" end="00:04:55.300" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:58.259" style="s2">system is driving</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.300" end="00:04:58.259" style="s2">got the speed here</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">pretty cool guys pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.400" end="00:05:17.509" style="s2">all right so sometimes we have a fusion</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.620" end="00:05:18.770" style="s2">issue with parked cars but this one</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.509" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">looks pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.770" end="00:05:27.650" style="s2">remember always pay attention at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:30.680" style="s2">times now now unfortunately the rav4 has</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.650" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">an issue where below 20 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.680" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">will come to a full stop so that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:36.110" style="s2">totally the car but now the speeds too</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:37.639" style="s2">low so the system cancels but it will</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.110" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">bring you to a full stop it actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.639" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">should hold you behind the other car for</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:43.610" style="s2">a little bit so this is a release</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.900" end="00:05:45.620" style="s2">candidate of open piled zero point three</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.610" end="00:05:50.539" style="s2">point eight point two which should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.620" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">going live on Tuesday so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.539" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">unfortunately I have to step on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:59.150" style="s2">brake right now the system could hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:04.550" style="s2">you in brake but it can&#39;t really eight</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.150" end="00:06:06.919" style="s2">this is a limitation of the car there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.550" end="00:06:08.660" style="s2">just nothing you can really do about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.919" end="00:06:10.280" style="s2">once you go below twenty if you send the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.660" end="00:06:12.410" style="s2">command the accelerate command it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.280" end="00:06:15.139" style="s2">doesn&#39;t accelerate this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.410" end="00:06:18.190" style="s2">fixable with a firmware update mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.139" end="00:06:22.330" style="s2">going landscape you and go landscape</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.190" end="00:06:24.099" style="s2">let&#39;s go landscape turn this guy here to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.330" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.099" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">actually hang on</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.490" end="00:06:32.300" style="s2">interpretation oh yeah so you could do</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.470" end="00:06:33.889" style="s2">it with a firmware update now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.300" end="00:06:37.610" style="s2">firmware update I feel a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.889" end="00:06:39.470" style="s2">better about because this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.610" end="00:06:42.310" style="s2">gonna be a disengagement here this turns</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.470" end="00:06:42.310" style="s2">pretty steep</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.940" end="00:06:51.130" style="s2">all right I have to add to help it at</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.890" end="00:06:53.140" style="s2">the end there so we do the Toyota has a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.130" end="00:06:56.440" style="s2">much much higher torque limit than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.140" end="00:06:58.990" style="s2">Civic which is cool</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.440" end="00:07:00.610" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s so much that we limit it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.990" end="00:07:02.050" style="s2">if you see if you go to the Panda repo</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve already committed the safety code</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.050" end="00:07:08.980" style="s2">for Toyotas got a cutout here got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:10.600" style="s2">cutout cars coming to a stop we are good</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.980" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">yeah buddy</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.600" end="00:07:14.920" style="s2">all right so you&#39;re gonna see it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:17.350" style="s2">say like speed to allow in a minute yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.920" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">so okay see it says take control resume</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.350" end="00:07:27.340" style="s2">driving manually yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:29.020" style="s2">the limitation of the car</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.340" end="00:07:31.390" style="s2">yes SPT law wouldn&#39;t wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.020" end="00:07:32.920" style="s2">accelerate they&#39;re disengaged you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.390" end="00:07:35.380" style="s2">a little bit of acceleration from creep</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.920" end="00:07:38.980" style="s2">but we can&#39;t actually command any</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.380" end="00:07:42.850" style="s2">acceleration video is now sideways what</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.980" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">do you mean by that fixing that well so</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.850" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">yeah I feel very differently about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:53.540" style="s2">firmware updates to the ECU versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.370" end="00:07:55.850" style="s2">firmware updates to the steering</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.540" end="00:07:58.130" style="s2">computer so firm updates to the ECU is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.850" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">something modders have already done for</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.130" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">a long amount for of her for a while so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:06.650" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s doing life like engine</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:09.770" style="s2">boost mods are reflashing the firmware</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:11.420" style="s2">on their ECU much much safer because</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.770" end="00:08:13.430" style="s2">what&#39;s the worst your ECU can do is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.420" end="00:08:16.010" style="s2">accelerate your car I steer controller</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.430" end="00:08:17.980" style="s2">can do bad things you gotta be super</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.010" end="00:08:19.220" style="s2">super careful if you&#39;re flashing them</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.980" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:23.000" style="s2">so take control resume driving man you</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.840" end="00:08:39.729" style="s2">you want the at a steering mod will sync</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.530" end="00:08:42.530" style="s2">will see we have it but you know careful</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.729" end="00:08:44.840" style="s2">but yeah the mod to make this car work</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:46.370" style="s2">and stop and go is definitely doable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.840" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">course the system does not ship stop and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.370" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">go the Prius can do stop and go looks</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:52.070" style="s2">pretty well and rain yeah I&#39;m you were</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:24.030" style="s2">this yeah look at that torque that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.990" end="00:12:26.130" style="s2">even torque man yeah we&#39;re gonna will</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.030" end="00:12:29.970" style="s2">take Route one I&#39;ll show you guys some</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.130" end="00:12:33.000" style="s2">real some real driving the Toyota has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.970" end="00:12:35.460" style="s2">much better torque limit on the Honda so</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.000" end="00:12:40.280" style="s2">we can we could show off some real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.460" end="00:12:40.280" style="s2">real turns doing windy roads last night</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.780" end="00:12:45.460" style="s2">yeah Toyota tour club is actually so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.150" end="00:12:47.080" style="s2">high that we limit the steering tour so</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.460" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve always limited the acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.080" end="00:12:52.050" style="s2">and deceleration but we don&#39;t you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:54.910" style="s2">at the torque we limit the torque rate</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.050" end="00:12:56.590" style="s2">so it takes one point five seconds to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.910" end="00:12:57.850" style="s2">ramp up full torque and that&#39;s how I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.590" end="00:12:59.530" style="s2">feel safe driving</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.850" end="00:13:01.150" style="s2">you know without a hand necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.530" end="00:13:04.770" style="s2">touching the steering wheel because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.150" end="00:13:04.770" style="s2">know that the car can&#39;t jerk me around</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.100" end="00:13:08.670" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">but what model you&#39;re up for anything</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.559" end="00:13:18.709" style="s2">that has TSS P so we&#39;re gonna support</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:18.709" style="s2">all Toyotas with DSS P</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.970" end="00:13:28.479" style="s2">damn this thing is good all right some</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.459" end="00:13:30.609" style="s2">adaptation lanes here notice those beeps</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.479" end="00:13:33.779" style="s2">to disengage I love this guy&#39;s blind</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.100" end="00:13:48.009" style="s2">system back on</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.050" end="00:13:48.009" style="s2">whoa look at that turn get it car</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.279" end="00:13:52.809" style="s2">all right so gonna take Route one here</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.290" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">not good angle</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.380" end="00:14:32.530" style="s2">right a little fast on this term see if</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.070" end="00:14:50.440" style="s2">the Civic cannot do it maybe in the rav4</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:50.440" style="s2">can him do it oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.400" end="00:15:14.490" style="s2">speed see right there on the thing</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.480" end="00:15:45.490" style="s2">some real torque on the wheel for these</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.650" end="00:15:47.379" style="s2">turns good</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.490" end="00:15:51.579" style="s2">yes so remember this is a level two</p>
