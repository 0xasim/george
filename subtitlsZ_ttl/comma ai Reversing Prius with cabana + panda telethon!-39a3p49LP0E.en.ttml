<p begin="00:03:58.739" end="00:04:03.930" style="s2">little annoying we&#39;ll have to we&#39;ll have</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.069" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">and thirty-eight pandas so I&#39;m also on</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:23.220" style="s2">Twitter I&#39;m looking at the news and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">looking on slack I will also try to look</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">at this periscope screen so um what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing here is the video from my</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">Prius Drive correlated with the messages</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.370" style="s2">that were actually on the Prius canvas</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">at the same time okay we can we can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.370" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">can go to landscape mode let&#39;s let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:48.690" style="s2">what we can do here these phone mounts</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">this isn&#39;t really how phones are meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.690" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">to be used I don&#39;t think this does this</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">that I think the the portrait was better</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">um an update to do what so we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">probably release a firmware update in</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:12.780" style="s2">the next week that starts to add some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:16.669" style="s2">the so all of the software functionality</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.780" end="00:05:18.810" style="s2">like the elm327 emulation mode and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.669" end="00:05:20.970" style="s2">windows support and the linux driver</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.810" end="00:05:22.710" style="s2">support that&#39;s all gonna work on Revie</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.970" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">as well support more car as well if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.710" end="00:05:27.289" style="s2">want to support more cars oh oh the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:32.310" style="s2">support more cars with the pandas yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:35.460" style="s2">so yeah I mean some cars don&#39;t expose</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.310" end="00:05:37.200" style="s2">that much on the OBD port and will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.460" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">constrained to getting sort of the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.200" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">things that the typical dongles get</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:42.390" style="s2">because the manufacturers just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:44.830" style="s2">put the data there now you can get</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.390" end="00:05:46.920" style="s2">around this by wiring the Panda</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.830" end="00:05:50.200" style="s2">correctly into the canvas of your car</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.920" end="00:05:56.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s less hard to do than it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.200" end="00:05:58.870" style="s2">and okay here we are so this is a plot</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.110" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">of the wheel speed and the Prius now</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.870" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">let&#39;s see what we can find here so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">think this signal is the brake see if</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:14.550" style="s2">that&#39;s true this is the brake amount now</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:18.490" style="s2">on a Prius you have two kinds of brake</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.550" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">you have the regen bike and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.490" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">physical brake now I don&#39;t like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">clicking here how it&#39;s jumping to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:31.300" style="s2">next thing I thought this bug was fixed</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:35.590" style="s2">let&#39;s try refreshing again and see what</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.300" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">we get and we are up to three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.590" end="00:06:41.770" style="s2">and forty one pandas &#39;im one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:46.210" style="s2">really cool things about this whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.770" end="00:06:48.280" style="s2">ecosystem is you&#39;re not constrained to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.210" end="00:06:51.190" style="s2">use like when you log the data</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.280" end="00:06:52.290" style="s2">it literally logs all of the data from</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.190" end="00:06:55.600" style="s2">your car</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:58.630" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t just log what we understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.600" end="00:07:01.660" style="s2">now so when you log it you can look in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.630" end="00:07:03.310" style="s2">the future if somebody figures out where</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.660" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">a signal is on a car you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.310" end="00:07:12.340" style="s2">get access to information on all your</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:15.460" style="s2">pasture outs as well all right now it</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.340" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">looks fixed looks fixed until I scroll</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.460" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.009" end="00:07:40.739" style="s2">also yeah we need to stand up a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.469" end="00:07:44.729" style="s2">so the demo link has been posted all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.739" end="00:07:48.539" style="s2">articles and literally we&#39;re getting you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.729" end="00:07:50.159" style="s2">know hundreds of hits per minute to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.539" end="00:07:53.179" style="s2">interface so that&#39;s why everything&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.159" end="00:07:55.289" style="s2">little bit laggy and slow okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.179" end="00:07:58.259" style="s2">you see what&#39;s happening when I click</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.289" end="00:08:01.529" style="s2">there it&#39;s jumping clicks here and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.259" end="00:08:03.359" style="s2">it jumps let&#39;s see if we can uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.529" end="00:08:05.309" style="s2">see if we can go on slack here and get</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.359" end="00:08:06.929" style="s2">Andy over here to take a look and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.309" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">speculate at what might be happening so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.929" end="00:08:13.969" style="s2">this app is written in react it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:13.969" style="s2">easy to go in and push changes out</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.919" end="00:08:25.459" style="s2">seeing a cabana bug on the live stream</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.370" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">yeah so these these these lines are here</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:50.279" style="s2">which has something to do with it at</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">times not being synced correctly hey</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.279" end="00:08:54.040" style="s2">welcome to the welcome to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">livestreams everybody want to welcome my</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.209" end="00:09:03.110" style="s2">so Andrew here is the one who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:06.910" style="s2">cabana and I&#39;ll show you the bug mercy</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.110" end="00:09:10.820" style="s2">so when I click</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">here it jumps</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.820" end="00:09:16.700" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m cooking here and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">thought we fixed this I&#39;m also still</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.700" end="00:09:21.710" style="s2">seeing the lines in the graph it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2">seem to happen on the first Prius</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.710" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">segment it seems to only happen when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.300" end="00:09:40.340" style="s2">scroll to the next for your segments we</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">play a live internal version so I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.340" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">use the live internal version on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:52.820" style="s2">periscope and then once we do all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:55.130" style="s2">bug fixes we&#39;ll push it out Devon so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.820" end="00:09:57.140" style="s2">yeah this is why this is why we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.130" end="00:10:05.810" style="s2">teams of people working to make this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.140" end="00:10:07.570" style="s2">stuff stable and great let&#39;s go over</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.810" end="00:10:10.250" style="s2">here and look at our pan anniversary so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.570" end="00:10:18.140" style="s2">344 keep become more pandas more pandas</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.250" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">more pandas so some of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.140" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">want to look for in order to make the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:28.730" style="s2">Prius supported by open pilot is how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:32.660" style="s2">Prius is actually controlling the brakes</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.730" end="00:10:35.810" style="s2">and the steering so this brake packet</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.660" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">here looks to be the actual brake that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.810" end="00:10:40.310" style="s2">the car is doing but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:42.590" style="s2">necessarily the command that you send to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.310" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">the car in order to trigger a braking</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.590" end="00:10:47.480" style="s2">event so for that what we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:49.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll find in the video so if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.480" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">remember everybody saw me do this Drive</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.280" end="00:10:55.930" style="s2">we can find where the the ACC hit the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:10:59.930" style="s2">brakes</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.930" end="00:11:03.080" style="s2">probably this thing yeah right so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.930" end="00:11:05.150" style="s2">can see that I&#39;m coming to a stop there</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.080" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">see how it&#39;s out of sync right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.150" end="00:11:12.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the bug we gotta fix it should be</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:14.089" style="s2">much better in sync and then what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.110" end="00:11:15.980" style="s2">seeing right now if we go over the demo</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.089" end="00:11:18.389" style="s2">route could show you how long</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.980" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">we think it is so actually anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.389" end="00:11:26.610" style="s2">go to this URL community.com AI slash</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">Cabana question mark demo equals one so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.610" end="00:11:31.500" style="s2">this is the demo route from the acura</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.670" end="00:11:34.620" style="s2">you&#39;ll see on this one when I pull out</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.500" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">the steering angle when I go unlike to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.620" end="00:11:38.490" style="s2">the powertrain data I plot the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:42.389" style="s2">transmission speed you&#39;ll see it sync up</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.490" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">really well so you see when I click on</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.389" end="00:11:46.829" style="s2">this here we&#39;re gonna see the car</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:49.019" style="s2">decelerate at the stop sign you can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.829" end="00:11:51.750" style="s2">how that&#39;s correlated right there we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.019" end="00:11:55.910" style="s2">come to it was that not a complete stop</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.750" end="00:11:58.980" style="s2">that graph did not touch the access</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.910" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">fortunately the police don&#39;t have api&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.980" end="00:12:02.910" style="s2">so we can&#39;t report you to the police so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.740" end="00:12:07.470" style="s2">we&#39;d never do anything like that because</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.910" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">we&#39;re not terrible people but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.470" end="00:12:12.180" style="s2">can see coming in first stop and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:14.579" style="s2">cool we can actually use speed profiles</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.180" end="00:12:17.129" style="s2">that look like this in the machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.579" end="00:12:19.079" style="s2">learning to determine where stop signs</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.129" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">are without having to use any visual</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.079" end="00:12:24.029" style="s2">features at all to determine the stop</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:25.620" style="s2">sign so yeah I mean you expect this here</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.029" end="00:12:27.300" style="s2">to be a turn you can see it&#39;s a turn</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.620" end="00:12:29.939" style="s2">that&#39;s the steering angle so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.300" end="00:12:31.439" style="s2">lot of stuff already figured out on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.939" end="00:12:33.389" style="s2">Acura but there&#39;s a few things that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.439" end="00:12:36.809" style="s2">don&#39;t have figured out so there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.389" end="00:12:38.129" style="s2">like xxx 4 packet so if you look at this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.809" end="00:12:41.189" style="s2">packet you&#39;ll notice that there are no</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.129" end="00:12:43.589" style="s2">signals labeled for it this one always</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.189" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">seems to have that value let&#39;s highlight</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.589" end="00:12:51.779" style="s2">it and create a signal let&#39;s plot it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:54.209" style="s2">see if it ever changes nope it looks</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.779" end="00:12:58.189" style="s2">very boring maybe there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.209" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">interesting on xxx for about xxx one</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.189" end="00:13:02.550" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty boring as well so you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:04.439" style="s2">kind of see how interesting a packets</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.550" end="00:13:09.540" style="s2">gonna be by looking at how red it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.439" end="00:13:12.449" style="s2">over here in the signal explorer red</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.540" end="00:13:15.000" style="s2">means that it&#39;s changing so if we look</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.449" end="00:13:17.850" style="s2">at these ones down here these are</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.000" end="00:13:20.600" style="s2">actually packets from the radar so</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:23.639" style="s2">they&#39;re not filled in on this DBC</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.600" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">because this is the accurate DBC and not</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.639" end="00:13:28.110" style="s2">the radar did you say but if I go here</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">and I plot this signal you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.110" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s going to correspond to how close</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.779" style="s2">so I am to the car in front of me so let</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:35.220" style="s2">me just zoom in here and you&#39;ll see if</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.779" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">you can see in the video you can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.220" end="00:13:41.930" style="s2">that car off in the distance there you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">can see that we&#39;re getting closer to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.930" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there&#39;s even much better</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:50.580" style="s2">examples of that yes that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:54.029" style="s2">radar the first radar thing usually ends</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.580" end="00:13:55.709" style="s2">up being the lead and this route is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.029" end="00:13:58.589" style="s2">available to everybody so you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.709" end="00:14:02.300" style="s2">actually play along with me at home um</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.589" end="00:14:02.300" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we coming up on a car here</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.839" end="00:14:09.140" style="s2">let&#39;s move this over and let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.910" end="00:14:09.140" style="s2">that works on the demo route</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.590" end="00:14:27.340" style="s2">hmm I&#39;m seeing the same sync issues on</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.050" end="00:14:32.410" style="s2">the demo route that I was seeing with</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.340" end="00:14:36.070" style="s2">the other route so I just have to wait -</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.410" end="00:14:38.110" style="s2">let&#39;s fix so there&#39;s so much can data on</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.070" end="00:14:40.360" style="s2">your car that it&#39;s hard to load it into</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.110" end="00:14:42.220" style="s2">the memory of the web browser all at</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.360" end="00:14:44.020" style="s2">once so that&#39;s why we have this slider</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.220" end="00:14:45.400" style="s2">here which lets you select the portion</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.020" end="00:14:48.910" style="s2">of your route that you&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.400" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">working with needs to only work right</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.910" end="00:14:53.910" style="s2">now on the first portion of the route</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:53.910" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll be fixed up soon</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.630" end="00:14:58.510" style="s2">let&#39;s see I didn&#39;t email so they should</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.920" end="00:15:04.029" style="s2">be sure we have public email or</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:05.589" style="s2">everything else very interesting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.029" end="00:15:07.630" style="s2">probably not interesting I usually get</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.589" end="00:15:10.420" style="s2">emails for people who want to and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.630" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">quote like collaborate on ideas and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.420" end="00:15:14.650" style="s2">like okay so what&#39;s the idea I tell them</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">to be concrete sure if they know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.650" end="00:15:18.490" style="s2">concrete means because I very rarely get</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:20.470" style="s2">like a concrete proposal like I want</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.490" end="00:15:22.330" style="s2">this or we have this or let&#39;s make these</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.470" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2">two systems work together it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.330" end="00:15:27.070" style="s2">let&#39;s meet for coffee and chat and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.850" end="00:15:28.920" style="s2">know I would drink way too much coffee</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.070" end="00:15:36.520" style="s2">if I took everybody up on those offers</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.920" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">and that wouldn&#39;t work I mean any any</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.520" end="00:15:40.180" style="s2">sorta and it like VCS complain about</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:43.150" style="s2">this all the time - it like come to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.180" end="00:15:47.110" style="s2">with like a real pitch let&#39;s check out</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.150" end="00:15:48.940" style="s2">the panel&#39;s it&#39;s a panda huh okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.110" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">someone sent me a email with the subject</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.940" end="00:15:54.220" style="s2">batteries I think it&#39;s interesting do I</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:55.450" style="s2">know anything about batteries let me</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.220" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">read the email we&#39;ll see if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:18.770" style="s2">these tools to be a a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.750" end="00:24:20.180" style="s2">experience to use as a program that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.770" end="00:24:21.800" style="s2">used for a lot of binary reverse</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.180" end="00:24:23.750" style="s2">engineering called Ida and it really is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.800" end="00:24:28.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a wonderful program to use and you</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.999" style="s2">365 pandas I do promise that these bugs</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.479" end="00:25:30.479" style="s2">will be fixed long long before you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.999" end="00:25:33.359" style="s2">your panda they&#39;ll even be fixed tonight</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.980" end="00:26:31.019" style="s2">to here I mean a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.539" end="00:26:35.649" style="s2">bugs are caused by people clicking wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.019" end="00:26:38.889" style="s2">yeah 368 pandas um if you have a panda</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.649" end="00:26:41.230" style="s2">can others go through the data so know</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.889" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">if you have a panda that data we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.230" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">share your data with anybody um we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:47.139" style="s2">people are asking a lot for that feature</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:52.090" style="s2">if they want to be able to share their</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:42.460" style="s2">and he disappears when the bug happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.649" end="00:27:46.100" style="s2">he&#39;s not here we go</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.460" end="00:27:48.919" style="s2">save your GBC progress I did I already</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.100" end="00:27:51.529" style="s2">saved it come in today github so if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.919" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">see cabana integrates with the open DBC</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.529" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">project 370 pandas um cabana integrates</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">with the opened DBC project so I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:03.529" style="s2">load my DB C&#39;s here and I can fork it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:05.480" style="s2">my own github so then if I want to save</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.529" end="00:28:07.789" style="s2">my progress I can just go to save DBC</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.480" end="00:28:10.730" style="s2">and notice how its forked to geo hot</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.789" end="00:28:14.260" style="s2">open DBC I can just click commit to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.730" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">github and now it&#39;s shared on my github</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.260" end="00:28:19.640" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:24.260" style="s2">so Andy sent me a link to an internal</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.640" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">build of Cabana so fast will make the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.260" end="00:28:28.039" style="s2">real one faster we&#39;ll stand by our</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:32.390" style="s2">caching server in front of the web page</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.039" end="00:28:35.380" style="s2">so let me just log in to this can I log</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.390" end="00:28:38.740" style="s2">into this with github is that gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.380" end="00:28:38.740" style="s2">no oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:43.610" style="s2">because it won&#39;t redirect me the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.490" end="00:28:47.720" style="s2">URL okay okay so no DBC but let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.610" end="00:28:49.130" style="s2">the bugs that I could save to a text</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.720" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">file so you don&#39;t have to save your DBC</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">is to open DV city you can save them to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">text files so I like scroll to here</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.340" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">speed now you know where that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">I just called my get up here go to my</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:13.429" style="s2">personal gate on github geo hot open BBC</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:15.169" style="s2">there we can look in these DBC file so</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.429" end="00:29:21.830" style="s2">DBC is kind of the industry standard</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.169" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">file for car or specifications a shale</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.830" end="00:29:24.860" style="s2">is sensors are in your car so these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:26.510" style="s2">the wheel sensors for my car so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.860" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">see their own packet 170 which i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.510" end="00:29:41.270" style="s2">is a a and hex what&#39;s not doing it now</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:31.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know hey yeah Cabana Cabana is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.630" end="00:30:33.350" style="s2">web app yeah wow that&#39;s true that we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.220" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">an internal betting pool for how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.350" end="00:30:41.320" style="s2">pandas we were gonna sell and if you bet</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:41.320" style="s2">on a lot of pant as you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.879" end="00:30:50.440" style="s2">a cow that we have bug-free open DBC</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.649" end="00:30:55.579" style="s2">that bug-free you&#39;ll always be bugs bugs</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.389" end="00:30:58.879" style="s2">are bugs are on going forever struggle</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.579" end="00:31:02.509" style="s2">um so yeah you just paste your DBC in</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.879" end="00:31:07.369" style="s2">here so it&#39;s gonna raw select all copy</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.509" end="00:31:11.509" style="s2">you go here paste continue editing from</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.369" end="00:31:14.419" style="s2">paste oh I see very high quality okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.509" end="00:31:16.339" style="s2">cool so now we have those signals we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.419" end="00:31:18.229" style="s2">were working with before and look look</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.339" end="00:31:20.659" style="s2">look the lines are gone and now when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.229" end="00:31:23.599" style="s2">click on the graph notice how it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.659" end="00:31:29.149" style="s2">actually goes to the correct place so</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.599" end="00:31:31.609" style="s2">let&#39;s try to find where where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.149" end="00:31:34.429" style="s2">breaking is happening so the car had the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.609" end="00:31:36.169" style="s2">adaptive cruise control on I believe at</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.429" end="00:31:38.809" style="s2">this point you guys probably watch this</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.169" end="00:31:41.329" style="s2">video how does a t-mobile sync up differ</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.809" end="00:31:43.009" style="s2">from a t-mobile sync up drive device do</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.329" end="00:31:45.739" style="s2">you think t-mobile would ever make an</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.009" end="00:31:47.539" style="s2">interface that looks like this I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.739" end="00:31:50.059" style="s2">the t-mobile Drive device tells you how</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.539" end="00:31:51.289" style="s2">many miles you drove maybe so much I</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.059" end="00:31:54.499" style="s2">sure but it&#39;s so much from a screenshot</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.289" end="00:31:56.509" style="s2">of that so how does it differ it gives</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.499" end="00:32:00.229" style="s2">you a whole lot more access to your car</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.509" end="00:32:02.209" style="s2">than any other reasonably priced dongle</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.229" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">that had come before in the past if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.209" end="00:32:05.199" style="s2">wanted this kind of access you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:06.499" style="s2">buying things from companies like</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.199" end="00:32:09.799" style="s2">cabassa</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.499" end="00:32:12.019" style="s2">for for $2000 this competes with really</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.799" end="00:32:16.069" style="s2">the dongles that the manufacturers use</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.019" end="00:32:17.989" style="s2">not the consumer grade ones ok cool so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.069" end="00:32:19.639" style="s2">let&#39;s assume that this braking event</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.989" end="00:32:21.289" style="s2">here so you can see it&#39;s a braking event</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.639" end="00:32:23.569" style="s2">because we lose a lot of speed quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.289" end="00:32:26.749" style="s2">let&#39;s assume that this braking event</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.569" end="00:32:30.739" style="s2">here was caused by the ACC being</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.749" end="00:32:33.949" style="s2">triggered right so I have down here a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.739" end="00:32:36.319" style="s2">new message one one of these is ah here</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.949" end="00:32:41.059" style="s2">we go see that this one here track is</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.319" end="00:32:42.319" style="s2">zero is the so these you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.059" end="00:32:44.839" style="s2">some of these are zeros and some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.319" end="00:32:46.759" style="s2">these are ones zeros are on the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.839" end="00:32:49.190" style="s2">canvas and ones are on the second canvas</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.759" end="00:32:51.139" style="s2">so I can go down here to this track is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.190" end="00:32:53.149" style="s2">zero one and I can plot the longitudinal</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.139" end="00:32:55.219" style="s2">distance to the car in front of me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.149" end="00:32:56.690" style="s2">this makes a lot of sense you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.219" end="00:32:59.720" style="s2">that as I approach the car</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.690" end="00:33:03.350" style="s2">well I think actually the target changes</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.720" end="00:33:06.050" style="s2">there so I think here this is a packet</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.350" end="00:33:10.370" style="s2">from the radar in the Prius so you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.050" end="00:33:13.640" style="s2">see that here it&#39;s tracking this car</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.370" end="00:33:15.950" style="s2">over on the left and then once that car</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.640" end="00:33:18.050" style="s2">leaves like the cone of influence it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.950" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">switches over to this car and you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.050" end="00:33:25.250" style="s2">see that kind of parabolic parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">braking this by the way is not how you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.250" end="00:33:30.380" style="s2">want to really do it this was kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.770" end="00:33:31.520" style="s2">uncomfortable braking event I talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.380" end="00:33:33.290" style="s2">about this during the last livestream</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.520" end="00:33:35.420" style="s2">but but a limo driver school they tell</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.290" end="00:33:39.290" style="s2">you be hard on the brakes at first and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.420" end="00:33:42.590" style="s2">then soften up as time goes on okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.290" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">we have our wheel speed we have our</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.590" end="00:33:47.750" style="s2">longitudinal distance let&#39;s take a look</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:49.790" style="s2">here at the brake package so to confirm</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:52.700" style="s2">that this actually is the brake pedal I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.790" end="00:33:54.680" style="s2">would expect oh it&#39;s not really the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.700" end="00:33:58.340" style="s2">brake pedal because I didn&#39;t press the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.680" end="00:34:00.170" style="s2">brake pedal this was done automatically</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.340" end="00:34:01.850" style="s2">by the cruise control so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.170" end="00:34:04.490" style="s2">should rename this to something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:11.629" style="s2">makes more sense maybe this one will</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.490" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">call brake Bri J you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.629" end="00:34:14.840" style="s2">reverse engineering you just take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:17.840" style="s2">of guesses at names and then you make it</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.840" end="00:34:19.399" style="s2">better and better over time and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.840" end="00:34:24.590" style="s2">gonna be an ongoing project and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.399" end="00:34:28.190" style="s2">call this one brake mount you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.590" end="00:34:29.600" style="s2">this is all reactive that version is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.190" end="00:34:32.810" style="s2">deployed live now cool the bug is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.600" end="00:34:36.980" style="s2">already fixed for everybody that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.810" end="00:34:39.800" style="s2">that was quick let&#39;s say thank you Andy</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.980" end="00:34:41.540" style="s2">on slack what do you say thanks because</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.800" end="00:34:45.429" style="s2">it&#39;d be stupid if I said thank you Andy</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.540" end="00:34:45.429" style="s2">on the slack Channel that&#39;s a DM Jam</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.790" end="00:34:52.899" style="s2">let&#39;s check the Twitter I love Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.100" end="00:35:04.290" style="s2">cool okay so back to finding the break</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:06.660" style="s2">packet so it&#39;s possible that one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.290" end="00:35:09.450" style="s2">these things was actually the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.660" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">for the break though doubtful I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.450" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">way we could test this as we could find</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:14.490" style="s2">another place in the route that I know I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:19.250" style="s2">braked without using the adaptive cruise</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.490" end="00:35:21.570" style="s2">control for now let&#39;s just unplug these</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.250" end="00:35:23.870" style="s2">and I know that it&#39;s not gonna be on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.570" end="00:35:27.050" style="s2">radar can so I can use this filter here</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.870" end="00:35:30.030" style="s2">how am I going to say 0 : is the filter</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.050" end="00:35:31.490" style="s2">so it has to be one of these packets</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.030" end="00:35:36.410" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can find one that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.490" end="00:35:39.300" style="s2">changes right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.410" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">how&#39;s kind of tempting this new message</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.300" end="00:35:45.620" style="s2">one over here and this signal here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:49.650" style="s2">try plotting that seeing what we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.620" end="00:35:51.930" style="s2">okay well there&#39;s a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.650" end="00:35:55.890" style="s2">bouncing around zero that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.930" end="00:35:59.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually a it&#39;s signed</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.890" end="00:36:05.070" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s signed 102 zero just has a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.670" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">special meaning interesting I wonder I</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.070" end="00:36:09.780" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that signal is doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.630" end="00:36:11.250" style="s2">have any ideas don&#39;t think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.780" end="00:36:13.980" style="s2">signal that actually triggers the break</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.250" end="00:36:18.590" style="s2">though I might have also kind of lined</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.980" end="00:36:18.590" style="s2">it up long so let me try going there</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.740" end="00:36:32.190" style="s2">okay so that looks a whole lot more</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">sensible notice how this graph really</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.190" end="00:36:38.490" style="s2">improved a lot um this looks more like</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:43.109" style="s2">to me is probably something like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.490" end="00:36:46.770" style="s2">accelerometer right so this is Excel or</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.109" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">on excel um and then when you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.770" end="00:36:52.349" style="s2">talking in a car frame of a car the car</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:54.690" style="s2">travels forward in the X direction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.349" end="00:37:01.170" style="s2">then Y is to the left so I&#39;m gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.690" end="00:37:02.460" style="s2">this excel X so I missed that question</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.170" end="00:37:03.780" style="s2">haven&#39;t been good at keeping up with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.460" end="00:37:05.880" style="s2">periscope because the things a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.780" end="00:37:10.380" style="s2">bit behind what my eyes are looking when</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.880" end="00:37:11.339" style="s2">I&#39;m on the screen yes and that looks</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">like that just looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.339" end="00:37:27.450" style="s2">accelerometer you know what this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">probably Excel Y to Y value so we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.450" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">actually confirm if that&#39;s correct so</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of noise I don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:35.970" style="s2">how small the numbers are but we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:38.670" style="s2">confirm if that&#39;s correct by plotting it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.970" end="00:37:40.290" style="s2">with the steering angle and finding a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.670" end="00:37:44.700" style="s2">place in the segment where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.290" end="00:37:46.230" style="s2">steer the car so that&#39;s Excel ax so</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.700" end="00:37:47.549" style="s2">that&#39;s breaking of the car but do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.230" end="00:37:51.720" style="s2">have a place where we steer here was</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.549" end="00:37:54.599" style="s2">first year still a lot and you reduced</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.720" end="00:37:55.410" style="s2">you a lot okay maybe that&#39;s not Excel</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.599" end="00:38:04.530" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.410" end="00:38:06.510" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s Excel Z what was another</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.530" end="00:38:09.569" style="s2">thing in there but yeah it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.510" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">like acceleration in the Z direction but</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.569" end="00:38:15.930" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole lot harder to test so</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:20.700" style="s2">let&#39;s shift record the phone</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.930" end="00:38:23.579" style="s2">accelerometer it does um we should make</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.700" end="00:38:25.140" style="s2">it so you can graph that as well that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.579" end="00:38:29.000" style="s2">would be a good idea we can then just</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.140" end="00:38:29.000" style="s2">correspond them you know very simply</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.670" end="00:38:37.170" style="s2">I spell that right these Google things</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.640" end="00:38:42.990" style="s2">to see if I spelled it right - I spent -</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.170" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">right okay but that&#39;s not we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.990" end="00:38:46.440" style="s2">for we are looking for the brakes so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:50.190" style="s2">let&#39;s just remove that signal there or</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.440" end="00:38:53.730" style="s2">get on plot hold this and let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:39:00.630" style="s2">to our good breaking event so this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.730" end="00:39:03.690" style="s2">our good braking event here so the radar</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.630" end="00:39:06.450" style="s2">is gone let&#39;s so you can go a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.690" end="00:39:09.150" style="s2">before the braking events let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.450" end="00:39:09.690" style="s2">we can figure out what changes look over</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.150" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.690" end="00:39:17.730" style="s2">figure out what changes in order to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:21.750" style="s2">trigger that these packets look like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.730" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">they become active but that might just</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.750" end="00:39:31.860" style="s2">be the speed over here no it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.910" style="s2">not I always plot bad and you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.860" end="00:39:36.610" style="s2">it it&#39;s assigned value so let&#39;s um let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.910" end="00:39:39.729" style="s2">make it signed</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.610" end="00:39:39.729" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.190" end="00:39:50.200" style="s2">hmm okay that looks like something maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:54.039" style="s2">this is the signal that controls the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.200" end="00:39:57.369" style="s2">brakes a good kind of way that I found</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.039" end="00:40:00.490" style="s2">to do this was let&#39;s look at what else</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.369" end="00:40:03.609" style="s2">is in this same packet maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.490" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">guess so another thing that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.609" end="00:40:11.890" style="s2">have soon as well is live cabana mode um</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:14.230" style="s2">so you&#39;re not going to need to upload</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.890" end="00:40:16.630" style="s2">your route to shiver wait and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.230" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">process it in the past you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.630" end="00:40:21.130" style="s2">do this all locally in real time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:22.930" style="s2">gonna write some JavaScript code using</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.130" end="00:40:25.480" style="s2">web USB which will just let you plug</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.930" end="00:40:30.430" style="s2">your panda into your computer go to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.480" end="00:40:32.170" style="s2">cabanaconde i and then run it right</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.430" end="00:40:34.869" style="s2">there kind of like if you guys have used</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.170" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">like my ether wallet you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.869" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">JavaScript based if you&#39;re in wallet but</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.539" style="s2">it can talk to your physical like</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:43.510" style="s2">cryptocurrency like just ledger so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.539" end="00:40:45.609" style="s2">the same kind of thing okay so these</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.510" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">signals might be something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.609" end="00:40:54.609" style="s2">the brakes they&#39;re kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:56.650" style="s2">oh well okay so the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.609" end="00:40:59.069" style="s2">gonna have to check and compare it to is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.650" end="00:41:00.910" style="s2">other places where the brakes are used</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.069" end="00:41:02.859" style="s2">we want to find the one where it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.910" end="00:41:05.140" style="s2">autonomous on the brakes and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.859" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">think it&#39;s this because this just looks</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.140" end="00:41:09.460" style="s2">like it correlates with that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:13.150" style="s2">it correlates with the acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.460" end="00:41:15.190" style="s2">there right like so yeah I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.150" end="00:41:17.289" style="s2">know what this signal is just offhand</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.190" end="00:41:20.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s not what we&#39;re looking for I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.289" end="00:41:20.039" style="s2">can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.680" end="00:41:37.720" style="s2">it&#39;s are tempting because they&#39;re quiet</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.079" end="00:41:43.390" style="s2">and then they come alive that stuff when</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.720" end="00:41:44.920" style="s2">the breaking happens yes panda can read</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.390" end="00:41:46.749" style="s2">and write to the canvas but when it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:11.529" style="s2">first time you do it do urge you to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.579" end="00:42:12.970" style="s2">careful but at least when it&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.759" end="00:42:22.839" style="s2">compatible with Panda to take control of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.980" end="00:42:26.650" style="s2">the gas steering in breaks I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.839" end="00:42:29.049" style="s2">I don&#39;t have that time but if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.650" end="00:42:30.789" style="s2">what we do for the Prius you can use the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.049" end="00:42:32.470" style="s2">same procedure to determine if you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.789" end="00:42:35.710" style="s2">if your car has adaptive cruise control</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.470" end="00:42:37.509" style="s2">and Lane keep assist like if you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.710" end="00:42:39.700" style="s2">the car hit the brakes or move the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.509" end="00:42:41.349" style="s2">steering wheel then there&#39;s a good bet</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.700" end="00:42:42.999" style="s2">that you&#39;ll be able to do with Panda um</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.349" end="00:42:45.069" style="s2">if you&#39;ve never seen the car move the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.999" end="00:42:47.759" style="s2">steering wheel by itself then they</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.069" end="00:42:47.759" style="s2">probably can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:43:01.070" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s focus on what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">doing all the Twitter notifications are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.070" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">so tempting I love Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.320" end="00:43:22.980" style="s2">so you see what I&#39;m looking for here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.790" end="00:43:27.080" style="s2">looking for a signal that&#39;s gonna light</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.980" end="00:43:29.840" style="s2">up right when that breaking event starts</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.080" end="00:43:34.440" style="s2">so now there are there are worse</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.840" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">possibilities it is remotely possible so</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.440" end="00:43:37.470" style="s2">these signals you notice they have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:39.420" style="s2">less frequency than these signals and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.470" end="00:43:40.530" style="s2">this is the count that happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.420" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">three minute chunk that I&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.530" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">looking at so it&#39;s probably one of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:49.530" style="s2">more frequent signals than breaks</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:52.260" style="s2">usually update pretty fast yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.530" end="00:43:54.660" style="s2">common neo the board that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.260" end="00:43:57.210" style="s2">common neo is kind of like a rev one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.660" end="00:43:58.500" style="s2">the Panda I&#39;m finding gas break events</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.210" end="00:44:00.390" style="s2">is actually really easy you can get</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.500" end="00:44:02.280" style="s2">finding the speed on a car it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.390" end="00:44:03.900" style="s2">usually you know trivial you can just</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.280" end="00:44:06.690" style="s2">spot it because it&#39;s Carlino with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.900" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">video but yeah we should be plotting we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.690" end="00:44:10.200" style="s2">can get GPS speed we got accelerometer</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:11.910" style="s2">and we can put all that data in the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.200" end="00:44:15.560" style="s2">format that you see here and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.910" end="00:44:17.730" style="s2">able to graph it coming soon to cabana</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.560" end="00:44:20.010" style="s2">yes so and you know actually if you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.730" end="00:44:21.510" style="s2">a neo right now you can go on the day I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.010" end="00:44:24.080" style="s2">think Explorer and you can use Cabana</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.510" end="00:44:28.740" style="s2">and you can do what I&#39;m doing right here</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.080" end="00:44:33.930" style="s2">come on your own drives panda is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.740" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">just like the v2 of that hardware if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.930" end="00:44:38.520" style="s2">put your car into a lower gear the brake</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:40.470" style="s2">does push in automatically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.520" end="00:44:45.570" style="s2">talking about like like engine braking</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.470" end="00:44:46.830" style="s2">or actual like braking so even if the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.570" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">car can&#39;t move the steering wheel or</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.830" end="00:44:52.140" style="s2">brakes there&#39;s a possibility you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:53.730" style="s2">able to control it but it gets it gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.140" end="00:44:55.500" style="s2">tricky and fancy at that point you might</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.730" end="00:44:58.050" style="s2">need to like change the firmware that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.500" end="00:45:01.700" style="s2">running on your car it is it is doable</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.050" end="00:45:01.700" style="s2">but um you know be careful</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.290" end="00:45:15.600" style="s2">this is the break it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:17.970" style="s2">that the break that the computerized</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.600" end="00:45:20.580" style="s2">brake shows up on the same graph as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.970" end="00:45:24.450" style="s2">human brake on the Honda this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.580" end="00:45:26.360" style="s2">case then it just doesn&#39;t break hold for</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.450" end="00:45:28.650" style="s2">you that&#39;s pretty smooth pretty cold</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.360" end="00:45:31.620" style="s2">let&#39;s confirm that that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.650" end="00:45:32.600" style="s2">brake all the time even when I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.620" end="00:45:36.180" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.600" end="00:45:40.980" style="s2">yeah the ACC was not driving there I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:42.870" style="s2">driving there so that is a human brake</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.980" end="00:45:49.320" style="s2">event and it&#39;s on the same axis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.870" end="00:45:51.990" style="s2">gonna break hold see that you see that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.320" end="00:45:55.830" style="s2">see that linear see that linear up right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.990" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">there that feels super uncomfortable you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.830" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">want to brake hard in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">which it did but then it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">whatever its controller was wasn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">calibrated and had this linear op not to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:09.960" style="s2">be fair that&#39;s after the car looks stops</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:11.400" style="s2">so maybe it maybe it&#39;s this because I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.960" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">remember the brake event feeling really</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.400" end="00:46:20.250" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:22.980" style="s2">oh okay so I&#39;m not actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.250" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">remote one I&#39;m on Andy&#39;s local one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.980" end="00:46:34.910" style="s2">do you erase my DBC and said you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:37.290" style="s2">refreshed it yeah also ejected the rila</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.910" end="00:46:39.630" style="s2">no eyes I didn&#39;t have anything really</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.290" end="00:46:45.300" style="s2">figured out anyway that was the leader</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.630" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">was not at the driving school so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.300" end="00:46:52.230" style="s2">go in here to route we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:56.850" style="s2">and let&#39;s see if that bug fix actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.230" end="00:46:58.050" style="s2">did go live well so that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.850" end="00:46:59.970" style="s2">actually happen on the real one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.050" end="00:47:05.450" style="s2">just cuz it&#39;s in our reaction debugging</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.970" end="00:47:09.840" style="s2">mode oh man it feels slow on the server</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.240" end="00:50:04.350" style="s2">on Mazdas maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.440" end="00:50:17.960" style="s2">reverse engineering requires a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:31.070" style="s2">well we will stick a a version on cabana</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.010" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">so you&#39;ll be able to know when which</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.070" end="00:50:34.760" style="s2">which which version you are or 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:36.230" style="s2">employees that&#39;s true should we update</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.880" end="00:59:40.199" style="s2">the more of these we get out there the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.380" end="00:59:40.199" style="s2">more open hopefully cars will become</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.209" end="00:59:45.209" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.410" end="01:00:04.320" style="s2">so let&#39;s rename this message also had</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.460" end="01:00:05.730" style="s2">auto population of the size of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.320" end="01:00:09.150" style="s2">messages cuz actually think this might</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.730" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">be a shorter message I mean we know how</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.150" end="01:00:13.260" style="s2">big the messages are on the bus yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:14.970" style="s2">most of this is just trial and error</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.260" end="01:00:16.140" style="s2">just kind of guessing and drawing plots</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.970" end="01:00:18.780" style="s2">and being like hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.140" end="01:00:20.700" style="s2">does that look right like I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.780" end="01:00:24.119" style="s2">don&#39;t know what this is so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.700" end="01:00:26.820" style="s2">draw a graph of it and let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.119" end="01:00:29.850" style="s2">very noisy well that&#39;s probably because</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.820" end="01:00:37.260" style="s2">these aren&#39;t all the same signal or</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.850" end="01:00:38.970" style="s2">maybe just is that noisy oh no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.260" end="01:00:42.570" style="s2">other things you can tweak too like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.970" end="01:00:45.030" style="s2">nd in this so actually we have it if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.570" end="01:00:46.440" style="s2">drag it like this it&#39;s little-endian and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.030" end="01:00:48.990" style="s2">then you drag it the other way it&#39;s big</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.440" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">endian you can also change that nd in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.990" end="01:00:51.720" style="s2">this right here but let&#39;s remove those</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.400" end="01:00:55.710" style="s2">signals those don&#39;t look like anything</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.720" end="01:00:57.180" style="s2">good so yeah I mean things just a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.710" end="01:00:58.260" style="s2">fun to play with you can sit here and</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.180" end="01:00:59.730" style="s2">just look through all the signals in</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.260" end="01:01:03.420" style="s2">your car and take good guesses of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.730" end="01:01:06.210" style="s2">they might be but we are on a mission to</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.240" end="01:01:19.560" style="s2">here and it&#39;s hidden in some other bus</p>

<p begin="01:02:59.900" end="01:03:03.350" style="s2">they yeah the bbc&#39;s that you create in</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.090" end="01:03:48.800" style="s2">replace the Neo well the Panda can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.860" end="01:03:50.390" style="s2">replace the Neo um the Neo is a hardware</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.800" end="01:03:52.700" style="s2">that runs our self-driving software but</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.390" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">there is a board inside of the Neo and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.700" end="01:04:02.540" style="s2">yeah I mean you can already replace that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:04:04.250" style="s2">board with a panda we have this board</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.540" end="01:04:07.130" style="s2">called the giant panda it&#39;s in the Neo</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.620" end="01:04:20.840" style="s2">succeeded but it took them almost 10</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.510" end="01:04:22.760" style="s2">years and that&#39;s Apple do you really</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.840" end="01:04:28.160" style="s2">think there&#39;s any way the automakers can</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.760" end="01:04:29.690" style="s2">keep me out by the way you offer your</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.160" end="01:04:31.580" style="s2">the right to do this stuff - there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:04:40.940" end="01:04:49.820" style="s2">be at 600 by tomorrow morning I could</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.690" end="01:04:51.350" style="s2">see that I could see that yeah we take</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.820" end="01:04:54.280" style="s2">it would take them something in ten</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.350" end="01:04:56.990" style="s2">years if it&#39;s even sort of possible I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.280" end="01:04:59.540" style="s2">mean can you know a can message is only</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.990" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">eight bytes or this is think old can FD</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.540" end="01:05:07.880" style="s2">which can do more bytes but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a long way away - right</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.880" end="01:05:14.550" style="s2">pressing on the brakes where are we</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.040" end="01:05:16.380" style="s2">pressing on the brakes this one looks</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.550" end="01:05:24.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s changing but it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.380" end="01:05:28.290" style="s2">slowly this is something but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.600" end="01:05:30.740" style="s2">look like the brakes that signals kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.290" end="01:05:30.740" style="s2">of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:54.600" style="s2">ah this could be the signal watch</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.660" end="01:05:58.140" style="s2">so what this could be is kind of a no no</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.600" end="01:05:59.790" style="s2">no no no no this looks more like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.140" end="01:06:01.530" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with the suspension of</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.790" end="01:06:03.510" style="s2">the car maybe the tilt angle of the car</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.530" end="01:06:06.450" style="s2">right as you think about how the car is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.510" end="01:06:09.780" style="s2">gonna come tilt audio will help you log</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.450" end="01:06:12.030" style="s2">things uh yeah I mean it will probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.780" end="01:06:15.870" style="s2">will probably add that to neo and</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.030" end="01:06:18.510" style="s2">Scheffer at some point it&#39;ll be very</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.870" end="01:06:20.160" style="s2">much opt-in audio and front cameras are</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.510" end="01:06:25.650" style="s2">very sensitive stuff we&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.160" end="01:06:27.090" style="s2">log those by default but ya know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.650" end="01:06:28.350" style="s2">it would be a helpful tool to reverse</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.090" end="01:06:33.780" style="s2">engineer if you could record the audio</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.350" end="01:06:35.700" style="s2">as well 384 guys alright so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.780" end="01:06:42.150" style="s2">what this is either but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.700" end="01:06:44.870" style="s2">fascinating signals in this car probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.150" end="01:06:44.870" style="s2">not that one</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.550" end="01:06:54.440" style="s2">so maybe we&#39;ll just name this one tilt</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.900" end="01:06:54.440" style="s2"> maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.960" end="01:07:06.220" style="s2">cabana opensource uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.770" end="01:07:06.220" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:12.770" style="s2">maybe the land oh you mean like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:13.819" style="s2">derivative I shouldn&#39;t call this tilt</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.770" end="01:07:16.420" style="s2"> maybe I should call it something</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.819" end="01:07:16.420" style="s2">better than that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.010" end="01:07:21.650" style="s2">those things just seen all over the</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.660" end="01:07:28.579" style="s2">place too</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.650" end="01:07:32.410" style="s2">I mean they might be part of it maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.579" end="01:07:32.410" style="s2">this is just a super big signal</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.040" end="01:07:44.490" style="s2">does this work with 32-bit signals maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.890" end="01:07:46.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work with 32-bit signals okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.490" end="01:07:52.130" style="s2">all right well that&#39;s the list of bugs</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.080" end="01:08:01.619" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t call it till maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.130" end="01:08:03.660" style="s2">I&#39;ll call it just been that is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.619" end="01:08:10.230" style="s2">how you sell suspension that&#39;s why to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.660" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">a pooh-bah thanks google sauce pen oh it</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.230" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">is hazel suspension</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.469" end="01:08:22.910" style="s2">we not what we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.940" end="01:08:33.679" style="s2">spoons are active a halt</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.460" end="01:08:57.060" style="s2">okay look at this packet this packet</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.350" end="01:08:59.130" style="s2">starts to do stuff once the breaking</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.060" end="01:09:02.070" style="s2">starts so you see it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.130" end="01:09:03.840" style="s2">oh okay I think we&#39;re onto something</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.070" end="01:09:06.210" style="s2">notice how it&#39;s nothing glitches a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.840" end="01:09:09.060" style="s2">little there and then there we go now it</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.210" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">starts breaking okay and that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.060" end="01:09:19.650" style="s2">it&#39;s going down with the yeah dude is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:27.000" style="s2">this the one we found before let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.650" end="01:09:31.010" style="s2">that that&#39;s clearly signed so is that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.000" end="01:09:31.010" style="s2">that the brake actuation command</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.819" end="01:09:47.080" style="s2">so this makes sense breaking Forsman</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.700" end="01:09:50.470" style="s2">break is fairly linear with maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.080" end="01:09:50.470" style="s2">check out this one</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.969" end="01:10:01.660" style="s2">now imagine doing all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.760" end="01:10:05.270" style="s2">without cabana</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.660" end="01:10:07.010" style="s2">it was super tedious and annoying like</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.270" end="01:10:11.270" style="s2">every one of those things that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.010" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">now with a couple mouse clicks would</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.270" end="01:10:14.570" style="s2">take you know you&#39;d have to plot that in</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:15.500" style="s2">Python you&#39;d have to write Python code</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.570" end="01:10:19.130" style="s2">in a notebook</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.500" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">hello I&#39;m watching you you have to plot</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.130" end="01:10:22.370" style="s2">that in a notebook and it would take a</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:25.870" style="s2">lot of time all right so this definitely</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.370" end="01:10:25.870" style="s2">has to do with the breaks</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.959" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">I think this last thing here is some</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.329" end="01:10:41.849" style="s2">sort of checksum but I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:41.849" style="s2">how it works</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.670" end="01:10:54.110" style="s2">just call Jackson</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.840" end="01:10:56.090" style="s2">I know the Honda checksums work so one</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.110" end="01:10:58.460" style="s2">thing I actually like about this car</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.090" end="01:10:59.810" style="s2">less than the Honda is the Honda doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.460" end="01:11:01.760" style="s2">just have a check so it has a counter</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.810" end="01:11:03.020" style="s2">and counters are really cool to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.760" end="01:11:06.290" style="s2">sure that your interface is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.020" end="01:11:09.739" style="s2">replaying stale data um this car doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.290" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">look like it has that so you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.739" end="01:11:12.710" style="s2">actually go in here if you want like</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:14.119" style="s2">expand one message you can expand it you</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.710" end="01:11:15.889" style="s2">can see what the actual values of these</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.119" end="01:11:20.290" style="s2">are at anytime I can throw those on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.889" end="01:11:20.290" style="s2">plot real quick close that off at play</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.349" end="01:11:30.050" style="s2">okay so that definitely has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.290" end="01:11:31.730" style="s2">the brakes so the way these messages</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.050" end="01:11:36.230" style="s2">work is they usually come from one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.730" end="01:11:39.489" style="s2">the one of the modules of the car so</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.230" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance this is a great command</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.489" end="01:11:50.150" style="s2">and this is break actual ah</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:51.770" style="s2">so now let&#39;s zoom out and see if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.150" end="01:11:57.320" style="s2">any way that&#39;s correct because we should</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.770" end="01:12:02.239" style="s2">not see that wherever we know we see it</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.320" end="01:12:04.040" style="s2">here - it&#39;s very clean now wait again</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.239" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">this is where I was before</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.040" end="01:12:10.340" style="s2">how does this go up when the car</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:13.550" style="s2">accelerates oh I might be really dumb</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.340" end="01:12:17.540" style="s2">you know with this no but how come it</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.550" end="01:12:19.280" style="s2">totally drops out there this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.540" end="01:12:22.940" style="s2">almost looks like it could be like rpm</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.280" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">or something see what makes this car</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.940" end="01:12:25.550" style="s2">extra tricky is the fact that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.550" end="01:12:30.409" style="s2">I&#39;ve never reverse engineered a hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:33.440" style="s2">before so this has a gas motor and an</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.409" end="01:12:41.449" style="s2">electric motor I&#39;m doing doing different</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.440" end="01:12:44.349" style="s2">things let&#39;s see all right well those</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.449" end="01:12:48.969" style="s2">are not what we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.349" end="01:12:48.969" style="s2">387 let&#39;s get to 400 you guys</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.400" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">you know the hybrid nests of this car</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.469" end="01:13:02.360" style="s2">makes it kind of tricky get better about</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:04.850" style="s2">this you know maybe I just need to read</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.360" end="01:13:07.489" style="s2">up more on hybrids um you know what</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.850" end="01:13:08.989" style="s2">let&#39;s do a little reading um so one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.489" end="01:13:12.440" style="s2">the ways that I&#39;ve found to learn things</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.989" end="01:13:27.650" style="s2">about cars is you can go sign up on tech</p>

<p begin="01:13:31.530" end="01:13:35.070" style="s2">yeah maybe the best way to talk to me is</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.570" end="01:13:45.750" style="s2">on slack because I can actually look</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.070" end="01:13:49.940" style="s2">over at that at that monitor would this</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.750" end="01:13:54.330" style="s2">help you oh oh I forgot about this</p>

<p begin="01:13:54.330" end="01:13:59.460" style="s2">with the toyota prius</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.790" end="01:14:02.490" style="s2">ho-ho this is exciting all you slack</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.460" end="01:14:06.120" style="s2">bros you guys are great um alright</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.490" end="01:14:07.560" style="s2">alright we got somewhere to start let me</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.120" end="01:14:09.930" style="s2">just make this focus up here ok so we</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.560" end="01:14:16.120" style="s2">have this PDF communicating with the</p>

<p begin="01:14:27.080" end="01:14:37.080" style="s2">alright yeah so they&#39;re wrong this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.290" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">actually only a 500k bus you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.080" end="01:14:49.620" style="s2">there&#39;s also the Charlie Miller paper</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:51.380" style="s2">and we can learn stuff from they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.620" end="01:14:53.820" style="s2">telling me okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.380" end="01:14:55.890" style="s2">alright here we got some numbers so</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.820" end="01:14:59.490" style="s2">these numbers are supposed to correspond</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.890" end="01:15:01.320" style="s2">to these numbers here it doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.490" end="01:15:03.300" style="s2">look like we have the same signal so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.320" end="01:15:07.380" style="s2">looking for like the gas pedal position</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.300" end="01:15:10.920" style="s2">one or the steering one no no they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.380" end="01:15:13.320" style="s2">changed it this prius is too new it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.920" end="01:15:15.090" style="s2">too new so you see these IDs here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.320" end="01:15:17.100" style="s2">searching for them in the data and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.090" end="01:15:21.690" style="s2">ID by the way is that like number next</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.100" end="01:15:23.330" style="s2">to the zero it&#39;s - no it&#39;s - do you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.690" end="01:15:29.570" style="s2">what you know where I have a resource</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.330" end="01:15:29.570" style="s2">I&#39;m coming I Bounty&#39;s see this one</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.500" end="01:15:40.840" style="s2">here we go speedometer toyou don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.770" end="01:15:42.550" style="s2">if this one matches up today so I put</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.840" end="01:15:44.200" style="s2">pages but they don&#39;t actually put the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.550" end="01:15:48.580" style="s2">page number so by the way yeah these</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.200" end="01:15:50.040" style="s2">graphics were taken from this Toyota T</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.580" end="01:15:58.270" style="s2">is thing okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.040" end="01:15:59.739" style="s2">so this breaking what&#39;s fine me let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.270" end="01:16:03.010" style="s2">start with the easy ones like if the</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.739" end="01:16:05.380" style="s2">speed doesn&#39;t match up then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.010" end="01:16:08.469" style="s2">gonna be here speedometer Toyota is on</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.380" end="01:16:12.250" style="s2">zero B for now I don&#39;t have a zero B for</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.469" end="01:16:15.610" style="s2">oh yes I do I do have a zero before all</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.250" end="01:16:20.380" style="s2">this look sightings okay so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.610" end="01:16:22.090" style="s2">claiming that the first they&#39;re claiming</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.380" end="01:16:25.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna oh this is really</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.090" end="01:16:28.260" style="s2">exciting I think this matches right so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.270" end="01:16:28.260" style="s2">just move this over a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.239" end="01:16:46.040" style="s2">knows what I want okay so if this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.680" end="01:16:46.040" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.550" end="01:16:59.869" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna put this you can see let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.750" end="01:17:01.369" style="s2">put it over here you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.869" end="01:17:03.050" style="s2">about your fur before using they tell</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.369" end="01:17:05.480" style="s2">you question it&#39;s okay so these look</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.050" end="01:17:08.030" style="s2">like they&#39;re all zeros that&#39;s true this</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.480" end="01:17:10.670" style="s2">is a counter according to the chart</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.030" end="01:17:15.889" style="s2">another thing so yeah look it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.670" end="01:17:18.380" style="s2">counter now it doesn&#39;t look like it</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.889" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">iterates constantly looks like it</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.380" end="01:17:21.650" style="s2">aerates based on speed okay it looks</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:26.510" style="s2">like they didn&#39;t maybe do the best job</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.650" end="01:17:28.730" style="s2">of reverse engineering themselves but it</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.510" end="01:17:32.030" style="s2">I mean it is a counter maybe it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.730" end="01:17:34.179" style="s2">that&#39;s like the odometer itself right so</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.030" end="01:17:37.489" style="s2">let&#39;s not call it counter let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.179" end="01:17:40.280" style="s2">odometer or maybe maybe the better word</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.489" end="01:17:45.320" style="s2">is even encoder you know just like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.280" end="01:17:47.540" style="s2">like a shaft encoder this one I agree</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.320" end="01:17:49.310" style="s2">with them that it&#39;s the checksum oh now</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.540" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">we&#39;re finally breaking some stuff open</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.310" end="01:17:53.510" style="s2">so yeah just search for it&#39;s actually on</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:55.040" style="s2">our Bounty&#39;s page if you want to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.510" end="01:17:58.940" style="s2">access to this resource as well will I</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.040" end="01:18:00.530" style="s2">do this so yeah it&#39;s an encoder and it</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.940" end="01:18:02.449" style="s2">depends on your speed like that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.530" end="01:18:04.520" style="s2">depends how what like the slope of these</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.449" end="01:18:10.909" style="s2">lines alright so they&#39;re claiming that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.520" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">this is the speed that&#39;s true and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.909" end="01:18:14.540" style="s2">they talk also about where the speed</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:16.790" style="s2">comes from yes that&#39;s the speed look how</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.540" end="01:18:18.199" style="s2">well it matches up okay we are getting</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.790" end="01:18:20.030" style="s2">somewhere this is very exciting you guys</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.199" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">this is the most exciting part of this</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.030" end="01:18:25.699" style="s2">periscope yeah this will even be more</p>

<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:26.950" style="s2">steering packets oh yes okay I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.950" end="01:21:29.150" style="s2">this is how we control steering nearing</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.950" end="01:21:29.720" style="s2">control oh okay you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.150" end="01:21:32.840" style="s2">gonna do</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.420" end="01:21:52.060" style="s2">let&#39;s scroll over to that next that out</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:52.060" style="s2">oh this is this is this is very exciting</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.220" end="01:22:02.320" style="s2">oh look what&#39;s happening again look it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:22:32.050" end="01:22:41.270" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s plot this what are</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.659" end="01:22:45.230" style="s2">they claiming these things are flag and</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.270" end="01:22:47.210" style="s2">angle nature well yeah they have they</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.230" end="01:22:52.040" style="s2">have like a weird biting coating of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.210" end="01:22:58.369" style="s2">stuff in terms of nipple and minor angle</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.040" end="01:23:01.190" style="s2">so actually what this should be is we</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.369" end="01:23:07.699" style="s2">can actually remove this signal they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.190" end="01:23:10.760" style="s2">saying this is the angle so this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.699" end="01:23:12.860" style="s2">where the self-parking here happens it</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.760" end="01:23:18.460" style="s2">looks like that fog is rearing its head</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.860" end="01:23:18.460" style="s2">again with some multiple in the graph</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.250" end="01:23:26.349" style="s2">393 let&#39;s keep it going let&#39;s keep it</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.650" end="01:23:29.090" style="s2">going okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.349" end="01:23:30.710" style="s2">let&#39;s scroll back to here hopefully the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.090" end="01:23:32.889" style="s2">bug will go away and we can test it over</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.710" end="01:23:32.889" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.070" end="01:23:56.190" style="s2">alright let&#39;s save this DBC to github</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.470" end="01:23:59.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna refresh this page and</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.190" end="01:24:09.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna look seriously into why this</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.730" end="01:24:11.520" style="s2">keeps happening you don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.600" end="01:24:13.530" style="s2">to save the DBC if you refresh it and go</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.520" end="01:24:23.280" style="s2">away it&#39;s saved in local storage web</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.530" end="01:24:25.520" style="s2">browser I have a signals all over the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.280" end="01:24:25.520" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.740" end="01:24:33.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t really think they have it right</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.240" end="01:24:55.560" style="s2">it might have something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.520" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">steering but seven more and you could</p>

<p begin="01:24:58.920" end="01:25:09.390" style="s2">right now so okay that is when I turn</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.560" end="01:25:11.040" style="s2">the wheel so it&#39;s certainly related to</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.390" end="01:25:13.400" style="s2">the steering angle but I think that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.040" end="01:25:19.350" style="s2">went too far I think maybe it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.400" end="01:25:27.540" style="s2">maybe not that all right it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.350" end="01:25:29.130" style="s2">one there oh no I&#39;m dumb I&#39;m dumb look</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.540" end="01:25:32.370" style="s2">at what I&#39;m doing guys so you see how</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.130" end="01:25:35.400" style="s2">this is a and a n that&#39;s actually only</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.370" end="01:25:36.930" style="s2">twelve bits I was looking at 24 bits so</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.400" end="01:25:44.790" style="s2">that&#39;s in the wrong place there right</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.930" end="01:25:47.040" style="s2">I&#39;m wrong remove its dude okay this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.790" end="01:25:48.600" style="s2">our auto endianness detectives just go</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.040" end="01:25:51.500" style="s2">in there like that go in there like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.600" end="01:25:54.510" style="s2">go in there like that oh this is fun</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.500" end="01:25:59.240" style="s2">what I love and things just work okay so</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.510" end="01:26:01.620" style="s2">that is a flag and that says whether the</p>

<p begin="01:26:13.350" end="01:26:18.930" style="s2">and then we want this to be a signed</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.050" end="01:26:20.800" style="s2">thing because there&#39;s a better side</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.930" end="01:26:24.700" style="s2">because you can turn this chair a little</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.800" end="01:26:26.950" style="s2">both ways all right oh that&#39;s a clean</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.700" end="01:26:29.500" style="s2">signal take a look at that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.950" end="01:26:30.760" style="s2">gonna be a steering to the left and this</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.500" end="01:26:34.239" style="s2">is gonna be a steering to the right I</p>

<p begin="01:28:38.980" end="01:28:43.210" style="s2">with this reverse engineering thank you</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.900" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">very much for helping us out in creating</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.210" end="01:28:46.000" style="s2">this DBC file and watch the cars about</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:48.310" style="s2">to park itself</p>

<p begin="01:28:52.300" end="01:28:57.790" style="s2">the brake packet but I did with some</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.690" end="01:29:01.000" style="s2">great help find the steering control</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.790" end="01:29:04.450" style="s2">packet and can i should&#39;a plan to</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.000" end="01:29:07.120" style="s2">purchase now hey what if I had it no</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.450" end="01:29:08.650" style="s2">these are low tier pcs I mean some of</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.120" end="01:29:10.930" style="s2">them are some of them are right but like</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.650" end="01:29:13.510" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t want you want people</p>

<p begin="01:29:13.510" end="01:29:17.350" style="s2">is why I always talk about ICO stuff you</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.000" end="01:29:19.780" style="s2">know who&#39;s gonna add more value to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.350" end="01:29:22.660" style="s2">crowd I think it&#39;s really aligned with</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.780" end="01:29:24.460" style="s2">value creation more so than the</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.660" end="01:29:27.760" style="s2">traditional VC model which maybe makes a</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.460" end="01:29:29.890" style="s2">few people rich we do crowd make a lot</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.760" end="01:29:31.600" style="s2">of people rich well don&#39;t apply to shark</p>

<p begin="01:29:45.130" end="01:29:49.050" style="s2">think even below that there&#39;s our shark</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.840" end="01:29:49.050" style="s2">tank</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.709" end="01:30:00.050" style="s2">oh yeah so look at this look at this</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.289" end="01:30:01.880" style="s2">this is as the wheel turn so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.050" end="01:30:04.150" style="s2">steering control packet this thing is</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.880" end="01:30:04.150" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.619" end="01:30:13.369" style="s2">although the smoke right so according to</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.150" end="01:30:15.079" style="s2">this documentation although the servo</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.369" end="01:30:16.760" style="s2">packet has been reversed the car still</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.079" end="01:30:24.619" style="s2">requires the current year to be reverse</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.760" end="01:30:30.019" style="s2">oh oh oh this is the current year can I</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.619" end="01:30:31.880" style="s2">do okay cool cool oh man these people</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.019" end="01:30:34.820" style="s2">are great okay so that&#39;s what I called</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.880" end="01:30:41.030" style="s2">suspension maybe shows you how much I</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.820" end="01:30:43.389" style="s2">know okay it&#39;s it&#39;s car movement kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.030" end="01:30:43.389" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.210" end="01:31:00.040" style="s2">data v1v variably used to designate</p>

<p begin="01:31:00.040" end="01:31:11.730" style="s2">is car movement gr is gear and counter</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.840" end="01:31:11.730" style="s2">okay so I&#39;m wrong that&#39;s not a signal</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.620" end="01:31:19.620" style="s2">396</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.300" end="01:31:30.280" style="s2">the state of petals let&#39;s let&#39;s plot</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.030" end="01:31:35.580" style="s2">that PE thing car moving it&#39;s that here</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.280" end="01:31:35.580" style="s2">it&#39;s an 8-bit signal and it&#39;s signed lot</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.000" end="01:31:42.240" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.200" end="01:31:52.250" style="s2">car movement okay so this is car moving</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.780" end="01:31:57.960" style="s2">forward and this is braking or reverse</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.250" end="01:32:03.780" style="s2">no I guess that&#39;s breaking okay so they</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.960" end="01:32:06.000" style="s2">call this car move I&#39;m gonna stop</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.780" end="01:32:08.220" style="s2">calling it suspension we&#39;re gonna call</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.000" end="01:32:10.190" style="s2">it is usually like maybe the body</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.220" end="01:32:13.190" style="s2">packets of the car I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.190" end="01:32:13.190" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.220" end="01:32:16.299" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.749" end="01:32:30.170" style="s2">so that&#39;s the car movement and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.619" end="01:32:37.219" style="s2">these next things are the gear encounter</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.170" end="01:32:45.849" style="s2">so this is the gear the car is in this</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.219" end="01:32:48.139" style="s2">is counter and this here is the checksum</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.849" end="01:32:51.369" style="s2">sure figure I can keep these checks up</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.139" end="01:32:51.369" style="s2">soon or start sending these messages</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.789" end="01:33:07.820" style="s2">alright so you can see that yeah so they</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.409" end="01:33:09.530" style="s2">say three is drive and one is reverse so</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.820" end="01:33:11.090" style="s2">we should actually you can set that kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.530" end="01:33:13.179" style="s2">of stuff at DBC and then one is park so</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.090" end="01:33:17.269" style="s2">you can see that I&#39;m in drive here</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.179" end="01:33:18.559" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna need to plot maybe that no</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.269" end="01:33:20.059" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna put that let&#39;s just pluck</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.559" end="01:33:22.670" style="s2">our movement all right so you can see</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.059" end="01:33:24.019" style="s2">that I go into reverse here back and</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.670" end="01:33:26.949" style="s2">drive for a little bit here and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.019" end="01:33:29.749" style="s2">with Carson Park right look at this</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.949" end="01:33:32.809" style="s2">license to car manufactures license the</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.749" end="01:33:34.670" style="s2">car manufacturers is a scam hey maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.809" end="01:33:36.050" style="s2">someday I don&#39;t want to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.670" end="01:33:37.190" style="s2">really is like a license deal I want to</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.050" end="01:33:39.499" style="s2">think about it more like Sirius</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.190" end="01:33:41.749" style="s2">satellite radio they include the</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.499" end="01:33:45.440" style="s2">hardware with their car and will provide</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.749" end="01:33:47.749" style="s2">the software the software is free</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.440" end="01:33:50.360" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s offers a service so you you</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.749" end="01:33:51.769" style="s2">know install the software and then open</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.360" end="01:33:55.280" style="s2">pilot has a monthly subscription fee</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.769" end="01:34:00.019" style="s2">once it gets really good so we can label</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.280" end="01:34:01.249" style="s2">this one here too this thing counts when</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.019" end="01:34:02.869" style="s2">moving that doesn&#39;t even really seem</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.249" end="01:34:06.860" style="s2">like a useful signal I&#39;m not even a</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.869" end="01:34:08.900" style="s2">label Ellen oh this is exciting</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.860" end="01:34:10.639" style="s2">let&#39;s save our newly found information</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.900" end="01:34:13.070" style="s2">to my github so by the way this is going</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.639" end="01:34:15.880" style="s2">live right now on my github if you go to</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.070" end="01:34:15.880" style="s2">github geo hot</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.290" end="01:34:25.750" style="s2">you think I have too many embarrassing</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.430" end="01:34:27.180" style="s2">private repos they do but yeah you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.750" end="01:34:29.710" style="s2">see that this is going right now to</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.180" end="01:34:34.120" style="s2">Toyota Prius with the open D BC updates</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.710" end="01:34:35.590" style="s2">there you can see the pull requests that</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.120" end="01:34:37.090" style="s2">are automatically being created when I</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.590" end="01:34:40.360" style="s2">click pull to github and you can see</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.090" end="01:34:44.310" style="s2">that this is that a gear package that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.360" end="01:34:50.260" style="s2">just reverse engineered in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.310" end="01:34:54.640" style="s2">DBC file form so it&#39;s pretty cool sweet</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.260" end="01:34:57.910" style="s2">let&#39;s see what else we have there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.640" end="01:35:03.870" style="s2">another speed packet okay so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.910" end="01:35:03.870" style="s2">packet responsible for reporting speed</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.530" end="01:35:12.250" style="s2">to the system and that does the steering</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.930" end="01:35:15.490" style="s2">lock out I already have that one figured</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.250" end="01:35:19.090" style="s2">out I just gonna call it speed guess</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.490" end="01:35:20.790" style="s2">they already posted it in their paper so</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.090" end="01:35:23.500" style="s2">yeah you see that the speed is not</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.790" end="01:35:24.880" style="s2">forward or negative it&#39;s not positive or</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.500" end="01:35:26.770" style="s2">negative it just go negative in Reverse</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.880" end="01:35:28.840" style="s2">because of how the wheel encoders work</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.770" end="01:35:35.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not quadrature colors they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.840" end="01:35:37.300" style="s2">just normal encoders 398 folks 398 ok so</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.890" end="01:35:39.840" style="s2">then they talk about what packets they</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.300" end="01:35:42.160" style="s2">said oh then there&#39;s also an LK a packet</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.840" end="01:35:50.830" style="s2">exciting exciting I don&#39;t so you can get</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.160" end="01:35:53.800" style="s2">that one this is the steering LK a and</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.830" end="01:35:56.620" style="s2">then let&#39;s rename the other one oops</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.800" end="01:35:59.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t want an X naught to be steering</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.620" end="01:36:03.810" style="s2">control but we&#39;ll call this one steering</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.880" end="01:36:06.010" style="s2">intelligent Park Assist system wall</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.810" end="01:36:07.450" style="s2">alright so let&#39;s do this one quickly see</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.010" end="01:36:09.880" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a lane five packet I</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.450" end="01:36:18.410" style="s2">think should tell us that this guy here</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.880" end="01:36:20.120" style="s2">is a counter major angle</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.410" end="01:36:23.840" style="s2">carry over I don&#39;t know why they</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.120" end="01:36:25.700" style="s2">describe it like this just talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.840" end="01:36:31.370" style="s2">like the way DBC is talking about it but</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.700" end="01:36:39.640" style="s2">that&#39;s an angle this is called LK a</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.370" end="01:36:39.640" style="s2">state and this is a check something</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.550" end="01:36:49.130" style="s2">alright yeah we&#39;re going to move away</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.240" end="01:36:51.110" style="s2">from this because that&#39;s the intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.130" end="01:36:55.100" style="s2">Park Assist stuff let&#39;s see if we can</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.110" end="01:36:57.850" style="s2">find where I actually use the lane keep</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.100" end="01:36:57.850" style="s2">assist system</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.510" end="01:37:15.510" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s plot the angle right here oh</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.010" end="01:37:16.950" style="s2">oh look right there look right there it</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.510" end="01:37:19.410" style="s2">does something all right now of course</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.950" end="01:37:24.810" style="s2">it&#39;s signed so we&#39;re gonna have to go in</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.410" end="01:37:28.320" style="s2">here and change that to signed yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.810" end="01:37:30.030" style="s2">all right the bug is back but either way</p>
