<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:16.459" style="s2">will get this out of the way right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.769" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">it&#39;s $24 a month so you know $24 a month</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.459" end="00:04:18.889" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">some old TechCrunch Disrupt Tom had</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.889" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">always been talking about how it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:25.669" style="s2">be $24 a month well guess what now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:27.350" style="s2">$24 a month um so you can buy it in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.669" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">App comic connect but we&#39;ll get to all</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.350" end="00:04:31.880" style="s2">that in a minute we&#39;re gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">the next perk that you get now this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.880" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">kind of the bad one so remember when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">promised unlimited cloud storage well</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:40.780" style="s2">that was all alive because it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">that cloud storage is really expensive</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.780" end="00:04:45.620" style="s2">we had free cloud dollars for a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">but the free cloud dollars are running</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:51.760" style="s2">out so the perks that we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">pass on to you are running out too but</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.760" end="00:04:55.220" style="s2">basically what this means is you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">you can access all your drives and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.220" end="00:04:59.960" style="s2">Explorer in the app and in Cabana if you</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.220" end="00:05:21.229" style="s2">privacy bro-bro privacy is dead</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.580" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">what we&#39;ll get to privacy actually we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.229" end="00:05:25.789" style="s2">have for the next part is pretty private</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">I like to think that like read privacy</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.789" end="00:05:32.690" style="s2">is dead but write privacy can still</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:34.250" style="s2">definitely exist um so we we these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.690" end="00:05:36.740" style="s2">expected things these are expected you</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:28.869" style="s2">okay the next thing is the SSH gateway</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.819" end="00:06:30.669" style="s2">so this one I&#39;m gonna show you a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.869" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">bit one of the first things we built at</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.669" end="00:06:37.149" style="s2">kama was a VPN if you own an eon we</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:39.939" style="s2">should get a free sim if we sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.149" end="00:06:42.129" style="s2">kama prime so the sims are $20 if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.939" end="00:06:45.339" style="s2">already own an eon if you&#39;re buying eon</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.129" end="00:06:46.959" style="s2">today or later you get a free sim but</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.339" end="00:06:48.459" style="s2">what I think I&#39;m gonna mail you guys all</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.959" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">sims you think I&#39;m really gonna do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.459" end="00:06:51.490" style="s2">and then me with a little envelope</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:53.499" style="s2">sitting there forever no no no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.490" end="00:06:55.479" style="s2">not ssh with 22:4 right because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.499" end="00:06:56.979" style="s2">not gonna open we&#39;re not going to expose</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.479" end="00:06:58.119" style="s2">that ssh to the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.979" end="00:07:00.550" style="s2">um you can&#39;t really do that right</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.119" end="00:07:03.879" style="s2">because you&#39;re behind that&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.550" end="00:07:06.369" style="s2">built is an SSH gateway it&#39;s not a VPN</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.879" end="00:07:08.379" style="s2">um so to be clear what the differences</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.369" end="00:07:10.569" style="s2">are we don&#39;t like like unlike some other</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.379" end="00:07:12.219" style="s2">companies that put all the cars on a VPN</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.569" end="00:07:13.869" style="s2">I think they&#39;ve moved away from that now</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.219" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">but you kind of don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.869" end="00:07:17.979" style="s2">right because then all the phones are on</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:19.809" style="s2">the same VPN so you don&#39;t want to do</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.740" end="00:08:25.269" style="s2">so our security model is the same as SSH</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.599" end="00:08:27.339" style="s2">meaning basically all its real all our</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.269" end="00:08:32.110" style="s2">back-end is really doing is exposing the</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">set it up so this is the command we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">some scripts to make it easier but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:55.779" style="s2">you want you can just do this this is</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.089" end="00:09:35.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not Arch Linux Ubuntu servers high</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.860" end="00:09:37.510" style="s2">quality um what this does is gives you</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.510" end="00:09:40.990" style="s2">in the world so if you&#39;re a comma Prime</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.130" end="00:09:42.370" style="s2">member you can just set up a script on</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.320" end="00:09:52.779" style="s2">lot of features in the coming months</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.390" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">that use like this live integration with</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.779" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">the car</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.410" end="00:09:56.980" style="s2">say something hypothetically we could</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:58.630" style="s2">roll out is like door unlock from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.980" end="00:10:00.040" style="s2">app or something like that right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.630" end="00:10:02.110" style="s2">know if that&#39;s actually gonna happen but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:03.790" style="s2">you could theoretically build features</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.110" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">like that for now we&#39;re giving you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.790" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">are our tools still really are developer</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:09.130" style="s2">tools so we&#39;re giving developers access</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:12.459" style="s2">remote start yeah SSH right you see not</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.130" end="00:10:14.020" style="s2">now you guys are thinking of course you</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:21.190" style="s2">access to know the EON is never offline</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.270" end="00:10:22.449" style="s2">for power saving the EON is always</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.190" end="00:10:25.570" style="s2">connected to the cell phone network just</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.449" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">like a normal cell phone right but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.570" end="00:10:28.930" style="s2">of the power saving stuff had nothing to</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.230" end="00:35:06.370" style="s2">aggressive as well I think I think when</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.050" end="00:35:10.030" style="s2">you do the math it&#39;s somewhere in like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.370" end="00:35:12.820" style="s2">the thirty gigabyte range let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.030" end="00:35:15.490" style="s2">let me do the math out sorry I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.820" end="00:35:17.500" style="s2">sorry I can&#39;t show you this dream this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.490" end="00:35:19.420" style="s2">screen but I just don&#39;t have a good way</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:23.110" style="s2">to do it but okay so it&#39;s 512 kilobits</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.420" end="00:35:25.540" style="s2">per second times 60 that&#39;s per minute</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.110" end="00:35:29.110" style="s2">times 60 knots per hour times 24 times</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.540" end="00:35:31.330" style="s2">30 and that is of course kilobits not</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.110" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">kill a byte so we&#39;re gonna divide that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.330" end="00:35:40.170" style="s2">by a illness they kill a bit yellow by</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:40.170" style="s2">doing data bytes</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.260" end="00:35:54.930" style="s2">so if I did the math right it&#39;s that all</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.920" end="00:35:59.320" style="s2">right so it&#39;s it&#39;s 512 kilobyte 60</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.930" end="00:36:02.380" style="s2">minutes 60 60 seconds per minute 60</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.320" end="00:36:04.900" style="s2">minutes per hour 24 hours per day 30</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.380" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">days per month divided by 8 because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.900" end="00:36:09.940" style="s2">bytes not pets kilobytes equals hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.260" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">twenty hundred thirty sixty five</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.940" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">gigabytes so that&#39;s theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:18.670" style="s2">possible but you get you get less than</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:19.950" style="s2">that right but like really you don&#39;t</p>
