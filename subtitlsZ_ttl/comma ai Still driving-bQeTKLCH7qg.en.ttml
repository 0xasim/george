<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.350" style="s2">working so maybe that&#39;s something to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:52.030" style="s2">with the interaction with no more oh no</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.940" end="00:46:51.320" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna pull us back so unlike a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.400" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">lot of other systems our system doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:56.420" style="s2">wheel it&#39;s kind of like a Lane Keeping</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.830" end="00:46:57.740" style="s2">Assist system early is a Lane Keeping</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.420" end="00:46:58.250" style="s2">Assist I was the poor boy oh my camera</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.250" end="00:47:03.470" style="s2">don&#39;t let me forget we don&#39;t disengage</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.370" end="00:47:05.210" style="s2">when you touch the wheel but we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.470" end="00:47:07.670" style="s2">disengage when you hit the gas and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.210" end="00:47:09.650" style="s2">surprised more systems don&#39;t if cars are</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.670" end="00:47:11.450" style="s2">breaking when you don&#39;t want them to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.650" end="00:47:13.790" style="s2">natural human response is to hit the gas</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.450" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">so we disengage on gas</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.790" end="00:47:19.420" style="s2">we don&#39;t disengage on steering so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:23.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t we still call it like a disengage</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.420" end="00:47:24.920" style="s2">from a like when we track this stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.600" end="00:47:26.600" style="s2">the back end but it&#39;s not like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.920" end="00:47:28.420" style="s2">actually like disengage the system it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.600" end="00:47:30.309" style="s2">kept doing the gas in the brake</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.420" end="00:47:35.130" style="s2">more than one camera this guy&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.309" end="00:47:35.130" style="s2">slow hang on just change lanes here</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.050" end="00:47:41.700" style="s2">yeah most of hard loggin so first off</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.550" end="00:47:43.530" style="s2">let me into the monitor so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.700" end="00:47:45.150" style="s2">roll out before you see more than what</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.530" end="00:47:48.750" style="s2">camera is we&#39;re gonna roll out a fisheye</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">lens for an existing smart - lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.750" end="00:47:57.170" style="s2">times when you want from our cameras is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:57.170" style="s2">just look scared scared</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.940" end="00:48:05.810" style="s2">a lot of times will you walk from</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.620" end="00:48:05.810" style="s2">multiple cameras yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.859" style="s2">just Tom or view with the road</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.900" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">and efficient I will get you there</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.910" end="00:48:17.060" style="s2">using a single camera is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:18.170" style="s2">guaranteed synchronization right if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.060" end="00:48:19.640" style="s2">have multiple cameras you got to deal</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.170" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">with synchronizing them you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.640" end="00:48:22.910" style="s2">calibrating it with respect to each</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.560" style="s2">other things are just now since all</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.910" end="00:48:26.990" style="s2">right here we go for a French here move</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.560" end="00:48:29.300" style="s2">I&#39;m lowering the speed manually but</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.990" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">Oakland pilots gonna take this turn this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.300" end="00:48:33.470" style="s2">is all open fire I&#39;m sorry Lord the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:36.140" style="s2">speed I lowered the cruise control speed</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.470" end="00:48:38.090" style="s2">down to 55 to take this turn it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.140" end="00:48:41.800" style="s2">accelerate on turns but I was going</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.090" end="00:48:44.090" style="s2">faster than I&#39;d like to say on the video</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:45.640" style="s2">so you know this is gonna be tricky</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.090" end="00:48:49.070" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can do this all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.640" end="00:48:50.780" style="s2">take a look what&#39;s coming up no liner is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.070" end="00:48:52.670" style="s2">not critical that his fake news put out</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.780" end="00:48:55.820" style="s2">by the lidar people I&#39;m actually putting</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.670" end="00:48:59.210" style="s2">the speed up here I just let the speed</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.820" end="00:49:01.250" style="s2">back up to 69 and if this was all done</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.210" end="00:49:03.740" style="s2">by open-plan to do is press the cruise</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.250" end="00:49:07.270" style="s2">control buttons I&#39;m gonna do the lane</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.740" end="00:49:07.270" style="s2">change to the left right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.839" end="00:49:17.130" style="s2">no letters joke is enter coming back</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.060" end="00:49:19.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to ask yeah yeah so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.130" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">function of speed as well if you ever</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.170" end="00:49:22.950" style="s2">have like it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:29.480" style="s2">this car has a slightly up stork from</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.950" end="00:49:29.480" style="s2">stop see this one can do a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.070" end="00:49:37.310" style="s2">yes my camera we&#39;re mostly interested in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:38.600" style="s2">a fisheye and side radars and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.310" end="00:49:41.180" style="s2">can provide a lot of autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.600" end="00:49:41.780" style="s2">functionalities and multiple cameras</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.180" end="00:49:45.890" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.780" end="00:49:47.930" style="s2">might just be a it again use some edge</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.890" end="00:49:51.050" style="s2">cases but a lot of your cases to be just</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.380" end="00:50:00.230" style="s2">the Honda CRV is probably the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.210" end="00:50:06.460" style="s2">one to war to 2016 CRV has the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.230" end="00:50:06.460" style="s2">connector as the Civic the 2017 CRV</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.990" end="00:50:10.760" style="s2">has a different connector but it still</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.630" end="00:50:14.810" style="s2">has the stuff you&#39;re gonna need on it</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.760" end="00:50:17.880" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I would say that&#39;s easiest</p>
