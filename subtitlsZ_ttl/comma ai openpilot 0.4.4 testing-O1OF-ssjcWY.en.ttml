<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:18.529" style="s2">calibrate</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.760" end="00:00:30.640" style="s2">so y&#39;all know the craziest thing about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.980" end="00:00:32.140" style="s2">0.3 0.4 0.4 your yawn and I can&#39;t show</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.140" end="00:00:37.030" style="s2">specially modified but your yawn we</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.329" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">flipped upside down so if you unscrew</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.030" end="00:00:39.970" style="s2">the screws from the top and unscrew the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:43.989" style="s2">screws on the bottom you can switch the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.970" end="00:00:45.250" style="s2">position of the two places you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.989" end="00:00:50.379" style="s2">switch the position of the two places</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.250" end="00:00:52.930" style="s2">and then you can uh speaking of bums we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.379" end="00:00:58.870" style="s2">got more right here we&#39;re gonna cruise</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.930" end="00:01:00.190" style="s2">past it yep boom yeah so I got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.870" end="00:01:02.170" style="s2">calibrate so that means I got a drive</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.190" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">above 45 miles an hour it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.170" end="00:01:08.710" style="s2">like speed here unfortunately the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:10.420" style="s2">version will not zero point four point</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.710" end="00:01:13.030" style="s2">four will not be shipping with the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.420" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">calibration I mean you can blame the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.030" end="00:01:17.350" style="s2">calibration team for that and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:19.149" style="s2">blame anybody there&#39;s no blame everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.350" end="00:01:24.009" style="s2">loves everybody because it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.149" end="00:01:25.630" style="s2">world but what&#39;s important is zero point</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.009" end="00:01:27.429" style="s2">four point four we&#39;ll have some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.630" end="00:01:28.869" style="s2">best stuff and one of the fate my</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.429" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">favorite feature is zero point four</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.869" end="00:01:33.459" style="s2">point four is I&#39;m being recorded right</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:35.890" style="s2">now by the front camera mom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.459" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">optional you can turn it on or off your</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.890" end="00:01:39.099" style="s2">yawns also upside down which allows the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:40.750" style="s2">front camera to see the driver much</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.099" end="00:01:42.910" style="s2">better it kind of just makes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.750" end="00:01:45.009" style="s2">experience just kind of makes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.910" end="00:01:46.630" style="s2">experience better so I can&#39;t engage yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.009" end="00:01:47.739" style="s2">because calibration is not finished so</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.630" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go on the highway and hope</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.739" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">it calibrates</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.260" end="00:02:00.170" style="s2">but yeah we can uh we can take questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.430" end="00:02:09.020" style="s2">any any questions for this this dopey</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.150" end="00:08:24.249" style="s2">no no guys because everything takes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.490" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">long-ass time you know has it been a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.249" end="00:08:27.939" style="s2">long-ass time since we did mapping</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.529" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">it is calibrating one person Wow</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.659" end="00:08:36.430" style="s2">calibration sucks I&#39;m gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:41.620" style="s2">drive all the way to Mountain View for</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.430" end="00:08:43.570" style="s2">this thing to calibrate oh it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.620" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">exciting though Oh 2% I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:48.420" style="s2">calibrated an open pilot and so long</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.430" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">this is a new device Oh free the DSP Sh</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.420" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">well I mean you know maybe it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.500" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2">favored you free the DSP maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:57.070" style="s2">free the DSP how does the model predict</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.610" end="00:08:57.790" style="s2">the road Oh how does it do that I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:00.190" style="s2">the maps</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.790" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">none of that stuff shipping it works but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.190" end="00:09:05.149" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t think of the shaft yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:07.009" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.149" end="00:09:10.089" style="s2">everything takes forever it just takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.009" end="00:09:10.089" style="s2">forever to build anything guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:17.990" style="s2">oh man this is terrible you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:21.840" style="s2">me I have to drive while it calibrates</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.990" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">these brutal calibration shouldn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.840" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">so long it takes so long uh uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:29.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna say anything bad you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.240" end="00:09:32.070" style="s2">it&#39;s just it was written a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.750" end="00:09:33.960" style="s2">before we understood everything about</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.070" end="00:09:39.270" style="s2">computer vision before we all got PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.960" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">in computer vision we have much better</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.270" end="00:09:43.590" style="s2">calibration but it&#39;s only internal but</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">it will ship soon got a ship it got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.590" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">ship you get put on the device and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:51.500" style="s2">gonna be used the DSP for that well</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:56.670" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna ship something called orb D</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.500" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">or &#39;buddy is gonna compute great orb</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.670" end="00:10:04.130" style="s2">features right there on your DSP only at</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:04.130" style="s2">11% this is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.029" end="00:10:11.209" style="s2">it looks calibrated - sorry guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:13.069" style="s2">user-experience got to get better yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.209" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">for diffusion on nobody&#39;s done shit</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.069" end="00:10:17.389" style="s2">how&#39;d y&#39;all get the DSP I used to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:19.850" style="s2">when I was 22 I was probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.389" end="00:10:26.449" style="s2">hacker alive I&#39;m not anymore but you</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the calibration for it figures</p>
