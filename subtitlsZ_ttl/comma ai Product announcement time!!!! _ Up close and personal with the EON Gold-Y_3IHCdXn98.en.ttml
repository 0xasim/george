<p begin="00:00:19.679" end="00:00:25.039" style="s2">to that and trigger a bad team commander</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.449" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">so basically the duh the end result of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">our solutions is we call that incidence</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">of the cybersecurity incidence probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">would be a little hard to read but you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">can see this is one example our product</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:45.230" style="s2">is used by something another trend ugly</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.890" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">scene Ottawa which is</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:59.660" style="s2">violation in this specific instance we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.610" end="00:01:01.879" style="s2">see a stop engine command that was sent</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.660" end="00:01:04.840" style="s2">to the fleet at a bad time at that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.879" end="00:01:07.550" style="s2">could be like as the people is driving</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.840" end="00:01:09.560" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to about an etic</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.550" end="00:01:11.690" style="s2">kill engine for me that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.560" end="00:01:15.229" style="s2">feature in some of the telematics</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.690" end="00:01:18.259" style="s2">providers have but it&#39;s only enabled in</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.229" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2">places like South America but in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.259" end="00:01:23.030" style="s2">u.s. it&#39;s not illegal to use that to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.750" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">that specific feature so they disable it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.030" end="00:01:30.229" style="s2">in to cover but what the hacker gets in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">and even if they weren&#39;t supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.229" end="00:01:35.890" style="s2">that something</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking to find together the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.890" end="00:01:43.299" style="s2">key idea is to find it you know not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:45.640" style="s2">after it already took place but like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.299" end="00:01:49.719" style="s2">after the horses that were born that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.640" end="00:01:52.420" style="s2">meant some ladies trying to play with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.719" end="00:01:55.719" style="s2">lot and we give like it&#39;s like an early</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.420" end="00:01:59.049" style="s2">detection facility where the Oleum tent</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.719" end="00:02:01.569" style="s2">work for those lead operators so Mike my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.049" end="00:02:04.780" style="s2">last slide pretty much this having said</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.569" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">all that security and I think anybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.780" end="00:02:10.030" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s been into space there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:12.519" style="s2">you know one solution that is assault</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.030" end="00:02:14.650" style="s2">everything it&#39;s like there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.519" end="00:02:18.190" style="s2">concept called defense in depth and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:21.160" style="s2">in this area we look at lead vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.190" end="00:02:23.910" style="s2">security is something that will find</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.160" end="00:02:26.019" style="s2">this way makes me to be equals over time</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.910" end="00:02:28.240" style="s2">definitely not today there&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.019" end="00:02:30.280" style="s2">think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.240" end="00:02:32.020" style="s2">Tesla they haven&#39;t publicized whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.280" end="00:02:34.390" style="s2">they have it they have liked it some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.020" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">elements of a people components but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.390" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s there&#39;s many others</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:40.630" style="s2">that have implemented that inside their</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:42.760" style="s2">cars it will be a part of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.630" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">solution over time but we see the place</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.760" end="00:02:47.800" style="s2">that most aliens are starting is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:50.620" style="s2">disliked about base where you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.800" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">actually have a level of detection which</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.620" end="00:02:58.240" style="s2">is what it&#39;s actually prescribed work</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:03:00.160" style="s2">for the automakers you can happen today</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.240" end="00:03:03.220" style="s2">if you have a basement data that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.160" end="00:03:05.770" style="s2">already collecting and this is the only</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.220" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">way to actually offer protection across</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.770" end="00:03:10.090" style="s2">the fleet and not only individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:12.160" style="s2">vehicles would we see both of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:15.100" style="s2">solutions working together and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.160" end="00:03:17.830" style="s2">ultimately be consumed by when you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.100" end="00:03:19.510" style="s2">here in the sock which i think is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.830" end="00:03:21.460" style="s2">know the acceleration of the stocks</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.510" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">being built product but it was we dived</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.460" end="00:03:26.110" style="s2">across the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:27.590" style="s2">I think us may be ahead of the curve by</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.110" end="00:03:31.660" style="s2">affecting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.590" end="00:03:34.580" style="s2">like a huge other thing for them yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.660" end="00:03:37.790" style="s2">again preciate all of your information</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.580" end="00:03:39.650" style="s2">is there&#39;s a lot to go through here we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.790" end="00:03:42.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of time but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.650" end="00:03:46.310" style="s2">talk real quick so couple things your</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.500" end="00:03:49.160" style="s2">company finds things happening in dis</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:51.950" style="s2">numbers misbehavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.160" end="00:03:53.530" style="s2">solution for everyone out there how what</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.950" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">is the role of it I mean is it a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.530" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">subscriber only it&#39;s everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">so we sell to two types of constituents</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:05.420" style="s2">one is OEMs we some of them directly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:08.030" style="s2">we sell to OEM a OMB does not benefit</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.420" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">and if they&#39;re not our custom because</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.030" end="00:04:13.130" style="s2">it&#39;s away of the data and we will</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">predict their vehicles based and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.130" end="00:04:17.709" style="s2">other constituent that we have is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.660" end="00:04:20.480" style="s2">complete it&#39;s not only isolates like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.709" end="00:04:23.750" style="s2">enterprises that have connected people</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.480" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">police trucks or our companies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.750" end="00:04:28.970" style="s2">very similar but a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">organization but it&#39;s basically they</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.970" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">they share the same problem because if</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">you know I was during lunch I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:40.090" style="s2">telling this example imagine something</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">like the FedEx late day before Christmas</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.090" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">somebody accidentally nope no driver can</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:49.550" style="s2">turn on the FedEx what I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">this all the presses were coming to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:53.130" style="s2">there but what are they herded - OH -</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:55.200" style="s2">whoa</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.130" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">yeah but what about you know again this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.200" end="00:04:58.890" style="s2">whole conversation we&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">about you know how important it is and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.890" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">again I understand collaborates from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">CRC and everyone said this is but a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">certain extent as we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">our learnings on the autonomous cars on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">parts of that works and don&#39;t work or</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">processes or algorithms on the other end</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">on the cybersecurity you know that all</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:23.010" style="s2">of a sudden you realize oh my gosh this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">product or or double or om you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.010" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">after or they&#39;re going after the breaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:29.550" style="s2">north of the steering you know that type</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:31.320" style="s2">of thing is that become a shared economy</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.550" end="00:05:33.180" style="s2">to work where does that what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.320" end="00:05:36.180" style="s2">balance between you being an independent</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.180" end="00:05:39.570" style="s2">company and you know that&#39;s you helping</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">out so we share with the community in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.570" end="00:05:43.470" style="s2">the community shares with us and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.010" end="00:05:47.750" style="s2">been you know I think just last week we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.470" end="00:05:51.750" style="s2">were at Auto eyes that which is a data</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.750" end="00:05:54.510" style="s2">sharing environment or both</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.750" end="00:05:58.200" style="s2">for vendors to share share finding</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.510" end="00:06:01.320" style="s2">spirit we&#39;re part of that having said</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.200" end="00:06:03.750" style="s2">that I think with anybody even you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.320" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">we can find things it&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.750" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">you look let&#39;s say we&#39;re serving okay if</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:10.860" style="s2">he does not have capabilities to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:12.420" style="s2">something with things that we found we</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.860" end="00:06:15.540" style="s2">can share it and they might know about</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.420" end="00:06:18.680" style="s2">know and they might not be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.540" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">anything about it and if you have I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">we&#39;re not number of poems or tabs or in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">the danger zone</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.240" end="00:06:35.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve published privately nada nada the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.640" end="00:06:40.890" style="s2">public I can tell you that you know be</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.790" end="00:06:43.350" style="s2">from this base the I wouldn&#39;t say like</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.890" end="00:06:46.500" style="s2">the best like the nation&#39;s some some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.350" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">the components not the best title</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.500" end="00:06:53.220" style="s2">security practices have used and was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:54.570" style="s2">rated so things that we know in the IT</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.220" end="00:06:57.600" style="s2">side do not so true</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.570" end="00:06:59.160" style="s2">and here&#39;s you still see it like so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.600" end="00:07:00.930" style="s2">so happy we know it didn&#39;t happen for</p>
