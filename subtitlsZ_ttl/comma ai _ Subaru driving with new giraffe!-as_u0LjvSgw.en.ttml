<p begin="00:00:03.080" end="00:00:08.340" style="s2">stop it</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s see oh we got one person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">welcome to four look at this oh do we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:27.110" style="s2">not we&#39;re not posting on Twitter there</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:32.780" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.110" end="00:00:32.780" style="s2">should be hello shared on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.789" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">can we go there we go okay so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.480" end="00:01:03.670" style="s2">61 people Wow 61 people all right so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:08.020" style="s2">these this periscope is to get the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.670" end="00:01:11.350" style="s2">know our port to a new car which is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.020" end="00:01:14.440" style="s2">Subaru yeah nobody would have I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.350" end="00:01:18.100" style="s2">like I guess buddy would have expected</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.440" end="00:01:23.439" style="s2">that cannot see because the new GF is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.100" end="00:01:27.490" style="s2">hidden under the trim which is why the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.439" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">new GF is actually great so this is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.490" end="00:01:33.009" style="s2">a first car that we ported using</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:35.530" style="s2">something that does not require you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.009" end="00:01:39.280" style="s2">permanently remove dreams from your car</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.530" end="00:01:40.990" style="s2">and so you can put back your dreams it</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.280" end="00:01:42.130" style="s2">would be very bad especially like for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.990" end="00:01:44.709" style="s2">super or having to remove the dreams</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.130" end="00:01:47.740" style="s2">because all these piece is like a single</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.709" end="00:01:50.170" style="s2">trim so and there is not much space</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.740" end="00:01:52.179" style="s2">underneath so the really the only</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.170" end="00:01:56.160" style="s2">solution is developing something very</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.179" end="00:02:01.270" style="s2">tiny and I just shuffle it in there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.160" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s working great so some things it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.270" end="00:02:07.869" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any any switch so all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">which are controlled so the stock and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.869" end="00:02:14.220" style="s2">non stock is control to the Panda</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">so we repor pizzelle can and can control</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.220" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">relay and the relay decides if passing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:29.110" style="s2">through the stock system or actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:32.590" style="s2">passing through open pilot so when panda</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.110" end="00:02:35.110" style="s2">sees ten messages like ten messages that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.590" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">open pilot wants to send to the car then</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.110" end="00:02:42.130" style="s2">it automatically open the relay</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:45.580" style="s2">and you disconnect the camera from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.130" end="00:02:47.890" style="s2">rest of the canvas of the car and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.580" end="00:02:49.570" style="s2">you can you can decide what to forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.890" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">and walk to a place so people can</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.570" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">actually water again so what else can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">say about is there any question see I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">missed a lot of questions okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">where&#39;s Jorge yep let&#39;s see let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:13.030" style="s2">no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not your giraffe we we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">built our own let&#39;s see yeah no radar</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.030" end="00:03:18.970" style="s2">everything&#39;s done with the cameras so</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:20.739" style="s2">yeah let alone implementation of open</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.970" end="00:03:23.380" style="s2">pilots because there is no operator in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.739" end="00:03:26.380" style="s2">this car we can&#39;t use the red so we let</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.380" end="00:03:29.260" style="s2">the camera the eyesight system still do</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">the longitudinal controller and we just</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.260" end="00:03:32.920" style="s2">take control of the data value it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:39.070" style="s2">similar to what we do with other cars</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.920" end="00:03:44.620" style="s2">like you and I drew says how some other</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.070" end="00:03:48.070" style="s2">in San Diego oh well you don&#39;t come to</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.989" end="00:04:07.530" style="s2">5.11</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.620" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">see any other questions Oh gia frog see</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.380" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">it was a super heart well great the head</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">off oh yeah so this piece up here which</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">has the Panda this so you have the obd2</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">rj45 and you have a 10 pin connector and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">then you have what&#39;s actually doing all</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.620" end="00:04:50.169" style="s2">he&#39;s got a relay yeah yeah do a nice</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">water through yeah it&#39;s great beef ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.169" end="00:04:56.919" style="s2">pen 26 pin which is you&#39;re gonna be your</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">car harness and that connects to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.919" end="00:05:04.360" style="s2">camera this is just a prototype one the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.250" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">other ones look a lot better yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.360" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">what has you do skies every day yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.570" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">relay which controls everything the 17</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">is what like go connects to your pan</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">announces it is on your car to 10 10</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">cozy Spears up to the Panda up to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">giraffe yes camera cover and the 2016 is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">the single pin connect to do the single</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:35.950" style="s2">connector that like connects the car to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">the camera yep so if you lose if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.950" end="00:05:44.500" style="s2">lose connection it&#39;ll actually switch</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">back to stock automatically yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.500" end="00:05:48.550" style="s2">we can test it basically yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">happens is like if open pile of stops</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.550" end="00:05:54.100" style="s2">working or get disconnected after five</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:58.120" style="s2">seconds the relay will automatically</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.100" end="00:06:00.640" style="s2">close so if for example you connect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.120" end="00:06:02.620" style="s2">yin or the enforce whatever reason stops</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.640" end="00:06:04.180" style="s2">sending canned messages the car will</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.620" end="00:06:07.000" style="s2">fault because you stopped sending</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.180" end="00:06:10.630" style="s2">messages and then after five seconds you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">will the relay will actually close and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.630" end="00:06:14.710" style="s2">you go back to stock of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.150" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">gonna still have some faults in the car</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.710" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">but the idea is that when the car is off</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.250" style="s2">you can disconnect your own and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2">the very simplest way to be back stock</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.250" end="00:06:27.880" style="s2">yeah so the relay will not open if open</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">pilot is not sending Cal messages yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.880" end="00:06:35.259" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:36.759" style="s2">so okay how&#39;s the torque the torque I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.259" end="00:06:43.030" style="s2">would say is definitely better than they</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.759" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">wound up it&#39;s probably a little lower</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.030" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">than the Toyota there is a huge lag in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:53.229" style="s2">controlling in actuator controls so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:57.610" style="s2">proof of weather is familiar weight of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.229" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">pilot code there is power there is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.610" end="00:07:04.750" style="s2">piece in the code where we are called a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:08.110" style="s2">leg doctor it looks like and that&#39;s set</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.750" end="00:07:10.060" style="s2">2.4 seconds for four for the Subaru</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.110" end="00:07:14.389" style="s2">which is a lot but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.060" end="00:07:18.199" style="s2">working pretty well so that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.389" end="00:07:23.719" style="s2">and yes talk level talk level is descent</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.199" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">I would say stock ACC isn&#39;t too bad the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.719" end="00:07:27.409" style="s2">problem is that now we&#39;re stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.370" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">the car is gonna disabled so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.409" end="00:07:33.830" style="s2">do stopping though it can bring you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">stop but then it will auto disable the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.830" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">car I like is you see after three</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:42.199" style="s2">seconds that you&#39;re stopped somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:44.629" style="s2">annoying I believe the reason why they</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.199" end="00:07:46.569" style="s2">do that is because this car is like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.629" end="00:07:49.849" style="s2">handbrake so it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.569" end="00:07:52.219" style="s2">electronic part brake and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.849" end="00:07:54.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have a tronic back brake and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.219" end="00:07:57.620" style="s2">you&#39;re stopped and something bad happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.860" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">and you want to be able to lock the car</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.620" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">and to block the car and have the car</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">standing still and so if you have an APB</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:13.129" style="s2">you can do that if you have handbrake</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">you actually can so will this work on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.129" end="00:08:19.699" style="s2">the Impreza 2019 that&#39;s what this is any</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:25.610" style="s2">prison chosen 18 by the way yes so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.699" end="00:08:27.949" style="s2">port will work with every Subaru that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.610" end="00:08:30.620" style="s2">on the global platform so pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.949" end="00:08:34.669" style="s2">every new Subaru Impreza&#39;s started in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.620" end="00:08:38.539" style="s2">2019 I believe and the some of the 2018</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.669" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">and maybe even 17 outback are on me</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.539" end="00:08:43.550" style="s2">somebody who wear the super can correct</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:45.529" style="s2">me by did all the new Subaru cars are in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.550" end="00:08:48.140" style="s2">this global platform and so this sport</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.529" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">is written for for those cars with minor</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.140" end="00:08:54.380" style="s2">modification I believe like a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.589" end="00:09:40.570" style="s2">find was when we turned off ACC so this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.470" end="00:09:43.240" style="s2">double beep these these double beep is a</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.240" end="00:09:48.550" style="s2">found the easy way to do other type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.360" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">beeps maybe a repeated chime when there</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.550" end="00:09:52.990" style="s2">is somewhat like some important alert to</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:17.050" style="s2">deck is that we can do ACC and I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:20.170" style="s2">say OCC is definitely better than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.050" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">stock ACC with Subaru you get the stock</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.170" end="00:10:26.680" style="s2">ACC which isn&#39;t too bad so in terms of a</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.430" end="00:16:56.020" style="s2">they ask that people drive are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.650" end="00:16:58.930" style="s2">randomly distributed across all the US</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.020" end="00:17:00.640" style="s2">like rolls it&#39;s a given specifically ask</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.930" end="00:17:04.600" style="s2">that people keep driving over and over</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.640" end="00:17:06.189" style="s2">again for most of the time so we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.600" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">believe that if something is missing</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.189" end="00:17:11.920" style="s2">from OpenStreetMap it&#39;s not a much like</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.949" end="00:17:14.350" style="s2">of an issue for any given user to go in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.920" end="00:17:16.750" style="s2">and update it manually that&#39;s therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.350" end="00:17:19.059" style="s2">why we are very happy to say open</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.750" end="00:17:21.309" style="s2">statement because everybody can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.059" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">fix it and update it so we did it I did</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.309" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">it for my copy of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">thoughts on side cameras for lane</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.120" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">changing and freeway exits</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.510" end="00:17:37.210" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:40.090" style="s2">I mean eventually eventually I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.210" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">like putting side cameras and more like</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.090" end="00:17:44.669" style="s2">at another 60 view is gonna help up but</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:49.119" style="s2">honestly like we&#39;re at the point where</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.669" end="00:17:51.820" style="s2">how much more we can do by just like</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.119" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">using a lot better what we have right</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.820" end="00:17:58.029" style="s2">now like we&#39;re not nearly had to leave</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.340" end="00:17:59.529" style="s2">it off using the sensor that we have any</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.029" end="00:18:01.720" style="s2">capability the processing that we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.529" end="00:18:03.850" style="s2">on the yield make sure we could upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.720" end="00:18:08.379" style="s2">the processing jobs to start a process</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:11.169" style="s2">but we could with more sensors for like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.379" end="00:18:14.980" style="s2">how well are utilizing assessment we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.169" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">have like ie like a person could almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.980" end="00:18:19.629" style="s2">perfectly driving I adjusted view that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:22.269" style="s2">you would have from the current camera</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.629" end="00:18:25.299" style="s2">because you cannot safely they change</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.269" end="00:18:27.850" style="s2">but if it happened like side the others</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.299" end="00:18:32.309" style="s2">which most of the new cars have totally</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.850" end="00:18:32.309" style="s2">fine you can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.370" end="00:18:39.909" style="s2">there is huge traffic clear back he can</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.770" end="00:18:39.909" style="s2">went way too far</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">differently we go back no no</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.880" end="00:18:53.460" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a long way back oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.460" style="s2">what happened to George</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.530" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">Pence&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.020" end="00:19:02.610" style="s2">sometimes I thought Subaru was a bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:05.830" style="s2">topic well it&#39;s not banned anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.610" end="00:19:08.860" style="s2">let me look like we were like super oak</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.830" end="00:19:11.980" style="s2">was like a pen topic like what a half</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.860" end="00:19:14.350" style="s2">year ago because we were literally like</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.980" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">one in a year ago when we said super was</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.350" end="00:19:17.890" style="s2">my topic we were supporting how many</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:20.530" style="s2">cups they were supporting like a few on</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.890" end="00:19:23.140" style="s2">thus and we barely started to support to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.530" end="00:19:26.620" style="s2">the office right now turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:27.790" style="s2">Subaru is a low-hanging fruit so which</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.620" end="00:19:30.210" style="s2">is yummy</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.790" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t like that like what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.210" end="00:19:35.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not bad anymore</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:35.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just 19</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.930" end="00:19:46.530" style="s2">like like literally support like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.710" end="00:19:51.350" style="s2">5560 combination of like car makes car</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.530" end="00:19:56.990" style="s2">mother&#39;s mother years because possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.350" end="00:19:59.460" style="s2">provinces as the dildo thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.990" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">coming out the way that we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.460" end="00:20:06.390" style="s2">visioning it back then I mean the deal</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.200" end="00:20:12.330" style="s2">intended as like a simulation when your</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.390" end="00:20:14.220" style="s2">player L yes not not the way that to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">very beginning now I would say like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.220" end="00:20:18.290" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about better strategy</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:20.820" style="s2">later yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.290" end="00:20:24.050" style="s2">but yeah I mean I ran an oscillator</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.820" end="00:20:24.050" style="s2">still still still thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.390" end="00:20:34.430" style="s2">can&#39;t go in here yes right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.570" style="s2">take a look - oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.430" end="00:20:39.070" style="s2">muscle he&#39;s got doesn&#39;t that through</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.570" end="00:20:39.070" style="s2">stopping go so he&#39;s gonna be painful</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.259" end="00:20:51.829" style="s2">like a compiler needs to be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.959" end="00:20:53.569" style="s2">attention to not like the 0.001 percent</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.829" end="00:20:56.419" style="s2">of the people that might be interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.569" end="00:20:57.799" style="s2">into getting like here and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.419" end="00:20:59.749" style="s2">like ik starting on the pilot but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.799" end="00:21:03.469" style="s2">would say more like let&#39;s make this</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.749" end="00:21:04.999" style="s2">product a lot better like we can like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.469" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">are like working harder to turn these</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.999" end="00:21:10.309" style="s2">into like letting out the sugar trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:11.599" style="s2">product this is this is like use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.309" end="00:21:13.399" style="s2">father&#39;s done and then of course like</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.599" end="00:21:15.499" style="s2">making it making it better like</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.399" end="00:21:17.839" style="s2">improving features like a lot of more</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.499" end="00:21:19.339" style="s2">features that are related to maps we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.839" end="00:21:25.549" style="s2">do a lot if you know the maps if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.339" end="00:21:29.389" style="s2">know you can add like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.549" end="00:21:32.329" style="s2">informations like okay like speed limit</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.389" end="00:21:34.819" style="s2">is of course exactly so any place you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.329" end="00:21:37.339" style="s2">can do a lot more you can we already</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.819" end="00:21:40.549" style="s2">slowed down for turns but we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.339" end="00:21:43.669" style="s2">pattern we can no stop sign we can no</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.549" end="00:21:46.699" style="s2">like traffic all these feelings you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.669" end="00:21:49.579" style="s2">them if if you do like a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.699" end="00:21:53.899" style="s2">integration and you can argue that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.579" end="00:21:55.969" style="s2">mean like humans don&#39;t use maps to drive</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.899" end="00:21:59.119" style="s2">like a human can totally do I find</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.969" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">without knowing where it is and without</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.119" end="00:22:03.109" style="s2">knowledge specific features from like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:05.209" style="s2">database but then at the same time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.109" end="00:22:07.159" style="s2">not really at the level that like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.209" end="00:22:09.319" style="s2">can have a machine that rises well as</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.159" end="00:22:10.699" style="s2">good as a human we tell normal self and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.319" end="00:22:12.199" style="s2">information we have somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.699" end="00:22:14.989" style="s2">cheating and getting this information</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.199" end="00:22:18.440" style="s2">from from databases so yeah let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.989" end="00:22:20.719" style="s2">let&#39;s make it a machine a job easier and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.440" end="00:22:23.299" style="s2">let&#39;s use as much as many information as</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.719" end="00:22:25.010" style="s2">we can from existing databases and like</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.299" end="00:22:27.950" style="s2">okay straight Mexican a database</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.010" end="00:22:31.210" style="s2">so more magnification more stability</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.950" end="00:22:33.770" style="s2">less power consumption more features</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.210" end="00:22:37.190" style="s2">definitely like did they actually Trek</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.770" end="00:22:43.179" style="s2">open again I&#39;m not sure like how many of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.190" end="00:22:47.320" style="s2">yous like I&#39;ve listened to Eva masks</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.179" end="00:22:51.260" style="s2">interviews with the legs Freedman about</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.320" end="00:22:54.860" style="s2">what open pilot is and what buying a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.260" end="00:22:56.900" style="s2">Tesla is what he says like what a game</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.860" end="00:22:58.970" style="s2">is if you buy a Taser today you are not</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.900" end="00:23:01.100" style="s2">buying a depreciating better asset</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.970" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">you&#39;re actually buying an appreciating</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.100" end="00:23:08.630" style="s2">asset because the system is gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:11.390" style="s2">better over time and I mean I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.630" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">if they like a mother tree that you buy</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.390" end="00:23:15.460" style="s2">today he&#39;s kind of appreciate over time</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:18.650" style="s2">because it costs quite a bit of money</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.460" end="00:23:20.390" style="s2">stephannie get better over time I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.650" end="00:23:23.630" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna appreciate but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.390" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">give me the price point of the EON well</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.630" end="00:23:28.010" style="s2">maybe yes maybe the you is really like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">depreciating asset like literally</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.010" end="00:23:32.210" style="s2">appreciating upset because things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:35.230" style="s2">the yen is capable of doing is gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.210" end="00:23:35.230" style="s2">that a lot of time so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.260" end="00:23:41.150" style="s2">yeah get the neon and get them after she</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:43.640" style="s2">gets it and then you can recite for more</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.150" end="00:23:45.470" style="s2">because we are indeed maybe raising the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.640" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">price of the yield as the young gets</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.470" end="00:24:01.640" style="s2">better this we asked about afford but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:24:04.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t see it for its we tried it we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.640" end="00:24:07.070" style="s2">really we did release some of the thighs</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.390" end="00:24:08.570" style="s2">honestly carol is more like we just</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.070" end="00:24:11.390" style="s2">released some of the files that makes</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.570" end="00:24:12.380" style="s2">you like the character face like at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.390" end="00:24:15.950" style="s2">car state</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.380" end="00:24:18.020" style="s2">so something that has like like an</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.950" end="00:24:20.900" style="s2">understanding of what what the car can</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.020" end="00:24:22.430" style="s2">is is saying like it&#39;s like all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.900" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">castings not like information about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.430" end="00:24:25.250" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">I didn&#39;t release the things that allows</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.250" end="00:24:30.290" style="s2">open pilot to talk to the car because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.470" end="00:24:31.880" style="s2">was in a Finnish port but honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.290" end="00:24:33.410" style="s2">don&#39;t think it can actually be a Finnish</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.880" end="00:24:34.940" style="s2">board because they have this 10 second</p>
